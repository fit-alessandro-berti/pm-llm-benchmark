10.0

### Evaluation Justification

This response is a flawless 10.0. It is an exemplary answer that meets and exceeds all requirements of the prompt with exceptional clarity, correctness, and thoroughness.

**Strengths:**

1.  **Logical Correctness:** The core logic is impeccable. The use of the `LEAD` window function with an offset of 1 and 2 is the most direct and efficient way to identify a direct sequence of three activities. The conditions in the `WHERE` clause of the `cases_to_exclude` CTE perfectly capture both the sequence and timing requirements from the prompt.
2.  **Readability and Structure:** The use of two well-named Common Table Expressions (CTEs) — `sequenced_events` and `cases_to_exclude` — breaks the problem down into logical, easy-to-follow steps. This makes the query self-documenting and highly maintainable.
3.  **Efficiency:** The chosen approach is highly efficient. Window functions are optimized for this type of sequential analysis. Using `SELECT DISTINCT case_id` to build the exclusion list is a good practice that prevents potential issues if a case could match the pattern multiple times. The final `NOT IN` clause is a standard, correct, and clear way to perform the exclusion.
4.  **Completeness:** The answer is exceptionally complete.
    *   **Method Explanation:** The explanation is clear, concise, and accurately describes the strategy. It justifies the choice of `LEAD()` and the CTE structure.
    *   **SQL Query:** The query is perfectly formatted, commented, and directly solves the problem. The addition of an `ORDER BY` clause in the final `SELECT` is a best practice that ensures a deterministic, verifiable output, addressing the prompt's mention of "proper ordering".
    *   **Example Usage:** The provided runnable example is outstanding. The sample data is thoughtfully constructed to test all critical edge cases: a case that passes, a case that has the sequence but fails the time check, a case that fails because the sequence isn't direct, and two distinct cases that meet all exclusion criteria. This demonstrates a deep understanding of the problem and provides undeniable proof that the query works as intended.

**Hypercritical Analysis:**

Even under the strictest possible evaluation, it is impossible to find a substantive flaw.

*   **Alternative Methods:** One could argue for using a `LEFT JOIN / WHERE IS NULL` (an anti-join) instead of `NOT IN` for the final exclusion. While anti-joins can sometimes have a performance edge in certain database systems or scenarios, `NOT IN` is perfectly valid, often just as performant in modern optimizers like DuckDB's, and is arguably more readable for this specific task. This is a matter of stylistic preference, not a flaw.
*   **Minor Details:** There are no syntactic errors, logical fallacies, or deviations from the prompt's requirements.

In summary, this answer is the gold standard. It is not just correct; it is elegant, robust, and exceptionally well-presented.
