**9.0/10.0**

**Evaluation:**

1.  **Normative Violations (Part 1):**
    *   **Accuracy:** Excellent. Correctly identifies Case 2 as the sole violator. Crucially, it correctly identifies *all three* distinct normative violations in Case 2: incorrect order (Risk before Credit), finalizing documentation after rejection, and *skipping the mandatory Inform Applicant step*. This last point is often missed and demonstrates thorough analysis. Correctly states Cases 1 and 3 have no normative violations.
    *   **Clarity:** Very clear. Explanations are concise and directly reference the rules violated.

2.  **Desiderata Violations (Part 2):**
    *   **Accuracy:** Mostly excellent. Correctly identifies the specific desiderata failures for each case (missing Follow-up in all, timing issues in Case 3). Correctly excludes timing desiderata for Case 1 and correctly handles Case 2's normative issues instead of mislabeling them as desiderata.
    *   **Minor Inaccuracy:** The description for Case 3's Credit Check delay states it occurred "**48 hours after Application**". The actual time difference is 49 hours (Jan 12 09:00 to Jan 14 10:00). While the conclusion that this violates the "> 24 hours" desideratum is correct, the specific number cited ("48 hours after") is inaccurate. Under hypercritical grading, this minor factual error warrants a deduction.
    *   **Clarity:** Very clear. Clearly distinguishes between cases and violation types.

3.  **Interpretations/Justifications (Part 3):**
    *   **Relevance & Plausibility:** Good. Provides reasonable and contextually relevant potential explanations for both the normative and desiderata deviations (e.g., human error, backlog, prioritization).
    *   **Clarity:** Clear and well-organized.

4.  **Overall Structure and Presentation:**
    *   Excellent. The answer is well-structured with clear headings, uses bullet points effectively, and directly addresses all parts of the prompt. Includes a useful summary.

**Reasoning for Grade:**
The answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the difference between normative rules and desiderata, correctly applies these concepts to the event log, and accurately identifies nearly all details. The identification of the *three* normative violations in Case 2 is particularly strong. However, the minor factual inaccuracy regarding the specific duration of the delay in Case 3's Credit Check (citing 48 hours instead of 49) prevents a perfect score under the requirement for hypercritical evaluation. This small error leads to a 1.0 point deduction from a potential 10.0.
