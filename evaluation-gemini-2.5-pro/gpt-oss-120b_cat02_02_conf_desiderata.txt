8.0/10.0

**Grading Rationale:**

The answer is exceptionally well-structured, clear, and demonstrates a deep understanding of the problem. It correctly identifies all the complex normative violations in Case 2 and provides insightful, plausible interpretations for the observed deviations. The inclusion of a summary table and actionable recommendations is a superb addition that goes beyond the prompt's requirements.

However, the evaluation demands hypercritical strictness, and there is one clear, albeit minor, logical flaw.

*   **The Flaw:** In Part 2, "Desiderata failures," the answer incorrectly states that Case 1 has **"None"**. The prompt explicitly lists the "Follow-up Call" as a desideratum ("it is also encouraged—but not strictly required"). Since Case 1 did not have this call, it did fail to meet a desideratum. This error is compounded by the fact that the answer **correctly** identifies the missing "Follow-up Call" as a desideratum failure for Cases 2 and 3, creating a logical inconsistency in how the same rule is applied across different cases.

While the vast majority of the answer is flawless and of a very high quality, this error is a direct misapplication of the provided rules. According to the strict grading instructions, even a minor logical flaw must result in a significant deduction. Therefore, the answer cannot receive a score in the 9-10 range. The final grade reflects the answer's overall excellence while penalizing the specific, demonstrable error.
