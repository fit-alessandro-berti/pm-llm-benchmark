**1. Violating Cases:**
The cases that violate the normative process are:
- **Case 2**
- **Case 3**
- **Case 5**

**2. Explanation of Violations:**

**Case 2:**
- **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> **Package items** -> **Authorize payment** -> Ship order -> Close order
- **Violation:** The activity "Package items" occurred before "Authorize payment".
- **Explanation:** The normative description states: *"Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as "Package items." ... "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging..."* This clearly indicates that "Authorize payment" must precede "Package items". Case 2 violates this order.

**Case 3:**
- **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> **Authorize payment** -> **Cancel order** -> **Ship order** -> Close order
- **Violations:**
    1. "Authorize payment" occurred in a path that led to "Cancel order".
    2. "Ship order" occurred after "Cancel order".
- **Explanation:**
    1. The normative description for an insufficient inventory scenario states: *"if the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock to fulfill the order... after checking the inventory, the process should directly proceed to "Cancel order."* This implies that "Authorize payment" (which is part of the sufficient inventory flow) should not occur if the process is heading towards cancellation.
    2. The description also states: *"Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)... "Ship order" should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation."* Case 3 clearly violates this by performing "Ship order" after "Cancel order".

**Case 5:**
- **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> **Ship order** -> Close order
- **Violation:** The activity "Package items" is missing between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order".
- **Explanation:** The normative description for the sufficient inventory flow states: *"Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as "Package items." Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with "Ship order.""* Case 5 skips the "Package items" step, directly proceeding from "Authorize payment" to "Ship order", which is a violation.
