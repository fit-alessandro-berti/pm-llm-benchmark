9.8/10.0

**Grading Rationale:**

The provided solution is exceptionally good. It is correct, efficient for DuckDB, and perfectly addresses all aspects of the user's prompt.

*   **Correctness:** The query is logically flawless. The use of a `WHERE ... IN` clause with a subquery that groups and filters with `HAVING` is a canonical and accurate way to solve this type of "get me all details for items that satisfy an aggregate condition" problem. It correctly identifies cases with six or fewer events and then retrieves all associated event rows.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The SQL is well-formatted, and the included comments enhance its readability. The step-by-step explanation that follows is a model of clarity, breaking down the query's logic in a way that is easy to understand.
*   **Best Practices:** The solution is idiomatic SQL and represents a common and effective pattern. While a window function or a JOIN could also solve this, the subquery approach is often the most intuitive and readable, and it performs very well in modern engines like DuckDB.

The deduction of 0.2 points is based on a hypercritical interpretation of "flawless." The comment preceding the code block (`-- Keep only cases with ≤ 6 events...`) uses a non-standard Unicode character (`≤ `) instead of the standard ASCII representation (`<=`). While this does not affect the correctness of the SQL logic itself, which correctly uses `<=`, it is a minor presentational blemish that prevents the entire response from being absolutely perfect. In every other respect, the answer is of the highest quality.
