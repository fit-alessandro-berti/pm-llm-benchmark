**8.5/10.0**

**Evaluation:**

1.  **Correctness of Logic:**
    *   The use of `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)` correctly establishes the sequence of events within each case.
    *   The triple self-join in the `triplets` CTE (`e1`, `e2`, `e3`) using `e2.rn = e1.rn + 1` and `e3.rn = e1.rn + 2` correctly identifies sequences of three *directly successive* events.
    *   The `WHERE` clause in `triplets` correctly filters for the specific activity sequence ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order').
    *   The time difference calculation (`e3.timestamp - e2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'`) correctly implements the timing requirement between the second and third event.
    *   The `cases_to_exclude` CTE correctly identifies the `case_id`s meeting both sequence and timing conditions.
    *   The final `SELECT` statement with `WHERE case_id NOT IN (...)` correctly excludes all events from the identified cases.
    *   The final `ORDER BY` clause provides reasonable ordering.

2.  **Hypercritical Issues & Areas for Improvement:**
    *   **Performance:** The primary weakness is the use of three self-joins on the `ordered_events` CTE. While logically correct for finding direct successors, this approach can be significantly less performant on large event logs compared to using window functions like `LAG` or `LEAD`. A more optimized approach would typically use `LAG` twice to check the preceding two activities and timestamps within a single pass. (Significant deduction under strict grading)
    *   **Timestamp Ties:** The `ROW_NUMBER()` function relies solely on `timestamp` for ordering within a case. If multiple events within the same case have the exact same timestamp, the ordering (and thus the `rn` assigned) becomes non-deterministic. This could potentially lead to inconsistent identification of "direct succession" across different runs or database versions, although it's an edge case. Adding a deterministic tie-breaker (e.g., a unique event ID if available, or even `activity` as a last resort, though less ideal) to the `ORDER BY` clause within `ROW_NUMBER` would make the solution more robust. (Minor deduction)
    *   **`SELECT *`:** Using `SELECT *` in the final query is generally considered poor practice in production code. It lacks explicitness, can pull unnecessary data, and is vulnerable to schema changes (e.g., adding new columns). Explicitly listing the required columns (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`, etc.) is preferred. While it fulfills the prompt's request to "return all events", it's stylistically suboptimal. (Minor deduction)
    *   **Readability of Join Condition:** While the `eN.rn = e(N-1).rn + 1` logic is correct, using `LAG` might be considered slightly more idiomatic SQL for sequence analysis nowadays. However, the join approach is arguably a very direct translation of "sequence of three".

**Conclusion:**

The query is logically sound and correctly implements all the requirements of the prompt. The use of CTEs makes it reasonably readable. However, under hypercritical evaluation, the performance implications of the triple self-join (compared to alternatives like `LAG`), the theoretical robustness issue with timestamp ties, and the use of `SELECT *` prevent it from achieving a perfect score. The performance aspect is the most significant point for deduction in a practical context, even if not strictly a logical flaw according to the prompt's wording.
