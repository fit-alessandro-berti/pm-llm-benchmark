**Summary Explanation:**

1.  **Case Identification:**
    *   Cases are defined by the primary document or task the user is focused on. This is primarily inferred from the `Window` attribute in the log. For example, all activities related to `Document1.docx` are grouped under `DOC1`, handling the email about "Annual Meeting" becomes `EMAIL1`, and so on.
    *   When the user switches to a new document (e.g., `Report_Draft.pdf`), a new case (`PDF1`) is initiated.
    *   If the user returns to a previously worked-on document (e.g., back to `Document1.docx`), the activities are appended to the existing case for that document (`DOC1`).
    *   The initial `FOCUS` event on `Quarterly_Report.docx` at `08:59:50.000Z` was excluded as it was immediately followed by a `FOCUS` on `Document1.docx` with no intervening activity, suggesting it wasn't a substantive work session for that document at that point.

2.  **Activity Naming:**
    *   Low-level actions are translated into more descriptive, process-oriented activity names.
    *   `FOCUS` events that initiate work on a document/task are labeled as "Start Working on Document/Budget" or "Resume Working on Document" if it's a return to a previous task.
    *   `TYPING` events are converted to "Edit Document Section" or "Draft Reply," with the `Keys` attribute often providing context for a more specific description (e.g., "Draft Intro," "Confirm Meeting Details").
    *   `CLICK` actions in specific contexts (like email) are mapped to user intentions, such as "Open Email," "Compose Reply," or "Send Email."
    *   `SAVE` and `CLOSE` actions are retained as distinct activities, signifying milestones.
    *   `SCROLL` is interpreted as "Review Content" (e.g., "Review Email Content," "Review PDF Content").
    *   `HIGHLIGHT` becomes a specific action like "Highlight Key Findings."
    *   `SWITCH` events are used to identify transitions between cases but are not themselves logged as activities within a case, as they represent context shifts rather than work on a specific task.

3.  **Event Attributes:**
    *   **Case ID**: A unique identifier for each logical unit of work (e.g., `DOC1`, `EMAIL1`).
    *   **Activity Name**: The standardized, meaningful name of the activity performed.
    *   **Timestamp**: The original timestamp from the system log.
    *   **Additional Attributes**: Relevant information like the specific document name, email subject, or details from the `Keys` or `Text` fields are included to provide richer context for each event.

4.  **Coherent Narrative:**
    *   The resulting event log aims to provide a clear story of the user's work session. For instance, it shows the user starting work on `Document1.docx`, then switching to handle an email, then reviewing a PDF, working on an Excel budget, returning to `Document1.docx` to incorporate information, and finally working on `Quarterly_Report.docx`. This structure facilitates process discovery and analysis, allowing insights into how tasks are performed and interleaved.
