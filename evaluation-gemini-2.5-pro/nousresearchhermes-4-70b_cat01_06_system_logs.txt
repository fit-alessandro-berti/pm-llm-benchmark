### Explanation of Logic

**1. Case Identification:**
The core principle for defining a "case" is the logical unit of work the user is performing, which is centered around a specific document, file, or task.

-   **Document-based Cases:** For applications like Word, Excel, and Acrobat, the document's filename (found in the `Window` attribute) serves as the unique `Case ID`. This correctly groups all related activities, even when the user switches away and returns to the document later (e.g., the work on `Document1.docx` is part of a single case despite being interrupted).
-   **Task-based Cases (Email):** For generic application windows like `Email - Inbox`, using the window title as a case ID would be too broad. Instead, a more granular case is identified from the user's action. The `CLICK` event with `Action=Open Email about Annual Meeting` allows us to create a specific case, `Email: Annual Meeting`. All subsequent activities within the email client are assigned to this case until the user switches to another application.

**2. Activity Naming and Transformation:**
Low-level system actions were translated into standardized, high-level process activities to create a meaningful process model.

-   `FOCUS`: This action is interpreted based on context. The *first* time a case (document) is focused on, the activity is `Open Document`. Subsequent `FOCUS` events on the same case are labeled `Resume Work`.
-   `SWITCH`: This action signifies a transition between cases. It is mapped to the activity `Open Application` and is assigned as the first event of the *target* case, clearly marking the start of a new work context.
-   `TYPING`: Standardized to `Edit Content`.
-   `CLICK`: Mapped to more descriptive activities based on the `Action` attribute, such as `Open Email`, `Reply to Email`, and `Send Email`.
-   Other actions like `SAVE`, `SCROLL`, `HIGHLIGHT`, and `CLOSE` are given clear, standardized names (`Save Document`, `Scroll Document`, etc.).

This transformation results in a clean, coherent event log that accurately represents the user's multi-tasking behavior, making it ideal for process discovery and analysis.
