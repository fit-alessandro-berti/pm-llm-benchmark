6.0/10.0

**Evaluation:**

1.  **Constraint Adherence (Major Flaw):** Question 3 ("Can you elaborate on the 'central property database' you use? What kind of information architecture does it use...") directly asks about "information architecture". This term strongly implies technical implementation details (like database schema design, data modeling approach, relationships), which the prompt explicitly forbids ("These questions should not request any SQL queries or **implementation details**"). This is a significant violation of the negative constraints. A better question would focus purely on the *types* of information stored and *how* it's used conceptually in downstream processes, avoiding technical jargon.

2.  **Completeness (Minor Flaw):** The prompt explicitly mentions "verify timing and sequencing" as one of the goals for the questions. However, none of the provided questions directly probe the duration of process steps, typical timelines, potential delays, or the strictness of the sequence. For example, questions like "What is the average time from initial landlord contact to property activation?" or "Are the inspection and marketing phases sequential, or can they overlap?" are missing. This represents a gap in addressing all stated objectives.

3.  **Question Phrasing (Minor Point):** While most questions are open-ended, Question 6 ("...is there ever a scenario where...") could technically be answered with a yes/no, although it implies elaboration. Phrasing like "Under what circumstances..." is generally stronger for guaranteeing an open-ended response. This is a minor stylistic point, not a major flaw.

4.  **Strengths:**
    *   **Coverage:** The questions cover most stages of the described process well (documentation, assignment, inspection, marketing, screening, audits, exceptions).
    *   **Targeting:** Questions are generally specific and target relevant aspects like decision criteria (Q1, Q4, Q10, Q17), roles/responsibilities (Q12, Q15), process details (Q7, Q9, Q13), and exception handling (Q2, Q8, Q14, Q16, Q17).
    *   **Conceptual Focus:** Apart from Q3, the questions successfully maintain a conceptual focus, seeking to understand the 'what', 'why', 'who', and 'how' of the process without delving into technical specifics.
    *   **Clarity:** The questions are clearly worded and easy to understand.

**Justification for Score (6.0/10.0):**

The score is significantly reduced from a potential high score primarily due to the violation of the "no implementation details" constraint in Question 3. Given the instruction for "utmost strictness" and that "even minor issues should result in a significantly lower score," this direct violation warrants a substantial deduction (-3 points). The lack of questions addressing timing/sequencing, despite it being a stated goal, constitutes another flaw warranting a deduction (-1 point). While the remaining 19 questions are generally good to excellent and demonstrate a strong grasp of the task, the explicit flaws prevent a higher score under the strict evaluation criteria requested.
