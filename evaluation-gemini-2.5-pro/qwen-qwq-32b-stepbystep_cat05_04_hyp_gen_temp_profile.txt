### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

Based on the provided temporal profile model for the insurance claim handling process, the following anomalies are identified:

1.  **Receive (R) to Approve (P) - Low Standard Deviation:** The average time is approximately 25 hours (90000 seconds), but the standard deviation is only 1 hour (3600 seconds). For a multi-step path (presumably R -> A -> E -> P), this low variability is suspicious. It suggests an overly rigid process step, possibly automated or strictly scheduled, that doesn't account for natural variations in evaluation time.
2.  **Approve (P) to Notify (N) - Long Average Time & High Standard Deviation:** An average delay of 7 days (604800 seconds) between approval and customer notification is unusually long. The high standard deviation of 2 days (172800 seconds) indicates significant inconsistency in this step, with some notifications potentially taking much longer.
3.  **Assign (A) to Close (C) - Short Average Time:** An average time of only 2 hours (7200 seconds) from assignment to closure is very short, especially considering the intermediate steps of Evaluation (E), Approval (P), and Notification (N) are expected. This suggests that some claims might be bypassing these critical steps and being closed prematurely.
4.  **Evaluate (E) to Notify (N) - Very Short Average Time:** The average time of 5 minutes (300 seconds) between evaluation and notification is extremely short. According to the intended process flow (E -> P -> N), the Approval (P) step should occur between Evaluation and Notification. This short duration implies that either the Approval step is being skipped or Notification is incorrectly occurring before Approval.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

Here are potential hypotheses explaining the observed anomalies:

1.  **R to P (Low STDEV):**
    *   *Hypothesis:* A system automation or strict Service Level Agreement (SLA) forces the transition from Receive to Approve within a fixed timeframe (around 25 hours), potentially bypassing or standardizing the Evaluation ('E') step, thus eliminating expected variability.
2.  **P to N (Long Average, High STDEV):**
    *   *Hypothesis:* There's a significant bottleneck in the notification process. This could stem from manual processing delays, reliance on weekly batch jobs for notifications (explaining the ~7 day average), or resource limitations in the department responsible for sending notifications. The high variability might be due to differing priorities or workload fluctuations.
3.  **A to C (Short Average):**
    *   *Hypothesis:* Specific claim types (e.g., very low amount, specific coverage denials) or actions by certain adjusters might lead to immediate closure after assignment, skipping the full E-P-N sequence. This could be a process shortcut (intended or unintended) or data entry errors marking claims as closed prematurely.
4.  **E to N (Short Average):**
    *   *Hypothesis:* A system configuration error or workflow flaw triggers the Notification ('N') event immediately after Evaluation ('E') is completed, incorrectly bypassing or occurring before the required Approval ('P') step.

### Verification Approaches using SQL Queries

Below are SQL queries (PostgreSQL syntax) designed to investigate these hypotheses by identifying specific claims exhibiting anomalous behavior.

1.  **Verify R to P Anomaly (Investigate potentially skipped 'E' step):**
    *   *Query:* Identify claims where the R-to-P duration is close to the 25-hour average (within ±1 STDEV) but lack an 'E' event occurring between 'R' and 'P'.

    ```sql
    -- Find claims with R-P duration ~25h missing the E step in between
    SELECT r.claim_id,
           EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) AS rp_duration_seconds
    FROM claim_events r
    JOIN claim_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
    WHERE r.activity = 'R'
      AND p.timestamp > r.timestamp
      -- Check if duration is within 1 STDEV of the average
      AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) BETWEEN (90000 - 3600) AND (90000 + 3600)
      -- Check if no 'E' event exists between 'R' and 'P'
      AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM claim_events e
        WHERE e.claim_id = r.claim_id
          AND e.activity = 'E'
          AND e.timestamp > r.timestamp
          AND e.timestamp < p.timestamp
      );
    ```

2.  **Verify P to N Anomaly (Investigate long delays):**
    *   *Query:* Identify claims where the time between Approval ('P') and Notification ('N') significantly exceeds the average, for example, longer than 9 days (Average + 1 STDEV).

    ```sql
    -- Find claims with P-N duration longer than 9 days
    SELECT p.claim_id,
           EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) / 86400.0 AS pn_duration_days -- 86400 seconds in a day
    FROM claim_events p
    JOIN claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
    WHERE p.activity = 'P'
      AND n.timestamp > p.timestamp -- Ensure N is after P
      -- Duration > 7 days (avg) + 2 days (stdev) = 9 days
      AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) > (604800 + 172800)
    ORDER BY pn_duration_days DESC;
    ```
    *Further Step:* Correlate results with `claims.claim_type` or `adjusters` (if resource links to adjuster).

3.  **Verify A to C Anomaly (Investigate premature closure):**
    *   *Query:* Identify claims closed very quickly after assignment (e.g., under 2 hours) and explicitly check if 'E' and 'P' steps occurred between 'A' and 'C'.

    ```sql
    -- Find claims with A-C duration under 2 hours lacking E or P steps in between
    SELECT a.claim_id,
           EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_evt.timestamp - a.timestamp)) AS ac_duration_seconds
    FROM claim_events a
    JOIN claim_events c_evt ON a.claim_id = c_evt.claim_id AND c_evt.activity = 'C'
    WHERE a.activity = 'A'
      AND c_evt.timestamp > a.timestamp -- Ensure C is after A
      -- Duration < 2 hours (model average)
      AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_evt.timestamp - a.timestamp)) < 7200
      -- Check if EITHER 'E' OR 'P' step is missing between 'A' and 'C'
      AND (
        NOT EXISTS (
          SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e WHERE e.claim_id = a.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'
          AND e.timestamp > a.timestamp AND e.timestamp < c_evt.timestamp
        )
        OR NOT EXISTS (
          SELECT 1 FROM claim_events p WHERE p.claim_id = a.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
          AND p.timestamp > a.timestamp AND p.timestamp < c_evt.timestamp
        )
      );
    ```

4.  **Verify E to N Anomaly (Investigate incorrect sequencing):**
    *   *Query:* Identify claims where the Notification ('N') event timestamp is earlier than the Approval ('P') event timestamp, directly violating the intended process sequence.

    ```sql
    -- Find claims where Notification ('N') happened before Approval ('P')
    SELECT n.claim_id
    FROM claim_events n
    JOIN claim_events p ON n.claim_id = p.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
    WHERE n.activity = 'N'
      -- Check if N's timestamp is strictly before P's timestamp
      AND n.timestamp < p.timestamp;
    ```
