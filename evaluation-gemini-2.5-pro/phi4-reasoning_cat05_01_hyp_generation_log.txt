Based on the sample event log data, several anomalies stand out when compared to the assumed normal process flow (Register Order  Perform Credit Check  Validate Stock  Confirm Shipment  Ship Goods  Issue Invoice  Receive Payment). Below is a summary of the observed issues along with hypotheses and example SQL queries that can help investigate these anomalies.

  
1. Anomalies Identified

• Case 1002 – Out-of-Sequence Events:  
– “Confirm Shipment” (event id:9) and “Ship Goods” (event id:10) occur before the subsequent “Perform Credit Check” (id:11) and “Validate Stock” (id:12).  
Hypothesis: This might indicate a process shortcut, a system misconfiguration, or manual intervention that bypassed critical checks. Alternatively, it may be an error in event logging.

• Case 1003 – Inconsistent Order of Shipment Confirmation:  
– “Ship Goods” (id:17) is executed before “Confirm Shipment” (id:19).  
Hypothesis: This could result from human error or a timing lag in updating the confirmation event. It might also suggest that shipments were shipped based on an estimated schedule, with the confirmation logged later.

• Case 1004 – Multiple Process Deviations:  
– “Receive Payment” (id:22) occurs almost immediately after order registration (id:21).  
– “Issue Invoice” (id:23) follows payment, contrary to the expected sequence.  
– “Confirm Shipment” (id:24) is logged after “Ship Goods” (id:25), and its additional info (“shipment_scheduled=N”) indicates that shipment was not planned despite goods being shipped.  
Hypothesis: The premature payment receipt may point to data entry errors or even fraudulent activity; the delayed invoice issuance could be due to process inefficiencies, and the reversed order of shipment events strongly suggests non-compliance with standard operating procedures.

  
2. Proposed SQL Queries for Investigation

Below are some example queries (tailored for PostgreSQL) that can help identify these irregularities. You may need to adjust them based on your specific environment and additional business rules.

A. Detect Orders Where “Ship Goods” Occurs Before “Confirm Shipment”

```sql
SELECT 
  a.case_id,
  a.timestamp AS ship_goods_time,
  b.timestamp AS confirm_shipment_time
FROM order_event_log a
JOIN order_event_log b 
  ON a.case_id = b.case_id 
     AND b.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
WHERE a.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND a.timestamp < b.timestamp;
```

B. Identify Orders Where “Perform Credit Check” or “Validate Stock” Occur After “Ship Goods”

-- For Credit Check:
```sql
SELECT 
  a.case_id,
  a.timestamp AS ship_goods_time,
  b.timestamp AS credit_check_time
FROM order_event_log a
JOIN order_event_log b 
  ON a.case_id = b.case_id 
     AND b.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
WHERE a.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND a.timestamp < b.timestamp;
```

-- For Stock Validation:
```sql
SELECT 
  a.case_id,
  a.timestamp AS ship_goods_time,
  b.timestamp AS validate_stock_time
FROM order_event_log a
JOIN order_event_log b 
  ON a.case_id = b.case_id 
     AND b.activity = 'Validate Stock'
WHERE a.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND a.timestamp < b.timestamp;
```

C. Check for Early Payment Relative to Invoice Issuance

```sql
SELECT 
  a.case_id,
  a.timestamp AS payment_time,
  b.timestamp AS invoice_time
FROM order_event_log a
JOIN order_event_log b 
  ON a.case_id = b.case_id 
     AND b.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
WHERE a.activity = 'Receive Payment'
  AND a.timestamp < b.timestamp;
```

D. Identify Cases with Immediate or Out-of-Order Events  
This query shows all events for each case to help spot anomalies in the overall sequence:

```sql
SELECT 
  case_id,
  event_id,
  activity,
  timestamp
FROM order_event_log
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

E. (Optional) Validate Resource Roles for Payment and Shipment Activities

```sql
-- Verify that "Receive Payment" events are performed by Finance personnel.
SELECT *
FROM order_event_log
WHERE activity = 'Receive Payment'
  AND resource NOT LIKE 'FinanceTeam_%';
```

```sql
-- Check shipment confirmation events with a negative indication (e.g., shipment_scheduled=N)
SELECT *
FROM order_event_log
WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
  AND additional_info NOT LIKE '%Y%';
```

  
3. Final Notes

• These queries are starting points for investigation; they can be refined further by integrating window functions or using lateral joins to analyze event sequences more comprehensively.  
• Combining data from the orders and resources tables might provide further context—for instance, verifying that the order values align with the payment amounts or confirming resource roles during critical events.
