### Evaluation

The provided solution correctly identifies the logical steps required to solve the problem and translates them into a clear, well-structured SQL query using Common Table Expressions (CTEs). The use of `array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp)` is the correct and idiomatic approach in DuckDB to generate the ordered activity sequences. The subsequent steps to count variants, find the top ones, and filter the original log are also logically sound.

However, the evaluation is performed with the utmost strictness, and there are specific points of critique:

1.  **Syntactical Invalidity (`LIMIT K`)**: The most significant flaw is the use of `LIMIT K`. While the prompt uses the placeholder "K", a valid SQL query cannot contain an un-substituted variable like this. The query as written is not executable and would produce a syntax error. A flawless answer would have either used a specific example value (e.g., `LIMIT 3`) with a comment explaining it's a placeholder for K, or used the proper syntax for a parameterized query (e.g., `LIMIT ?`). This is a direct inaccuracy in the constructed query.

2.  **Slightly Sub-optimal Readability in Final Clause**: The final `SELECT` statement uses a nested subquery: `WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM ... WHERE activity_sequence IN (SELECT ...))`. While logically correct, a slightly cleaner and potentially more readable approach would be to define another CTE for the `selected_cases` and then join or use `IN` on that CTE. This is a minor stylistic point, but in a hypercritical evaluation, it detracts from perfection.

3.  **Efficiency Considerations**: While DuckDB's optimizer is excellent and would likely handle the nested `IN` clauses well, a more traditional and explicitly optimizable pattern would involve using `JOIN`s. For instance, joining `case_sequences` with `top_variants` to get the target `case_id`s, and then joining that result back to the `event_log`. The chosen `IN` approach is not incorrect, but it relies more heavily on the optimizer's capabilities compared to a direct join strategy.

The core logic is excellent, demonstrating a strong understanding of the problem and DuckDB's capabilities. However, the syntactical error in the `LIMIT` clause is a notable flaw that prevents the query from being directly usable, which is a key requirement of the prompt. Therefore, the score is significantly reduced from a potential perfect 10.

### Final Answer

```sql
-- K is a placeholder for the desired number of top variants (e.g., 3)
-- In a real application, this would be a parameter. For this query, we use a literal value.
DEFINE K = 3;

WITH case_sequences AS (
    -- 1. Determine the ordered sequence of activities for each case
    SELECT
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    -- 2. Group by sequence to find unique variants and count their frequency
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
),
top_k_variants AS (
    -- 3. Identify the top K most frequent variants
    SELECT
        activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT K
)
-- 4. Return all original events for cases that belong to the top K variants
SELECT
    event_log.*
FROM event_log
JOIN case_sequences ON event_log.case_id = case_sequences.case_id
WHERE
    case_sequences.activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_k_variants);
