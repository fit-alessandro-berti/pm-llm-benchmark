10.0

### Grading Rationale

The provided answer is flawless. It is a perfect, textbook solution to the problem described in the prompt.

1.  **Correctness:** The SQL query is 100% correct. It correctly uses a subquery with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to first identify the `case_id`s that meet the criteria (<= 6 events) and then uses the `IN` operator to filter the main table, returning all events for only those cases. This precisely matches the prompt's requirements.

2.  **Clarity and Structure:** The answer is exceptionally well-structured.
    *   The "Approach" section clearly and concisely breaks down the logic into three distinct, correct steps.
    *   The "Solution Code" is presented cleanly.
    *   The "Explanation" accurately describes how the query works, linking the syntax directly to the logic.

3.  **Efficiency:** The chosen method (`WHERE ... IN (subquery)`) is a standard, highly readable, and efficient way to solve this type of problem. Modern query planners like DuckDB's are very effective at optimizing this pattern, often converting it to an efficient semi-join. While other valid methods exist (e.g., using a CTE with a `JOIN` or a window function), the provided solution is arguably one of the most direct and idiomatic. There is no performance-related flaw.

The response is concise, accurate, and demonstrates a complete understanding of the task. It contains no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws, thus earning the maximum score under the specified strict grading criteria.
