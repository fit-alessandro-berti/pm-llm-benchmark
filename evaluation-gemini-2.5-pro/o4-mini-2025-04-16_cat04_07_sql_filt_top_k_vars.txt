**Grade: 9.8/10.0**

**Evaluation:**

1.  **Correctness of Logic:**
    *   **Task 1 (Sequence per Case):** The `case_variants` CTE correctly uses `LIST_AGG(activity, '->') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp)` grouped by `case_id`. This accurately constructs the ordered sequence of activities for each case, fulfilling the definition of a process variant. (Pass)
    *   **Task 2 (Group by Variant):** The `variant_counts` CTE correctly groups the results from `case_variants` by the generated `variant` string. (Pass)
    *   **Task 3 (Count & Top K):** The `variant_counts` CTE correctly counts cases per variant (`COUNT(*)`) orders them by frequency (`ORDER BY case_count DESC`), and selects the top K (`LIMIT :K`). (Pass)
    *   **Task 4 (Filter Original Events):** The `top_cases` CTE correctly identifies the `case_id`s belonging to the top K variants by joining `case_variants` and `variant_counts`. The final `SELECT` statement correctly joins the original `event_log` with `top_cases` on `case_id` to filter the events and selects all original columns (`el.*`). (Pass)

2.  **Adherence to Prompt Requirements:**
    *   Uses DuckDB SQL: Yes.
    *   Uses specified table/column names: Yes.
    *   Parameterizes K: Yes, using `:K`.
    *   Returns *original events*: Yes, `SELECT el.*` achieves this.
    *   Filters correctly to *only* top K variant cases: Yes, the join logic ensures this.

3.  **Clarity and Structure:**
    *   The use of CTEs (`WITH` clauses) makes the query highly readable and breaks down the logic into understandable steps.
    *   Variable names (`case_variants`, `variant_counts`, `top_cases`, `case_count`, `variant`) are clear and descriptive.
    *   The final `ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp` is not strictly required by the prompt for the final output, but it's good practice for presenting event log data logically and doesn't violate any requirement.

4.  **Hypercritical Analysis & Minor Issues:**
    *   **Separator Choice (`->`):** While visually intuitive, using `->` in `LIST_AGG` introduces a *theoretical* risk. If an activity name itself contained the string `->`, it could lead to ambiguity if the resulting `variant` string were ever *parsed* back into activities. However, for the purpose of *grouping* identical sequences (comparing the generated strings for equality), this is not a functional flaw *within this query*. The query correctly groups cases with the exact same ordered sequence of activities. This is a very minor point, often acceptable in practice unless specifically prohibited.
    *   **Performance/Scalability:** For extremely long cases (many events), `LIST_AGG` creating very long strings might have performance implications or hit potential length limits (though DuckDB's limits are generally high). Using `LIST()` to create an actual list/array type might be theoretically more robust for very large datasets or complex post-processing, but string aggregation is standard for variant analysis and perfectly acceptable here. This is not a flaw in correctness.

**Conclusion:**

The provided solution is excellent. It correctly interprets and implements all requirements of the prompt using clear, idiomatic SQL suitable for DuckDB. The logic is sound, and the structure is commendable. The only point preventing a perfect 10.0 under the "hypercritical" lens is the *theoretical* (though practically unlikely in most scenarios and not affecting the query's internal logic) ambiguity introduced by the `->` separator choice in `LIST_AGG`. This is a very minor point, hence only a minimal deduction. The query is otherwise functionally flawless and directly addresses the prompt.
