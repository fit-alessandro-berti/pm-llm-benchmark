**Evaluation:**

The provided SQL query is a flawless and optimal solution to the problem described in the prompt. It correctly and efficiently addresses all four requirements of the task.

1.  **Correctness of Logic:** The query's logic is perfectly sound. It uses a sequence of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the problem into logical, manageable steps:
    *   `case_variants`: Correctly identifies the ordered sequence of activities for each `case_id` using `STRING_AGG` with an `ORDER BY` clause, which is the idiomatic and correct approach in DuckDB.
    *   `variant_counts`: Accurately groups by the generated variant strings and counts the number of cases for each, determining the frequency.
    *   `top_variants`: Correctly isolates the top K most frequent variants by ordering by the count and applying a `LIMIT`.
    *   Final `SELECT`: Efficiently filters the original `event_log` by joining it back to the CTEs that identify which cases belong to the top K variants. This ensures only the required events are returned.

2.  **Efficiency:** The solution is highly efficient. By calculating the `case_variants` once in a CTE and reusing it, it avoids redundant computations. The use of `JOIN` in the final step is generally more performant than a `WHERE ... IN (SELECT ...)` subquery, representing a well-optimized approach.

3.  **Readability and Structure:** The query is exceptionally well-structured and readable. The descriptive names for the CTEs (`case_variants`, `variant_counts`, `top_variants`) make the query self-documenting and easy to follow.

4.  **Adherence to Prompt:** The query meets every single requirement of the prompt without any deviation or omission. It returns the exact data requested in the specified format (all columns from the original log for the relevant cases).

In summary, the solution is exemplary. It demonstrates a deep understanding of SQL, process mining concepts, and best practices for writing clean, efficient, and correct queries. There are no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws.
