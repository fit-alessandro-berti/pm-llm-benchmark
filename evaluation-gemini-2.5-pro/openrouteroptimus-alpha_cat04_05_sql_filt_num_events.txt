**Grade: 10.0/10.0**

**Evaluation:**

1.  **Correctness:** The query logic is perfectly correct. It accurately identifies the `case_id`s that meet the criteria (<= 6 events) using a subquery with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, and then filters the original `event_log` table to include only rows matching these `case_id`s. This precisely fulfills the requirements stated in the prompt.
2.  **Syntax:** The SQL syntax is valid for DuckDB and standard SQL implementations. It uses common constructs (`SELECT *`, `FROM`, `WHERE IN`, `SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING COUNT(*)`) correctly.
3.  **Clarity and Readability:** The query is well-formatted and easy to understand. The use of a subquery makes the two steps (identifying relevant cases, then retrieving their events) distinct and logical.
4.  **Efficiency:** While alternative approaches exist (e.g., using window functions like `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)`), the `IN` subquery approach is a standard, valid, and often well-optimized method, especially in modern query engines like DuckDB. It directly translates the problem description into SQL. The prompt didn't require the absolute most performant solution, just a correct one, and this solution is correct and idiomatic.
5.  **Adherence to Prompt:** The query specifically addresses all parts of the prompt: uses the specified table (`event_log`) and columns (`case_id`), filters based on the event count per case (<= 6), and returns the complete event rows (`SELECT *`) for the qualifying cases.
6.  **Explanation:** The provided explanation is concise, accurate, and clearly describes how the query achieves the desired outcome by breaking down the roles of the subquery and the outer query.

**Conclusion:**

The provided answer is functionally perfect according to the prompt's requirements. The SQL query is correct, adheres to standard practices, is clear, and directly solves the stated problem. The explanation accurately reflects the query's logic. Under hypercritical evaluation, there are no identifiable inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws concerning the prompt's requirements. While alternative SQL formulations exist, the provided solution is a canonical and correct way to address this task. Therefore, it merits the maximum score.
