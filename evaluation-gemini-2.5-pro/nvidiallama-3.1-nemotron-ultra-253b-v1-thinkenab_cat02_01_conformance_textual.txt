**2. Explanation of Violations:**

**Case 2**
- **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment".
- **Explanation:** The normative process description states: "...the process should include the authorization of payment... Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.'" This implies "Authorize payment" must happen before "Package items." In Case 2, "Package items" (10:00) occurs before "Authorize payment" (10:30), violating this sequence.

**Case 3**
- **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order".
- **Explanation:** The normative process describes the cancellation scenario: "...after checking the inventory, the process should directly proceed to 'Cancel order.' Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)..." In Case 3, "Ship order" (10:30) occurs after "Cancel order" (10:00). Shipping an order that has been canceled is a clear deviation.

**Case 5**
- **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs without a preceding "Package items" activity after "Authorize payment".
- **Explanation:** The normative process for a fulfilled order specifies: "Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'" In Case 5, the sequence goes from "Authorize payment" (10:30) directly to "Ship order" (11:00), skipping the "Package items" step. This violates the requirement that items must be packaged before they are shipped.
