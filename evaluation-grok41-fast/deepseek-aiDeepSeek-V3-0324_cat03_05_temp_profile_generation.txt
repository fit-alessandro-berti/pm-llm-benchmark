7.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (supporting ~7 base)**: Correct format (valid Python dict with tuple keys/values in seconds). Includes a representative subset (~19 pairs) mixing direct (e.g., ('SS','OP')) and multi-step (e.g., ('SS','PT')) for complexity. Most estimates plausible individually for supply chain (procurement in days/weeks, internal in hours, logistics variable). Many cumulatives consistent (e.g., SS-OP + OP-RC  SS-RC; QI-CA + CA-PT  QI-PT; OP-QI  OP-RC + RC-QI). Stdevs scale reasonably larger for distant pairs. Explanatory comments/notes add clarity without violating task.
- **Major Logical Flaws/Inaccuracies (heavy deductions)**: Cumulative times inconsistent across pairs, undermining model validity:
  | Flawed Pair | Dict Value (days) | Expected from Direct Pairs (days) | Error |
  |-------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|-------|
  | ('RC','DT') | 14 | ~4.25 (RC-QI + QI-CA + CA-PT + PT-PK + PK-WS + WS-DT = 367200s) | +10d (copy-paste from OP-RC?) |
  | ('CA','AS') | 14 | ~10.75 (CA-PT + PT-PK + PK-WS + WS-DT + DT-AS = 928800s) | +3d overestimate |
  - Implies absurd totals (e.g., OP-DT  OP-RC + RC-DT = 28d, but OP-PK 15.5d + PK-WS + WS-DT 18.6d  contradiction).
  - Notes claim "derived by summing," but clearly not for these—direct contradiction.
- **Minor Issues (further deductions)**: Omissions noted (e.g., ('SS','AS')), but subset allowed—still highlights incompleteness. Extra text (assumptions/notes) beyond "produce a dictionary" adds bulk without request. Minor comment nit (e.g., "~15 days ± 2.1 days" for 180000s=exactly 15d ±2.08d). No reverse pairs (correct), but no evidence of non-linear traces despite "at least one execution" phrasing.
- **Overall**: Strong effort with good intent/coverage, but logical inconsistencies in core cross-stage pairs (not "estimated" but provably wrong vs. own data) prevent >7. Not "nearly flawless"—flaws are evident on basic summation check, failing strict temporal profile model.
