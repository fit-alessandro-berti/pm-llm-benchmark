**10.0**

The final output is a flawless Python dictionary that precisely matches all specifications: valid syntax, correct tuple keys/values with integer seconds, realistic supply-chain estimates (e.g., long procurement/shipping delays with high variance, short internal steps with low variance, accumulating averages/std devs for multi-step pairs), comprehensive representative subset (28 pairs spanning direct/skip/long-range across all 10 activities, demonstrating complexity without excess), and consistent logical structure (e.g., SS->RC avg exactly sums direct predecessors; std devs scale empirically). No errors, ambiguities, or deviations.
