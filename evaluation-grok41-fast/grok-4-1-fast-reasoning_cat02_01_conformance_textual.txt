**10.0**

The answer is exemplary: fully accurate identification of violating cases (2, 3, 5) with no misses or false positives; precise, textual references to the description without misquotes or overinterpretation; clear sequencing visualizations; logical violation breakdowns tied to explicit/implied constraints (e.g., path exclusivity, strict ordering like Authorize before Package, no Ship post-Cancel or sans-Package); ambiguities resolved conservatively and justifiably (e.g., Authorize-then-Cancel as illogical path mix); no extraneous claims, unclarities, or flaws; concise summary reinforces without redundancy. Hypercritical review finds zero inaccuracies, even minor (e.g., all sequences verbatim from log; every bullet evidence-based).
