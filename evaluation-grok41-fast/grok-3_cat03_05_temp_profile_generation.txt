**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**:
  - Perfect format: Valid Python dictionary with correct tuple keys (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`) and value structure `(average_time, standard_deviation)`. Times in seconds, realistic conversions (e.g., 86400 = 1 day).
  - Valid pairs: All 16 pairs respect the implied linear order (SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS). Includes all 9 direct successor pairs + 7 multi-step pairs for good complexity/representation as required ("representative subset" with "pairs separated by multiple steps").
  - Realistic estimates: Times scale logically with distance (short for direct ~hours-days, long for multi ~days-weeks); std devs ~15-33% of avg, larger for longer spans (good variability modeling). Comments per pair add clarity.
  - Comprehensive response: Intro contextualizes, code block clean, explanation covers estimation logic, units, variability factors, and subset rationale. Aligns with supply chain realism (e.g., supplier lead ~7 days).
  - No violations: No invalid pairs, negative/zero values, syntax errors, or extraneous content.

- **Weaknesses (strict deductions, totaling -1.8)**:
  - **Logical flaw in average times (major, -1.0)**: Multi-step avgs must equal sum of intermediate direct avgs (E[T_{AC}] = E[T_{AB}] + E[T_{BC}] always holds for sequential traces). 4/7 multi-step pairs fail:
    | Pair | Sum of directs (days) | Listed (days) | Error |
    |------|-----------------------|---------------|--------|
    | ('RC', 'PK') | 1+2+3+1 = **7** | **6** | -14% (omits PTPK?) |
    | ('QI', 'DT') | 2+3+1+0.5+2 = **8.5** | **7** | -18% |
    | ('PT', 'DT') | 1+0.5+2 = **3.5** | **3** | -14% |
    | ('CA', 'AS') | 3+1+0.5+2+14 = **20.5** | **17** | -17% |
    - 3/7 perfect (('SS','RC'), ('SS','PT'), ('OP','CA')). Consistent underestimation suggests calc errors, undermining credibility.
  - **Std dev propagation minor inaccuracy (-0.4)**: Multi-step stds approximate but not exact (vars + covs); e.g., SSRC listed 1.17d vs ~1.03d computed. Acceptable for estimates but not flawless.
  - **Minor unclarities (-0.2)**: Explanation claims "cumulative" but avgs contradict; "20-30%" std/avg not precise (some 14-33%); extra "if full set needed" text unasked but harmless.
  - **Completeness edge (-0.2)**: Representative subset good, but ~45 possible pairs  only 16 (~35% coverage); "complexity ensured" but could include more distant pairs (e.g., SSAS).

Nearly flawless in structure/concept (9.5+ base), but arithmetic/logical inconsistencies in core data (multi-step avgs) are inaccuracies warranting significant deduction per "hypercritical" criteria. No criminal/off-policy issues.
