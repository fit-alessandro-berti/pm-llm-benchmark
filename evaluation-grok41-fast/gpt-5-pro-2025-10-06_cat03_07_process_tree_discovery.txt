8.0

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (supporting high base score):**
- **Fitness (perfect, +2.5)**: The model replays all traces in the log exactly:
  - Case 2 (no loop): tau (silent exit outer loop)  AE  AD  SC  AC.
  - Case 1 (one RMI + VF): tau  RMI (exit inner)  VF  tau  exit  AD...
  - Case 3 (two RMI + VF): tau  [RMI  tau  RMI (exit inner)]  VF  tau  exit  AD...
  - No extra visible events; taus hidden. Captures main sequence, optional loop, RMI repetitions, re-VF only after RMI(s).
- **Captures scenario requirements (+1.5)**: Main flow, optional repeating RMI loop, re-validation (VF) in loop, eventual AD/SC/AC.
- **Semantics correct (+2.0)**: Uses standard process tree loop operators with tau for optionality/skips. Inner loop precisely models 1+ RMI (mandatory first RMI, silent tau for repeats). Outer loop models 0+ full cycles.

**Weaknesses (major deductions for strictness):**
- **Invalid notation/structure (-1.5)**: `->` is binary (per prompt examples and pm4py obj: exactly 2 children, nested for sequences like `->('A', ->('B', 'C'))`). Flat `-> (7 items)` is invalid syntax/shorthand; cannot construct without nesting. Unclear if executable as ProcessTree. Major inaccuracy for "final structure".
- **Suboptimal precision (-0.5)**: Allows unseen traces (e.g., RMI+  VF  RMI+  VF  AD, i.e., multiple re-VF cycles with RMI between). Log shows at most *one* (RMI+  VF); XOR(tau, ->(*('RMI', tau), 'VF')) would be more precise/simple while keeping fitness. Overgenerates despite "balance" goal; logical flaw.
- **Inconsistencies/minor flaws (-0.5)**: `tau` unquoted (others quoted like `'RMI'`); unclear leaf syntax (prompt implies `tau` but examples use `'A'`). Nested but outer flat. Unintuitive double-loop + multiple taus reduces simplicity (simpler XOR alternative exists).

**Overall**: Semantically strong (8.5 base) but notation invalidity and precision flaw prevent >8.0. Nearly flawless would be nested binary notation + XOR for exact 0/1 cycle (9.5-10). Hypercritical: syntax error alone drops ~2 points; overgeneration another ~1.
