**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. Both queries precisely achieve the required outcome: they correctly group by `case_id`, filter cases to those with `COUNT(*) <= 6` (accurately excluding >6 events), and return the full set of events (`*` or `e.*`) for qualifying cases only, with no extraneous rows, incorrect filtering, or logical flaws. 

- **Accuracy**: No errors in SQL semantics; both CTE/JOIN and window function approaches are logically sound, produce identical results, and handle the "full set of events" requirement perfectly. Works in DuckDB as standard SQL.
- **Efficiency note**: Correctly identifies CTE as generally more efficient (avoids redundant counting per row).
- **Clarity**: Well-commented, explained step-by-step, and provides an alternative without redundancy. Ordering is optional but enhances usability without altering results.
- **Completeness**: Addresses all prompt elements (grouping, filtering, returning full events) without assumptions beyond specified columns.
- **No issues**: No syntax errors, ambiguities, over/under-filtering, performance fallacies, or unnecessary complexity. Minor nitpicks (e.g., unqualified ORDER BY columns in window query) are non-issues as `SELECT *` preserves them unambiguously.

No deductions warranted; this exceeds "a" query by providing robust, explained options.
