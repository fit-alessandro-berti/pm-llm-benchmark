**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is strong in structure, clarity of presentation (e.g., tables, verdicts), and coverage of most key points, with good use of timelines and impacts. It addresses all three task elements (normative violations, desiderata, justifications). However, under utmost strictness, multiple inaccuracies, logical flaws, structural issues, and unclarities prevent a "nearly flawless" score (9.0+). Each flaw docks points significantly:

#### Major Deductions (-2.0 total):
1. **Missed Normative Violation in Case 2 (Part 1)**: Fails to explicitly identify the **missing "Inform Applicant"** as a normative violation in Case 2's Part 1 analysis or verdict (lists only 2 violations). The rules mandate "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome" *after* decision and *before* conditionals like finalize/close. Log confirms absence. Noted later in Part 2 (correctly flagged as normative), but structural misplacement violates task separation (Part 1 = normative only). This is a critical omission of a clear sequence skip.
   
2. **Calculation Error in Case 3 (Part 2)**: Inform Applicant delay wrongly stated as "78.25 hours" (from 2024-01-14 12:00 to 2024-01-16 15:00 = **exactly 51 hours**: 2 full days = 48h + 3h). Inflated figure misrepresents severity (~1.06x over 48h vs. claimed ~1.6x) and undermines quantitative precision. 49h for Credit Check is correct, but paired error shows sloppy verification.

#### Medium Deductions (-1.0 total):
3. **Logical/Table Inconsistency in Case 2 Desiderata**: Credit Check timing marked "**Failed**" but details contradict ("20 minutes after application — *actually MEETS this*"). Actual: ~100min (08:00 to 09:00), still <24h and meets, but "Failed" label + asterisk creates confusion/illogical formatting. Unclear intent (typo? hedge?).

4. **Misplacement of Normative Issue in Desiderata**: Case 2's missing Inform Applicant listed under Part 2 table ("No record"), despite answer self-correcting it as "**normative requirement**". Blurs task boundaries; should be excluded from desiderata entirely.

#### Minor Deductions (-0.5 total, but strict docking):
5. **Phrasing Leakage in Part 1**: Case 3 labeled "COMPLIANT (with timing concerns)" — injects desiderata into normative section, despite correct verdict. Subtle but violates strict separation.
   
6. **Incomplete Task 3 Coverage**: Justifications provided only for Case 3 (good examples: backlog, weekends). Minimal/none for Case 1 (e.g., why no follow-up?) or Case 2 (e.g., possible data logging error for order/Inform?). Task says "when possible"; more could have been done without speculation.

#### Strengths (Supporting 7.0 Base):
- Accurate on core Case 2 violations (Risk before Credit; Finalize after reject).
- Case 1/3 normative flawless.
- Desiderata mostly precise (e.g., Case 3 timings directionally correct, follow-up handling good).
- Extras like summary table, severity ratings, recommendations add value without harm.
- Clear, professional format enhances readability.

**Overall**: Competent and comprehensive (~80% flawless), but flaws are not "minor" — they include omissions of required analysis, factual errors, and inconsistencies that could mislead. 7.0 reflects high competence with significant room for precision. A flawless version would fix all, fully separate sections, and maximize justifications: 9.5–10.0.
