**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Major Inaccuracy in Task 1 (Fatal Flaw, -5+ points)**: The proposed trace (`Receive_Order Check_Inventory Authorize_Payment Cancel_Order Close_Order`) is **NOT accepted by the model**. Process tree semantics strictly require:
  - XOR executes **exactly one child completely**.
  - PARALLEL requires **all children** (Authorize_Payment **+** Package_Items **+** Ship_Order, interleaved).
  This trace mixes partial PARALLEL (only Authorize_Payment, missing Package_Items/Ship_Order) with Cancel_Order (from other XOR child), violating both operators. Model rejects it outright (no valid path generates it). Claiming acceptance is a **fundamental logical error**; no "partial execution" or "switching" is allowed. This alone warrants near-minimal score.
  
- **Major Inaccuracy in Task 2 (Compounding Flaw, -2 points)**: Explanation of "why model allows it" is **entirely wrong** (invokes non-existent "partial execution" and "interleaving across XOR"). Correct model behavior is misrepresented. Domain explanation is solid (mutual exclusivity), but ties to incorrect trace/model analysis.

- **Minor Unclarities/Redundancy (-0.5 points)**: Trace repeated verbatim ("or more generally"); unnecessary verbosity.

- **Unrequested Additions (-0.5 points)**: "Recommended Fix" and "Conclusion" exceed task (identify trace + explain); distracts without adding value.

- **Partial Credit (+1 point)**: Strong domain knowledge (correctly flags mutual exclusivity, path logic). Well-structured format.

**Overall**: Not "nearly flawless"—core tasks failed due to misreading model semantics. Equivalent to solving wrong problem. Under utmost strictness, low score despite polish. Real examples model accepts but shouldn't: e.g., `Receive_Order Check_Inventory Cancel_Order Close_Order Close_Order` (duplicate Close_Order illogical); or `Receive_Order Check_Inventory Ship_Order Authorize_Payment Package_Items Close_Order` (ships before payment).
