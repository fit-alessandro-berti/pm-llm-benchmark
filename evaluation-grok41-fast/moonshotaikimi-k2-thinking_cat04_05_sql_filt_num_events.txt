The primary query is precisely correct, standard SQL, efficient, portable, returns exactly all original columns/events as required ("full set of events"), correctly groups by `case_id` with `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to filter cases with six or fewer events, and uses a clean `IN` subquery to retain only qualifying events. The alternative window function query is also fully correct for DuckDB, leverages columnar efficiency, properly excludes the auxiliary column, and matches requirements. The explanation is accurate, concise, and directly addresses the logic without flaws, ambiguities, or extras. No inaccuracies, logical issues, or deviations from the prompt.
