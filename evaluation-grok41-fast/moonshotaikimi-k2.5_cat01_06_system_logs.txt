**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**:
  - **Format and Completeness**: Excellent markdown table with required attributes (Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp) plus useful extras (Application, Resource, Additional Attributes). All 26 original events are accounted for in spirit (covered, abstracted).
  - **Case Identification**: Artifact-centric logic is sophisticated and coherent, correctly inferring Document1 as interrupted main task (with suspend/resume), separate micro-cases for email/PDF/Excel, and Quarterly spanning start/end. Creates analyst-friendly narratives (e.g., research loop visible in DOC-001).
  - **Activity Naming**: Strong abstraction—low-level (FOCUS"Open Document", TYPINGcontextual "Draft Introduction"/"Update Financial Data", SAVE"Save Document", etc.). Standardized yet descriptive, avoiding raw verbs. Specifics from "Keys" enhance without spaghetti (few unique activities).
  - **Coherent Narrative**: Tells a clear multi-tasking story (Document1 research interruption chain, Quarterly bookends).
  - **Explanation**: Concise, structured, directly addresses objectives (artifact strategy, interruptions, naming hierarchy, temporality). Brief yet comprehensive.

- **Fatal Flaws (significant deductions)**:
  - **Event Duplication/Inaccuracy (major: -2.0)**: 29 output rows > 26 input events. SWITCH events (09:01:45, 09:04:00, 09:06:00) are **split into two rows each** (one in leaving case as "Suspend...", one in entering case at **identical timestamp**). This invents 3 extra events, violating 1:1 transformation fidelity. E.g., single SWITCH 09:01:45 becomes DOC-001 "Suspend for Research" **and** EMAIL-001 "Access Inbox"—unfaithful augmentation, risks misleading process discovery (duplicate timestamps inflate concurrency falsely).
  - **Logical Inconsistency (moderate: -0.5)**: Explanation claims "SWITCH events assigned to case being *left*", but table contradicts (also used for entering cases). PDFExcel transition correctly implicit (no dupe), but pattern inconsistent.
  - **Minor Unclarities/Assumptions (-0.3)**: Resource="User" invented (not in log, though useful). Some Additional Attributes rephrase raw (good) but "ContentType: Additional details" truncates "Additional details here" imprecisely. No handling for SCROLL Direction as full attribute consistently.

Nearly flawless structure/logic elevates from low score, but duplication is a core transformation inaccuracy—strictly penalized as "not suitable for standard tools" without cleaning (e.g., ProM/Disco would import dupes as separate events). 10.0 requires zero invention/mapping errors.
