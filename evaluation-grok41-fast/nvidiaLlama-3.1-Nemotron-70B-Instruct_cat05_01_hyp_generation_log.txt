**7.2**

### Strengths (Supporting Higher Score)
- **Anomaly Identification**: Excellently covers all four cases with precise, relevant deviations (out-of-sequence in 1002/1003, missing steps, advance payment in 1004, credit variability). Accurately ties to normal flow. No major misses (e.g., notes shipment despite `shipment_scheduled=N` implicitly via sequence).
- **Hypotheses**: Plausible and aligned (e.g., miscommunication/policy violations/system errors for sequences; advance payment as promo/error). Varied causes hypothesized without speculation.
- **SQL Coverage**: Uses `order_event_log` primarily, joins `orders` appropriately (payment query). Proposes case-specific + general follow-ups. Credit parsing with `SPLIT_PART`/`CAST` is clever/accurate. Payment query logic sound (correlated subquery correct). Credit aggregate query complex but functional (CTE handles parsing/join/counts properly; detects shipment existence).
- **Structure**: Clear, numbered, actionable. Extra recommendations harmless/extra credit.

### Critical Flaws (Deductions for Strictness)
- **Invalid SQL (Major: -1.5)**: Anomaly 1 follow-up LAG query references `previous_activity` (window alias) directly in `WHERE`—invalid in PostgreSQL (window funcs post-WHERE; errors at runtime). Requires CTE/subquery. Unrunnable, fails "relevant SQL" criterion.
- **Wrong Logic (Major: -1.0)**: Anomaly 2 completeness query uses `BOOL_AND(activity IN (...))`—detects *extra* non-standard activities (none exist), not *missing* ones. Returns no incompletes or all cases TRUE. Fundamentally fails hypothesis test (incomplete sequences). Needs `COUNT(DISTINCT activity) = 7` or `array_agg` check.
- **Trivial Queries (Minor: -0.3)**: Three "SELECT * FROM ... WHERE case_id = X ORDER BY timestamp"—restate given data, not "investigate further." Unnecessary; wastes investigative value.
- **Unclear/Imprecise (Minor: -0.2)**: Anomaly 4 simple query's `shipped` subquery returns string `'Ship Goods'` or NULL (not boolean); misnamed/misleading. Credit hypothesis ("lower scores correlate with delayed/cancelled") loose—data shows 650/720 shipped despite issues, no delays quantified.
- **Missed Opportunities (Minor: -0.1)**: No `resources` joins (e.g., role/dept for skips); no `orders` for value/type correlation (e.g., priority 1002 skips). Credit query excludes 1004 (no check—intentional but unnoted). No timestamp diffs for delays.
- **Overreach (Negligible: -0.1)**: Unasked recommendations inflate but don't harm.

Nearly strong (8+ potential), but SQL errors/logic bugs are non-flawless/unrunnable, mandating deduction under "hypercritical" rules. Balanced at 7.2 for comprehensive coverage despite issues.
