**2.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Format (Major Failure, -3)**: Not a single cohesive Markdown table as required. Fragmented into incomplete, header-less blocks. Invalid table structure (e.g., repeated timestamps in "Other Attributes" redundantly/uselessly; malformed rows).
- **Completeness (Major Failure, -3)**: Misses vast majority of events. E.g., no dispatch/arrival for 1001, 1003 (actual data exists); no invoice/payment for 1001,1003,1004; ignores 1004 entirely post-picking despite picking data; fabricates extras (e.g., multiple bogus dispatches for 1004/1005). Not "every event for every order_id included."
- **Accuracy & Linking (Catastrophic Failure, -3)**: Gross errors in data mapping. E.g., assigns 1002/1003 invoices/payments to 1004/1005; uses arrival dates for "Dispatched"; ignores invoice_id/payment_id chains; no carrier resources from Delivery; wrong timestamps (e.g., 1004 dispatch dates invented/non-existent). No proper multi-shipment handling (e.g., 1002 has 2 deliveries  4 events: 2 dispatch + 2 arrive).
- **Chronology (Major Failure, -1)**: No per-case sorting or sequence. Events jumbled by activity type, violating "chronological order reflects real process flow" (e.g., pickings after creations OK but dispatches before pickings in some cases; payments before invoices).
- **Activities & Enrichment (Partial but Flawed, -1)**: "Order Created" and "Items Picked" partially correct (per-line events good), but misses sales_person_id resource; ignores "Order Dispatched"/"Order Arrived" properly; no payment events linked correctly; no use of optional Products/Resources tables for enrichment.
- **Assumptions/Documentation (Failure, -0.5)**: Zero documentation despite ambiguities (e.g., no delivery for 1004; multi-invoice handling). Invents data without basis.
- **Minor Polish (-0.5)**: Unclear/inconsistent resources (e.g., payments as "CC"/"W"); no descriptive activity variations (e.g., per-shipment notes).

Partial credit only for ~20% correct rows (created/picked) and attempting columns. Overall: Fundamentally unusable for process mining due to errors/logical flaws. Only not 1.0 as it identifies core cases/activities partially.
