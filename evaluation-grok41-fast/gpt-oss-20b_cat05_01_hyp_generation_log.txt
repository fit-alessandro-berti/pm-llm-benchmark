**2.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Critical Flaw 1: Missing Essential Data (Fatal Omission)**: The prompt references "the provided example rows" but includes **zero** event log data (no tables for case_ids 1001–1004), orders sample rows, or resources sample rows. The target LLM cannot "scan the event sequences per case (`case_id`)" or detect anomalies without this data. This renders the prompt unusable for its core purpose, violating the requirement to provide the "given event log" context from the schema/data description.
- **Critical Flaw 2: Explicit Hints at Anomalies (Direct Violation)**: States "deviations such as missing steps, outofsequence events, duplicate activities, early shipments before credit checks, etc." This spoon-feeds the exact anomalies (e.g., 1002's early Confirm Shipment, 1003's skipped Validate Stock, 1004's premature Receive Payment), contradicting "without any hints or guidance provided here." The target LLM is not encouraged to independently identify them.
- **Major Flaw 3: Incomplete Schema Presentation**: Table summary lists "Key Columns" but omits full details (e.g., data types like INTEGER, TIMESTAMP, DECIMAL; full column lists match but lack precision). No sample data from `orders`/`resources` for context on order_value, roles, etc., needed for hypotheses involving value, departments.
- **Minor Flaws (Compounding Downgrades)**: Unnecessary emojis (1–7) clutter professionally; odd formatting (non-breaking hyphens, table spacing); assumes data exists without providing it; "Do not provide any additional explanations" is good but undermined by hints.
- **Positives (Minimal Credit)**: Tasks match exactly (detect, hypothesize, propose SQL). Structure is clear. Mentions PostgreSQL, joins tables. Concise intro.

**Nearly flawless requires**: Full data tables, schema verbatim, normal flow only (no anomaly spoilers), precise instructions sans hints. This is ~80% incomplete/wrong, justifying low score under "utmost strictness" and "minor issues significantly lower."
