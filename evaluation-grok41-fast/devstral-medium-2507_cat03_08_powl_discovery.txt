**3.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation:
- **Major structural inaccuracies (fatal flaws, -4.0 penalty)**: The `loop_IQC_AS = *(IQC, AS)` is fundamentally mismatched to the traces. LOOP semantics execute A (IQC) first, then optionally B (AS)  A again, always exiting after A (IQC). Traces show: (1) initial AS *before* any IQC (e.g., all cases: QS  AS  ...); (2) exit to TST *after* AS, not IQC (e.g., case 1: IQC  AS  TST); (3) no way to skip entirely (case 4: QS  AS  TST, no IQC); (4) cannot produce consecutive IQCs (case 3: AS  IQC  IQC  ...). No trace starts IQC immediately after QS. Model forces unwanted IQC after QS and prevents case 4.
- **Missing initial AS (-1.5)**: No standalone AS after QS; all AS buried incorrectly in flawed loop. Cases always have 1 AS post-QS, extras only with IQC.
- **StrictPartialOrder enforces invalid sequence (-1.0)**: QS  loop_IQC_AS  loop_TST_RT requires completing loop_IQC_AS (at least IQC) before TST, blocking case 4 skip.
- **Partial correctness (+1.0 credit)**: `loop_TST_RT = *(TST, RT)` perfectly captures testing (starts TST, exits after TST, optional RT  TST repeats; matches all cases). `xor_LB` correctly optionals LB (case 2 skips). High-level chain (ORMSQS...PKxor_LBDPD) aligns with sequencing. No spurious concurrency.
- **Minor code/pedantic issues (-0.5)**: Standalone `AS` defined but unused outside loop (redundant). Explanation claims "captures complex relationships" but glosses inaccuracies (e.g., doesn't address skips or IQC-IQC).
- **Overall**: Captures ~30% accurately (testing, LB, skeleton); rest logically invalid vs. traces. Not "nearly flawless"—core process (QSAS/IQCTST) broken. Equivalent to a rough sketch with critical errors.
