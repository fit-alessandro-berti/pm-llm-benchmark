**4.0**

### Justification (hypercritical evaluation):
- **Major logical flaw (fitness failure, -4+ points)**: The model cannot reproduce the observed trace in Case 3 (AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD), as the LOOP(tau, SEQUENCE(RMI, VF)) semantics force a VF after *every* RMI iteration (e.g., one iteration: RMIVF; two iterations: RMIVFRMIVF). Consecutive RMI without intervening VF is impossible, directly contradicting the log's "repetitions of requesting missing info" (two RMI in succession before single re-validation VF). This makes fitness incomplete (~66% trace replayability: perfect for Cases 1-2, zero for Case 3).
- **Precision issues (-1 point)**: Allows unobserved traces like RMIVFRMIVFAD (overgeneralizes repetitions as paired RMI-VF blocks, reducing precision).
- **Inaccuracy in comment (-0.5 point)**: "silent 'body' – lets the loop be skipped completely" mislabels tau as the "body" (per definition, tau is the mandatory initial *A*; B=SEQUENCE(RMI,VF) is the loop body). Misleads on semantics.
- **Minor syntactic unclarity (-0.5 point)**: "tau" lacks quotes (cf. prompt's `'A'` or "tau" for leaves); inconsistent with quoted labels like `'Receive Application (RA)'`. Flat SEQUENCE list assumes n-ary (valid per pm4py), but prompt notation prefers binary nesting like `->(A, ->(B, C))` for clarity.
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Captures main sequence (RAVFAE[opt]ADSCAC), optional skip (tauexit fits Case 2), single RMI+VF (Case 1), simplicity. Balances somewhat but fails "capturing these possible repetitions" strictly.

Nearly flawless requires 100% log fitness + high precision/simplicity with zero errors; this has critical semantic mismatch.
