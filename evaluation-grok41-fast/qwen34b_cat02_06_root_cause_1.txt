**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: Excellent structure mirroring the task's 3 parts. Accurate duration calculations for all cases (e.g., 25h10m, 49h5m, average 20.4h precise). Clear tables/sections, insightful breakdowns of timelines for identified cases, logical linking of escalations to delays (correct for 102/105), and practical, actionable recommendations (e.g., SLAs, automation). Conclusions are concise and tied back to insights. No unclarities in language; professional tone.
  
- **Major Flaws (significant deductions)**:
  - **Inaccuracy in Task 1 (critical)**: Missed Case 104 (24h10m > average 20.4h) as "significantly longer." This is 18% above average, nearly identical to Case 102 (23% above), yet excluded. Task specifies "compared to others" and "significantly longer than average"—104 qualifies (spans days like 102, unlike sub-3h cases 101/103). Incomplete identification undermines entire analysis (only 2/3 long cases covered). -1.5 points.
  - **Logical flaw in Task 2 (major)**: Root causes overemphasize "escalations" as primary/common factor ("both cases involve escalations"; "outliers due to escalations"). Ignores Case 104's long duration **without** escalation—reveals L1 bottlenecks (e.g., 3.5h assign-to-investigate wait vs. 10-40min in quick cases). Misses broader patterns like post-assignment delays (2.5-3.5h in long cases) or overnight waits (19-25h inv-to-resolve across 102/104/105). Analysis incomplete/non-comprehensive. -1.0 point.
  - **Minor issues (further deductions)**: Task 3 recommendations escalation-focused (e.g., "escalation process," L2 training), neglecting L1 delays evident in 104 (e.g., no rec for L1 queue management). "Critical delay" for 102's escalation timing unsubstantiated (L1 may have needed 2.5h to decide). Average pulled high by long cases but not flagged as skewed metric. -0.3 points.

- **Overall**: Strong execution (8.5+ potential) derailed by core inaccuracy (missed case) and resulting logical gaps. Not "nearly flawless"—feels 70% complete. 7.2 reflects strict calibration: solid but critically flawed.
