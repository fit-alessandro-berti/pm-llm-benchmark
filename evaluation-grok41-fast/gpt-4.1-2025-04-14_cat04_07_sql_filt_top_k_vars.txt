The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. The SQL query precisely fulfills all requirements:

- Correctly constructs per-case sequences using `string_agg(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp)`, ensuring timestamp-ordered variants (minor note: timestamp ties yield arbitrary sub-order per SQL semantics, but the prompt defines order solely by timestamp without mandating tiebreakers or unique IDs, so this matches exactly; no deduction warranted).
- Groups/counts cases by exact sequence string for variants and frequencies.
- Identifies top-K via `ORDER BY num_cases DESC LIMIT {{K}}` (standard interpretation; ties handled deterministically by sort/LIMIT as noted, aligning with unspecified tiebreaker behavior).
- Filters to exact case_ids of top-K variants via JOIN, excluding others.
- Returns full original events (`SELECT e.*`) only for those cases.

Query is efficient, DuckDB-compatible (e.g., `string_agg` with `ORDER BY` supported), self-documenting with CTEs/steps, and uses templated `{{K}}` appropriately (prompt implies parameterization without specifying syntax). Ancillary text clarifies without inaccuracy or bloat. No logical flaws, ambiguities, inefficiencies, or deviations.
