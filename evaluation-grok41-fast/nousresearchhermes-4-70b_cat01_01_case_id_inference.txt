The final answer is flawless: it correctly identifies and groups all 18 events into exactly three cases without omissions, overlaps, or misassignments, matching patient demographics (unique age/gender combos), timestamps (sequential per case), activities (logical medical flows: registration  triage/tests  consultation  treatment  discharge), and departments (ER cases use supporting Radiology/Lab; Surgery case stays isolated). Event lists are exhaustive and precise, descriptions accurately reflect `additional_info`, and key observations succinctly justify the inference criteria without errors, ambiguities, or extraneous details. Structure is clear and comprehensive.
