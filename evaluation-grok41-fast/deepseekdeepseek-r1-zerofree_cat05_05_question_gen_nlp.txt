The provided answer is a flawless execution of the prompt. It delivers exactly 20 open-ended, thought-provoking questions directly derived from the described supply chain process. Each question precisely targets insights (e.g., #8 on model effectiveness, #19 on KPIs), potential issues (e.g., #6 on transportation challenges, #18 on disruptions), improvement strategies (e.g., #14 on continuous initiatives, #15 on currency management), and decision implications (e.g., #5 on customs impacts, #7 on balancing replenishment strategies). No SQL queries, no extraneous text in the final list—just the numbered questions as required. All are clear, logically sound, relevant, and free of inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws.
