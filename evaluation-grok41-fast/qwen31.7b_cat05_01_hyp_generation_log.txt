**5.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Strict Evaluation)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies **one key anomaly** in case 1004 (Receive Payment before Confirm Shipment), with accurate description matching timestamps and process flow. Hypothesis is reasonable (data entry/system error). Queries 1-3 are **syntactically valid PostgreSQL**, logically sound for the identified anomaly, and use correlated subqueries effectively to compare timestamps per `case_id`. Structure is clear and professional.
- **Critical Flaws (major deductions)**:
  - **Incomplete anomaly identification**: Ignores **multiple obvious anomalies** across cases, e.g.:
    | Case | Missed Anomalies |
    |------|------------------|
    | 1002 | Confirm Shipment/Ship Goods **before** Credit Check/Validate Stock (skipped approval); all activities present but severely out-of-order. |
    | 1003 | **Missing** Validate Stock entirely; Ship Goods **before** Confirm Shipment; Confirm Shipment **after** Issue Invoice/Receive Payment (rework/skip). |
    | 1004 | **Missing** Credit Check/Validate Stock; Receive Payment **before** Issue Invoice; Ship Goods despite `shipment_scheduled=N`. |
    This is not "nearly flawless"—it's superficial, focusing only on one timestamp pair while overlooking skips, missing events, and broader sequence violations (core to process mining).
  - **Flawed Query 4**: Does **not** identify missing events. Hardcodes `case_id = 1001` (normal case), so `NOT IN` excludes only its `event_id`s (1-7), returning **irrelevant results** (e.g., all events from 1002+). Logically broken; fails stated purpose. No proper missing-event query (e.g., `GROUP BY case_id` with `COUNT(DISTINCT activity)` vs. expected 7).
  - **Unclarities/Logical Gaps**: No hypotheses/queries for missed anomalies (e.g., no check for activity presence per case, wrong-department resources, or `additional_info` flags like `shipment_scheduled=N`). Query 3 is redundant/inverse of 1-2 without adding value. No joins to `orders`/`resources` despite schema (e.g., check priority orders skipping steps?). "Primary issue" claim downplays unaddressed problems.
  - **Strictness Penalty**: Per instructions, incompleteness (missed ~70% of deviations), broken query, and lack of comprehensiveness = significant deduction. Not hyper-focused or exhaustive; feels narrow despite data screaming for more.

A 10.0 requires **exhaustive, flawless anomaly detection + perfectly targeted, error-free queries** covering all deviations. This is middling at best.
