**8.0**

### Rationale for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**:
  - **Format and syntax**: Perfect Python dictionary. Keys are correct tuples (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`), values are tuples of positive integers `(avg, std)` with `avg > std > 0`. No syntax errors, no extras, directly assigns to `temporal_profile`.
  - **Content volume and complexity**: 38/45 possible forward pairs in the linear order (SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS), fulfilling "representative subset" with multi-step pairs (e.g., `('SS', 'AS')` ~60 days, `('QI', 'DT')`). Covers direct, mid-range, and long-range pairs effectively.
  - **Realism and estimation quality**: Times in seconds are plausible for supply chain (e.g., OPRC ~8 days lead time, RCQI ~6 hours inspection, DTAS ~30 days post-sale). **Additivity is excellent** (e.g., SSOP 2d + OPRC 8d  SSRC 10d; variances accumulate roughly via std ~0.3-0.5×avg).
  - **Logical order**: All pairs respect sequence (earlier  later); no reverses or invalid combinations.

- **Flaws (deducting 2.0 points, preventing 10.0)**:
  - **Inconsistent/incomplete subset selection (major logical flaw)**: Misses 7 pairs illogically, despite "eventually following" in linear process:
    | Missing | Reason for Issue |
    |---------|------------------|
    | `('SS', 'PK')`, `('SS', 'WS')` | Skips PK/WS despite including later DT/AS from SS (path requires PKWSDT). |
    | `('OP', 'WS')`, `('RC', 'WS')`, `('QI', 'WS')` | Systematically omits WS from pre-CA starters despite including PK/DT/AS (path PKWSDT). |
    | `('QI', 'AS')`, `('CA', 'AS')` | Omits AS from QI/CA despite including from PT+ (path ...PT...AS). |
    This creates non-representative gaps—e.g., QIDT but not QIWS (WS on path); CADT but not CAAS. Arbitrary, undermining "eventually follow each other."
  - **Minor unclarities**: No justification for skips (e.g., implying WS optional despite description's sequential "involves [...] activities"). Times not *exactly* additive in all chains (e.g., CADT 5d vs. CAPT 0.5d + PTDT 3d = 3.5d; ~30% overestimation, acceptable but not flawless).
  
Nearly flawless execution/estimates, but selection inconsistencies are logical inaccuracies warranting deduction. 10.0 requires zero gaps or explicit rationale; 8.0 reflects strong but imperfect compliance.
