**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (Supporting High Base Score):**
- **Anomaly Identification (Near-Flawless, 9.5/10):** Precisely pinpoints all key deviations across cases 1002–1004 (out-of-order shipments/credit checks, missing "Validate Stock", reversed payment-invoice, post-shipment confirmation with `shipment_scheduled=N`). Correctly excludes normal case 1001. Ties to data specifics like timestamps/additional_info without hallucination.
- **Hypotheses (Strong, 9/10):** Logical, data-grounded (e.g., priority/high-value correlations, system errors, bypasses). Covers process, human, and technical causes without overreach.
- **Structure and Coverage:** Concise final output despite verbose <think>. Includes insights/actions as value-add. Queries target hypotheses (sequence violations, missings, resources, timings).

**Major Deductions (Strict Penalties for Flaws):**
- **SQL Query Accuracy/Generality (6/10, -1.5 Overall):** 
  - **Q1:** Specific to hardcoded pairs (e.g., misses RegisterConfirm jump in 1002; only catches post-Ship anomalies). LAG works but not general out-of-order detector (e.g., no step numbering for full sequence validation). Purpose overstated.
  - **Q2:** Implicitly assumes *all* log activities are "required" via DISTINCT (works here but fragile/non-explicit; fails if extras/logs change). CROSS JOIN inefficient; better explicit expected list.
  - **Q3:** Solid (general, correct MAX for timestamps, joins `orders`).
  - **Q4:** **Major flaw**—hardcodes `case_id IN (1002,1003,1004)` (data-peeking, not general hypothesis tester). Violates "propose relevant SQL...to investigate further" (assumes known anomalies).
  - **Q5:** **Critical SQL bug**—self-JOIN on `ed.timestamp = ed_next.timestamp` creates tautology (matches only same row); `ed_next.next_timestamp` references undefined LEAD-of-LEAD. WHERE logic sound in intent but query fails execution. Minutes_gap computation broken.
- **Completeness/Clarity (7.5/10, -0.5):** No query for resource correlations beyond hardcoded Q4 (e.g., department patterns in anomalies). Q1/Q2 miss full step-order checks (e.g., LAG(prev_step) < step as in <think>). Minor formatting (e.g., anomaly description typos like extra spaces).
- **Logical Flaws/Unclarities (-0.3):** Insights claim "Logistics frequently involved" but Q4 doesn't prove (hardcoded); "High-value lack checks" good but unqueried generally. Actions speculative without query-backed proof.

**Final Calibration:** 7.2 reflects excellent analysis offset by SQL errors/non-generality (would be 9+ if queries flawless/general like <think>'s step-LAG). Not "nearly flawless"—bugs prevent 8+.
