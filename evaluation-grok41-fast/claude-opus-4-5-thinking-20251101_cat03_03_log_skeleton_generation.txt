**7.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
**Strengths (supporting the score):**
- **Structure and completeness**: The dictionary matches the exact format (all 6 keys present; sets of tuples for equivalence/always_before/always_after/never_together/directly_follows; dict of activityset[int] for activ_freq). All 10 scenario activities are covered in activ_freq. Code is syntactically valid Python (sets properly formed with tuples and commas; comments don't break it).
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Captures a logical sequential main flow (ROCARIPIQCPOGSLD) via before/after/directly_follows chains. Parallel financial branch (ROICRP) correctly isolated without cross-dependencies. never_together empty is appropriate (no exclusions implied). Redundancies (e.g., ('D','PO') alongside chain) are logically consistent, not errors.
- **Extras add value without harm**: Analysis, flow summary, and table clearly explain rationale, tying to scenario—shows understanding beyond raw dict.
- **Reasonable inferences**: Direct follows limited to "tight handoffs" (plausible, as scenario implies steps but not all direct). Financial track post-RO without blocking shipping is accurate.

**Fatal Flaws (major deductions: -2.0 total)**:
- **Equivalence fundamentally misused/inaccurate (-1.5)**: Definition requires "if first occurs, [count(first) == count(second)]". No scenario evidence supports equivalence *at all* (e.g., RO and D occur same count but are start/end—not equivalent; same for RO/CA, PI/QC). These are better as always_after/before (already covered redundantly). Selective one-way pairs (no reverses like ('D','RO')) make it asymmetric/incomplete vs. typical Log Skeleton equivalence (bidirectional cardinality matching). Invented constraint without basis = logical flaw, not "core activities must occur same times."
- **Redundant/overstrong with other constraints (-0.5)**: ('RO','D') duplicates always_after ('RO','D'); equivalence adds no new info but risks invalidating traces unnecessarily.

**Significant Issues (deductions: -0.6 total)**:
- **activ_freq inaccuracies (-0.4)**: QC {1,2} purely invented ("re-inspection possible"—scenario silent; no quality issues mentioned). Should be {1} like peers for strict adherence. All {1} assumes mandatory completion (reasonable inference), but RP/IC {1} glosses "once customer pays" (implies possible delay/optional, but {0,1} not considered).
- **Incomplete chain rigor (-0.2)**: always_before/after/directly_follows miss some transitives explicitly (e.g., no ('RI','RO') before, though implied), but worse: always_after lacks ('PO','D') despite always_before ('D','PO') and chain.

**Minor Issues (deductions: -0.2 total)**:
- **Unclarities**: Table rationale vague ("core activities must occur same times"—doesn't match definition). "Parallel financial track" accurate but lacks constraint like always_after('D','RP')? (no—scenario doesn't require post-D).
- **Arbitrary selections**: directly_follows omits plausible directs (e.g., ('CA','RI'), ('QC','PO')) without strong justification beyond "critical handoffs."
- **No exhaustiveness**: never_together empty ok, but no {0} bounds (e.g., RP:{0,1} if unpaid possible).

**Why not lower?** Core dict functional/correct format; 90% constraints logically sound/scenario-aligned. **Why not higher?** Equivalence invention is non-flawless (not "nearly"); QC arbitrary. 10.0 requires zero inventions, full bidirectionality, scenario-only inferences. Rescore possible if equivalence empty.
