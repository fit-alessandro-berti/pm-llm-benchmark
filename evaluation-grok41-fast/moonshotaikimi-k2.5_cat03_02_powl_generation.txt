The provided code accurately and completely constructs the POWL model matching the scenario:

- Correctly sequences SR  CS  concurrent DA/ACI  loop( BNC, D&R )  XOR( CD, MD )  concurrent QA/SA  GLA using nested StrictPartialOrder for concurrency blocks.
- Loop semantics precisely match: Operator.LOOP with children=[BNC, DR].
- XOR uses Operator.XOR with [CD, MD].
- Empty orders in sub-POs enable concurrency for DA/ACI and QA/SA.
- PO completion semantics ensure "both complete before next" (e.g., concurrent_setup  config_loop).
- Labels exactly match scenario descriptions.
- No extraneous nodes, silent transitions, or edges; structure is hierarchical and modular as per POWL definitions/examples.
- Code is syntactically valid, uses specified imports/classes, and requires no modifications.
