**9.7**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—comprehensive, precisely targeted, and fully aligned with the prompt's requirements—but deducts minor points for two small logical/scope issues under utmost strictness:

- **Strengths (driving the high score)**:
  - **Perfect adherence to core criteria**: Every question is open-ended (e.g., "What...", "How...", "Can you describe..."), targets exactly the specified areas (missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, exceptions), and stays strictly conceptual—no SQL, no implementation details, no code/tech specs.
  - **Direct mapping to description**: Questions probe every major step (e.g., Q1-2 on timeline/assignment; Q3/6/19 on docs/inspections; Q11-15 on roles; Q16-18/20 on exceptions/feedback loops) without hallucinating or straying.
  - **Structure and coverage**: Logical categorization enhances usability; covers flow (1-10), roles (11-15), exceptions (16-20), comms (21-24), and extensions like improvement (25-30) as valid "missing details" probes. Sequencing/timing verified (e.g., Q1, Q4, Q8, Q24). 30 questions form a robust "series" without excess verbosity.
  - **No inaccuracies/unclarities**: All questions are precise, non-leading, and build directly on described elements (e.g., Q7 on pricing/market trends; Q12 on comms tracking via CRMs/emails; Q17 on custom clauses).
  - **Intro/conclusion**: Helpful without fluff; reinforces goals.

- **Minor flaws (strict deductions, -0.3 total)**:
  - **Slight scope creep in Q30**: "Are there any opportunities for automation or streamlining... What steps have been taken..." subtly shifts to forward-looking suggestions/implementation hints, bordering on "implementation details" (prompt bans this). It's conceptual but less purely clarifying than others—minor logical overreach (-0.2).
  - **Compound structure in 2-3 questions**: E.g., Q1/Q5/Q11 pack 2 sub-questions each, risking interviewee overload in a real interview; not a flaw per se, but minor sequencing unclarity vs. single-focus ideal (-0.1).
  
No other issues: no redundancies (overlaps like Q3/Q19 are distinct angles), no logical gaps, no off-topic bloat. Nearly flawless; warrants top-tier score.
