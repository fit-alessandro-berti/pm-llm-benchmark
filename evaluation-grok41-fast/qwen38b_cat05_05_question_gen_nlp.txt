The response delivers precisely 20 open-ended, thought-provoking questions in a clean numbered list, with no extraneous content, SQL, or deviations. All questions directly align with the supply chain process description, probing insights (e.g., Q6, Q16 on analytics), potential issues (e.g., Q3, Q15 on disruptions), strategies for improvement (e.g., Q17, Q20 on resilience/sustainability), and decision implications (e.g., Q4, Q10, Q18 on trade-offs). Coverage spans all key stages (R&D, sourcing, assembly, logistics, distribution, compliance, after-sales) without repetition or gaps. Phrasing is clear, precise, and logically sound, with no inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws.
