**3.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Major logical flaws (deduct 4+ points):** 
  - **Coexistence misuse:** Multiple `coexistence(D, ManualReview)` for various D (e.g., `Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Female`) semantically enforces *symmetric* co-occurrence in DECLARE. Thus, *any* `ManualReview` requires *all* listed decisions (e.g., `Approve_Minority` *and* `Reject_Minority` *and* `Approve_Female`) in the same trace들mpossible and absurd for a loan process (one trace won't have mutually exclusive decisions). This renders traces unsatisfiable.
  - **Succession misuse:** `succession(CheckApplicantRace, BiasMitigationCheck)` *and* `succession(CheckApplicantRace, ManualReview)` requires every `CheckApplicantRace` to be *directly followed by both* simultaneously듧ogically impossible (only one direct successor per event). Fails to enforce intended "either/or"; violates DECLARE semantics.
  - **Nonsuccession ok but insufficient to offset.**
- **Inaccuracies in descriptions/comments/table (deduct 2+ points):**
  - Response described as "the next activity must be" (table/comment)등rong; response is *eventual* (not direct/next). Succession is direct.
  - Table claims succession enforces "must be either BiasMitigationCheck *or* ManualReview"들mpossible with listed constraints; needs `altsuccession` (available but unused).
  - Truncated/misnamed table headers (e.g., "Response (CheckBiasMitigationCheck)"), typos (e.g., "attribute checking", "biasmitigation", "cooccurs").
- **Unclarities/incompletenesses (deduct 1 point):**
  - Invents ~15 new activities (e.g., `Approve_Young`) without `existence`/`init`; assumes log but original model lacks them듮races may ignore.
  - Code notes "(add analogous pairs...)"들ncomplete dictionary.
  - Inconsistent decisions: original has `FinalDecision`; adds `Approve`/`Reject` variants without linking.
  - Overly verbose table exceeds "short explanation"; mixes rationale with errors.
- **Strengths (partial credit):** Format valid Python; preserves original; chooses relevant constraint types (precedence/response/nonsuccession good); bias intent clear (fairness checks before decisions); table structure helpful.
- **Overall:** Ambitious but critically flawed듞onstraints would reject all realistic traces, defeating bias mitigation. Not "nearly flawless"; ~30% functional.
