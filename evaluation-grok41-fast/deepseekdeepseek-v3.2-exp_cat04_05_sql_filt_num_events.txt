**9.2**

### Strengths (why not lower):
- The primary query (subquery + INNER JOIN with `el.*`) is flawless: correctly groups by `case_id`, uses `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` (precisely matching "six or fewer"), joins back to return **all columns** (`el.*`, essential for "full set of events" given "at least" those columns), and is valid DuckDB SQL.
- CTE version is also flawless: same logic, readable, `el.*` preserves all columns.
- Window function version is **functionally correct** for filtering/logic (COUNT OVER PARTITION BY works perfectly, efficient in DuckDB for medium datasets).
- Explanation is clear, structured, and educational (describes techniques accurately).
- Adds `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` (unasked but logical/useful for event logs, no harm).
- Multiple approaches demonstrate deep understanding, exceeding "craft a query" (beneficial for benchmark).

### Deductions (hypercritical flaws, preventing 10.0):
- **Major inaccuracy (window query columns, -0.5)**: SELECT explicitly lists only `case_id, activity, timestamp`, omitting other potential columns ("at least" those specified). Fails "full set of events" if table has extras (e.g., `event_id`, `resource`). Subquery/CTE use `el.*` correctly; this doesn't. Claim "all three achieve the same result" is false under prompt's schema generality.
- **Minor wording inaccuracy (-0.2)**: Explanation says "identify cases with 6 events" (implies exactly 6), but query/prompt is "<= 6" (six or fewer). Sloppy phrasing.
- **Minor overclaim (-0.1)**: "Window function approach is often the most efficient... in analytical databases like DuckDB." Subjective/unproven (DuckDB optimizes GROUP BY well too; depends on data size/indexes). Not wrong, but unsubstantiated assertion.
- No other issues: No syntax errors, handles grouping/filtering perfectly, no unnecessary complexity, DuckDB-compatible.

Nearly flawless (two main queries perfect, window 95% there), but strict criteria demand deduction for logical incompleteness and imprecise claims. A single perfect `el.*` query would be 10.0.
