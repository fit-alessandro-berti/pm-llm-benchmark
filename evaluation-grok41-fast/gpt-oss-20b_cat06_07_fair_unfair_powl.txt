**3.2**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (partial credit basis)**: The unfair model structure is conceptually sound (correct use of LOOP for data completeness, XOR for bias point, sequential PO edges matching process description; labels mostly accurate; bias explanation precise). Imports and visualization hint correct. Think reasoning (ignored per rules) shows understanding.
- **Critical Flaws Penalizing Heavily**:
  1. **Syntax Errors in Unfair Model (Major Inaccuracy)**: `Transaction(` (x3) instead of `Transition(` – code won't run, invalid Python. Line breaks/formatting in assignments (e.g., `completeness_loop =`) risk parse errors. Minor but "strictness" demands perfection.
  2. **Fair Model Completely Absent/Invalid (Fatal Logical Flaw)**: No working code delivered. "Cut off" excuses, garbled imports (`OperationPawl?`, `type?\t`, `action?`), shebang/docstring irrelevancies, refusal to provide real code ("pseudo-code instead"). Fails core task: "produce two POWL models." Second model nonexistent.
  3. **Unclarities & Structure Issues**: Rambling apologies/excuses undermine professionalism. Incomplete snippets, redundant "corrections," no final clean code blocks. Overly verbose non-code text violates "self-contained Python snippets" promise.
  4. **Minor but Penalized Issues**: Inconsistent labeling (e.g., "StandardCulturalFitEvaluation" invented vs. description's "CulturalFitCheck"); no `SilentTransition` if needed for skips (not required but example uses); no execution/validation proof.
- **Overall**: ~60% task completion (one buggy model), but strict rubric demands *nearly flawless* for high score. Equivalent to submitting half-assignment with bugs = low pass/fail. Not 10.0 (flawless), not even 5.0 (functional pair).
