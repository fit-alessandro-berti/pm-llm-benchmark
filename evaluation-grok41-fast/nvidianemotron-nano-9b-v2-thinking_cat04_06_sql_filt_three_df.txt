**10.0**

The provided SQL query is correct, complete, and precisely meets all requirements. It accurately identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence using `LEAD` window functions on ordered row numbers, correctly computes the time difference between the specific 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events in that sequence (>5 days via interval comparison, valid in DuckDB), collects distinct qualifying `case_id`s, and excludes all events from those cases via `NOT IN`. The CTE structure is efficient (avoids redundant joins by `LEAD`ing timestamps directly), syntactically valid, handles edge cases (e.g., NULL `LEAD` values prevent false matches, multiple sequences per case handled by `DISTINCT`), and returns exactly the specified result (all columns/events from non-qualifying cases, no extraneous ordering/grouping). The explanation is accurate, concise, and aligns perfectly without introducing flaws. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical issues.
