**8.0**

### Reasoning for Grade
- **Strengths (near-flawless logic and structure, warranting high base)**: The query correctly uses `LEAD(1)` and `LEAD(2)` over `PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp` to precisely detect **consecutive** events in the exact sequence with no intermediates. The time filter with `DATE_DIFF('day', ..., ... ) > 5` is appropriately placed only on the 'Create Order' to 'Confirm Order' pair. `DISTINCT case_id` handles multiple sequences per case correctly. The outer exclusion via `NOT IN` returns **all events** from non-matching cases, matching the spec exactly. Handles NULLs implicitly (filtered out). No unnecessary grouping/ordering. DuckDB syntax is idiomatic.
- **Fatal flaw (significant deduction)**: Column name inconsistency/mismatch – inner uses unquoted `case_id` (correct per prompt), but outer `WHERE` and `IN` subquery use quoted `"case_ID"` (uppercase 'ID', case-sensitive). This causes runtime errors: column `"case_ID"`/`"case_ID"` not found in `event_log` or CTE. Query fails to execute, producing no results.
- **Minor issues (further deductions)**: 
  - Redundant `::timestamp` cast on `LEAD(timestamp, NULL)` (already timestamp/NULL).
  - `::date` casts in `DATE_DIFF` slightly imprecise for "time elapsed" (truncates time-of-day; direct on timestamps better, though diff is functionally close).
  - Inconsistent quoting (`"timestamp"` quoted, `activity`/ `case_id` not; works but sloppy).
  - Encoding artifact in comment (`â€‘`); irrelevant to execution.
- **Why not lower?** Logic/approach flawless; error is obvious transcription/typo (think trace uses correct `case_id`), not conceptual. Fixes are trivial (unquote/change to `case_id`).
- **Why not 10.0/9.5?** Not "nearly flawless" – doesn't run, violates "proper ... filtering" due to syntax failure. Hypercritical: any inaccuracy (here, fatal) prevents max. 8.0 reflects excellent intent/90% correctness.
