The provided answer produces correct, complete, and faithful Python code that precisely models the described POWL scenario without inaccuracies, omissions, or logical flaws. All dependencies are enforced correctly via the root `StrictPartialOrder` and sequential edges on sub-models: SR  CS  {DA || ACI}  *(BNC, D&R)  X(CD, MD)  {QA || SA}  GLA, where `||` denotes concurrency (empty order in sub-POs) and sub-model completion requires all internal nodes to finish before downstream edges fire. Loop and XOR operators match definitions exactly. No unnecessary silent transitions. Labels exact. Imports minimal but sufficient (SilentTransition omitted as unused, per "if needed"). Structure mirrors example. Explanation accurate and concise. No clarities issues.
