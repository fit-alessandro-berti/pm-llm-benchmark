**Grade: 2.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Summary:
- **Critical structural errors (fatal)**: The `nonsuccession` dictionary has duplicate keys (e.g., multiple `"CheckApplicantRace": {...}` entries), which in Python dicts causes overwriting—only the last entry per key survives, rendering the code invalid and incomplete (e.g., no "Approve" constraint remains). This alone disqualifies it as "valid Python code."
- **Loss of original model (fatal)**: Completely overwrites existing `coexistence` (drops `StartApplication -> FinalDecision`) and `response` (drops `StartApplication -> RequestAdditionalInfo`), violating "add new constraints" to the "initial DECLARE model." Must merge/preserve originals.
- **Inaccurate activity assumptions (major)**: Introduces undefined activities (`Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`, `Approve`, `Reject`, etc.) not in original model (which uses `FinalDecision`, `RequestAdditionalInfo`). Prompt examples imply using/extending existing ones (e.g., `Reject` after sensitive checks), not fabricating new ones like `_Minority` variants or adding them to `existence` wholesale—alters model scope arbitrarily.
- **Logical flaws in constraints (major)**: 
  - `response` from sensitive checks to `BiasMitigationCheck` enforces "eventually follows" (not immediate), but prompt emphasizes preventing *immediate* follow (`non-succession` is correct direction, but botched). No `succession`/`chain` to enforce "in between."
  - Coexistence on fabricated `_Minority` activities doesn't tie to real bias mitigation (e.g., no link to `FinalDecision`).
  - Adds `existence` for all new activities unnecessarily/overreaching; prompt doesn't require mandating new events' existence.
- **Minor but penalized issues**: `precedence`, etc., preserved empty correctly; rationale explains *intended* additions well but can't salvage execution flaws. No unary constraints like `absence` for biased paths used. Explanation of bias reduction is generic but accurate.
- **Why not lower?** Output format matches (code block + rationale + summary); attempts relevant constraint types (coexistence, response, non-succession); preserves some originals (e.g., `succession`, `init`). But "nearly flawless" impossible—core output is broken/non-compliant.
