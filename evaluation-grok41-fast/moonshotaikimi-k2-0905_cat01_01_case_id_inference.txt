**10.0**

The provided answer is flawless. It correctly identifies the three distinct cases using patient_age and patient_gender as unique identifiers (no overlaps possible given the data), matches events chronologically and logically to standard department flows (ER: register  triage  diagnostics  consult  discharge; Surgery: register  consult  prep  surgery  recovery  discharge), assigns **all 18 events uniquely with zero leftovers or overlaps**, and ensures intra-case timestamp order. Additional_info aligns perfectly (e.g., Case 1: leg X-ray  hairline fracture; Case 2: blood panel/normal  infection/antibiotics; Case 3: scheduled knee  arthroscopy). The approach is explicitly stated, concise, and robust. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, logical gaps, or even minor nitpicks under hypercritical scrutiny.
