The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It accurately identifies all normative violations (Case 1: none; Case 2: Risk before Credit, missing Inform Applicant, Finalize after rejection, improper close logic; Case 3: none) with precise timestamp references and direct ties to rules. Desiderata failures are correctly pinpointed per case (Case 1: only potential unlogged Follow-up; Case 2: missing Inform + unlogged Follow-up; Case 3: delayed Credit/Inform + missing Follow-up), with explicit clarification of suboptimality/non-severity. Interpretations/justifications are plausible, constraint-aligned (e.g., triage for early Risk, delays due to external factors), and enhanced by practical suggestions without excusing violations. Structure mirrors task parts clearly; no inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, omissions, or extraneous content. Timings calculated exactly; all log details covered comprehensively.
