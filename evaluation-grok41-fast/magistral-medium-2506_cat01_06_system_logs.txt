**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting ~8/10 base):** Table format is clean, CSV-parseable, and includes required attributes (Case ID, Activity, Timestamp) plus useful extras (Application, Resource, Context). Case logic per-document/file is coherent and analyst-friendly, correctly linking Document1.docx events across a gap (post-Excel reference). Activities are mostly standardized/high-level (e.g., "Save Document"). Explanation covers objectives, narrative is logical, tool compatibility mentioned. Covers ~95% of raw events via mapping/inference (e.g., FOCUSOpen, TYPINGEdit, CLICKProcess/Reply).
- **Major Deductions (-1.5 total):**
  - **Omission of raw events:** First event (08:59:50 FOCUS Quarterly_Report.docx) completely dropped—no mapping to "Open Document" or similar. Switches (e.g., 09:01:45, 09:04:00, 09:06:00) handled implicitly but not explicitly addressed, leading to missing "Open" for some cases (PDF starts at SCROLL; no inferred open). Event log must transform *the provided log*, not selectively ignore.
  - **Case grouping flaw:** Quarterly_Report.docx case ignores initial FOCUS, treating it as new "Open" at 09:07:15 despite likely session continuity (user switched away/ back). Creates artificial split; coherent cases should infer full lifecycle per document.
- **Minor but Significant Deductions (-1.3 total):**
  - **Inconsistent activity names:** "Continue Editing Document" (09:06:15) breaks standardization vs. repeated "Edit Document." Should be uniform "Edit Document."
  - **Explanation-table mismatch:** Claims "repetitive actions... merged into a single activity" (e.g., multiple TYPINGone Edit), but table retains separate rows per timestamp/action (e.g., 3x Edit Document1, 2x Edit Spreadsheet, SCROLL as distinct Review). Misrepresents output; unaggregated granularity is fine but explanation lies.
  - **Vague/incomplete mappings:** Email "Process Email" (for CLICK Open) is underspecified vs. raw "Open Email about Annual Meeting." PDF lacks lifecycle closure (no Close inferred). Case ID "Email-Inbox" truncates "Email - Inbox" inconsistently.
  - **Narrative gaps:** Explanation says "started editing Document1" but log starts with Quarterly focus. Misses potential cross-case links (e.g., budget ref in Document1 could justify merging ExcelDocument1 subsequence).
- **Why not lower/higher:** Not 10 (not flawless: omissions, inconsistencies). Not <7 (core transformation succeeds, 21/25 raw lines meaningfully represented, strong narrative/process insights). Strict but fair—solid for analysis, flawed for completeness/precision.
