**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: 
  - Accurately identifies the core bias mechanism (+10 Community adjustment exclusively for "Highland Civic Darts Club" in C001/C004, carried through stages). 
  - Correctly summarizes patterns in tables and highlights implications for non-affiliated individuals (e.g., C003 rejection at 715 despite solid score).
  - Addresses question fully: attributes (CommunityGroup, LocalResident), favoring (niche group gets boost), fairness/equity impacts (social capital proxy disadvantages marginalized, perpetuates exclusion), and implications (double disadvantage for non-locals/no-community like C003).
  - Structured, comprehensive, evidence-based with log references; recommendations add value without speculation overload. Final conclusions are clear, logical, and directly tied to evidence.
  - Self-contained; corrects/ignores think tag issues.

- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Inaccuracies (major penalty)**: 
    - Factual error in patterns table: Claims C003 score (715) is "lower than C001/C004’s unadjusted scores (710  720 after adjustment)" – false; 715 > 710 (C001 unadj) and >690 (C004 unadj). This undermines a key comparative argument, making bias seem less stark than it is.
    - Factual error: Describes C003 as "local resident (TRUE)" in patterns section, contradicting log (FALSE) and own later statements (e.g., "non-local"). Creates internal inconsistency/confusion.
  - **Logical flaws/unclarities (moderate penalty)**:
    - Underemphasizes geographic bias strength: C004 (local+community, 700 adjusted) approved despite *lower* final score than C003 (715 unadjusted, rejected) – glaring inconsistency not explicitly called out as evidence of compounded local/community favoritism (prioritizes "trumps geographic" but misses how it enables lower-score approvals for favored).
    - Over-relies on community as "most significant" without quantifying (e.g., no non-local+community cases to test "trumps"; all bonuses to locals). Implies decisions purely score-driven post-adjustment, ignoring potential variable thresholds (700 pass for favored, 715 fails for disfavored).
    - Minor unclarity: C002 (local, no community, 720 approved) shows locals can pass without adjustment, diluting "double disadvantage" claim slightly without deeper nuance.
  - **Overall**: Nearly flawless structure/scope, but central factual errors in evidence/examples and incomplete paradox-highlighting prevent 9+ (not "nearly flawless"). Deducted ~2.8 points total (~1.5 for inaccuracies, ~1.0 for logic gaps, ~0.3 for minor unclarities).
