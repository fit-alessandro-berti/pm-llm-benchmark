**2.0**

The final process tree structure `* ( , -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) )` (with sloppy/empty notation for tau, should be explicit `'tau'`) within the sequence fails to fit the event log, specifically Case 3 (RA VF AE **RMI RMI VF** AD SC AC). The loop only permits traces of **(RMI VF)** repeated (or zero times: nothing), e.g., RMI VF or RMI VF RMI VF, but cannot produce consecutive RMI without intervening VF, nor a single VF after multiple RMI. This yields zero fitness for Case 3, contradicting the claimed "fits all traces" (which falsely alters Case 3 to nonexistent "RMI VF RMI VF"). Precision is also flawed as it forbids observed behaviors (multiple RMI pre-VF). Simplicity is adequate but irrelevant given core failures. Flat -> with 7 children is nonstandard (notation implies binary nesting). Major logical flaws in fitness/accuracy warrant minimal score.
