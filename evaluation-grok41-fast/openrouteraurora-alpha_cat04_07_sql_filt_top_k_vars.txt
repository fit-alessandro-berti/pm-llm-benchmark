The provided answer is flawless. It fully satisfies all requirements with a correct, efficient, single-statement DuckDB SQL query using CTEs:

- **Ordered sequence extraction**: `STRING_AGG(activity, '|' ORDER BY timestamp)` per `case_id` precisely captures the timestamp-ordered activity sequence as a unique string identifier (standard in process mining; delimiter choice is safe/practical with the given warning and alternatives).
- **Grouping/counting variants**: Correctly aggregates cases by exact sequence and counts frequencies.
- **Top K selection**: `ORDER BY case_cnt DESC LIMIT ?` accurately identifies top K by frequency (ties handled implicitly as unspecified; stable enough).
- **Filtering and return**: Joins back to `event_log` to return *exactly* `el.*` (all original columns/events) for *only* cases in top K variants, excluding others. Added `ORDER BY` enhances usability without altering correctness.
- No extra rows/columns; no performance flaws (DuckDB-optimized CTEs); parameterized (`?`) for K; handles edge cases (e.g., duplicate activities via concatenation, empty cases implicitly filtered).

Explanations are precise, non-intrusive, and enhance clarity without impacting the query. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or violations—even minor ones. Perfect match to prompt.
