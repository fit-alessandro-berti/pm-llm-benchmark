**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**: 
  - Perfectly follows instructions: Groups all 15 events into logical, sequential phases (Idle 1-3+13-15; Cutting 4-6; Assembling 7-8; Welding 9; Inspection 10-12). Labels are intuitive and match prompt examples ("Cutting Metal," "Assembling Parts," "Welding," "Quality Inspection"). 
  - Rationales are strong, physics-based, and tied to sensor patterns (e.g., high temp/vibration for cutting/welding; pressure for assembly; low activity for idle/inspection). Transitions are coherent.
  - Excellent structure: Clear tables/sections, process flow summary, Mermaid diagram visualizing the cycle—exceeds basic requirements without fluff.
  - Conclusions flawless: Accurate event grouping, inferred process flow matches timestamp sequence, no logical flaws in deductions.

- **Weaknesses (Deductions)**:
  - **Inaccuracies in sensor pattern transcription (major deductions, -1.5 total)**: Multiple sloppy range notations without hyphens/dashes make them unclear or wrong (e.g., "5058°C" vs. "50-58°C"; "3038 Hz" vs. "30-38 Hz"; "23 kWh" vs. "2-3 kWh"; "3025°C" vs. "30-25°C"; "01 units/s" vs. "0-1 units/s"; "1520 mm" vs. "15-20 mm"). Critically, pressure for Cutting listed as "(11.5 bar)"—blatant error (actual: 1-1.5 bar); this misreports core data, undermining pattern credibility.
  - **Unnecessary/hallucinated citations ([1][4] etc., -0.3)**: No sources in prompt; appears fabricated from <think> (ignored per rules), adding irrelevant noise.
  - **Minor unclarities (-0.0)**: Combined "Quality Inspection/Packaging Prep" label slightly stretches one phase but justified by patterns; no penalty as inference task allows it.

Nearly flawless analysis/logic elevates score, but data errors prevent 9+ (strictly "any inaccuracies" penalize heavily). Equivalent to A- work: insightful but not publication-ready precise.
