The final answer is flawless: it precisely identifies Cases 2, 3, and 5 as deviating (correct), provides accurate, text-referenced explanations for each violation without errors or overreach, correctly classifies Cases 1 and 4 as compliant, and offers concise, logical interpretations (e.g., Cancel implies insufficient inventory, enforcing direct Check  Cancel). No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws; structure enhances clarity.
