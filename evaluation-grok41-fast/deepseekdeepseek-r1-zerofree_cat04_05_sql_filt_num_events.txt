**10.0**

The final boxed query is correct, efficient, and precisely matches the requirements: it identifies `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via a non-correlated subquery and returns all events (`SELECT *`) for only those cases. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws; standard SQL fully compatible with DuckDB, handles arbitrary additional columns via `*`, and avoids unnecessary complexity.
