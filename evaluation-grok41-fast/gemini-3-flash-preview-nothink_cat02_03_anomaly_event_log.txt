**10.0**

The response is exemplary: comprehensively identifies all key anomalies across Cases 1002–1004 with precise timestamp references and logical sequencing violations against standard P2P flow (PR  Approval  PO  Goods  Invoice  Match  Payment). Explanations are incisive, tying directly to business risks (e.g., maverick buying, loss of leverage, fraud exposure) using domain-specific terminology without speculation. Case 1001 correctly baselined. Structure enhances readability (sections, bullet points, summary table). No inaccuracies, omissions, ambiguities, or flaws—strictly flawless execution.
