**2.1**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Assessment)
- **Fitness (major failure, -4.0 penalty)**: The model fails to replay key traces:
  - Case 2 (RA  VF  AE  AD  SC  AC): Impossible, as `* (->('RMI','VF'), 'AD')` mandates **at least one** RMI  VF after AE (per loop semantics: always executes A first, no zero-iteration option despite claim of "zero or more").
  - Case 3 (RA  VF  AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC): Impossible. Loop generates (RMI  VF)+ optionally followed by AD in redo positions, yielding e.g., RMI VF or RMI VF AD RMI VF, but never RMI RMI VF (no consecutive RMIs without interleaving VF).
  - AD misplaced: Treated as loop "redo" (B), enabling invalid mid-loop AD executions; traces show single terminal AD.
  - SC  AC only in right branch; left branch can "complete" without them if loop exits early, risking incomplete traces.
- **Precision (major failure, -2.5 penalty)**: Top-level `+` enables invalid interleavings (e.g., AD  SC  AC before/during RA  VF  AE), unseen in log. Overgenerates massively (e.g., RMI VF AD RMI VF paths, AD-first traces). Loop misunderstanding exacerbates extraneous behaviors.
- **Simplicity (minor failure, -0.5 penalty)**: Unnecessary top-level `+` and flawed loop overcomplicate; cleaner sequential structure with proper optional loop needed.
- **Syntax & Clarity (minor issues, -0.4 penalty)**: Multiple conflicting trees shown (initial seq-only, then "true concurrency" snippet, then "combined"); final lacks SC  AC integration in main flow. Loop semantics misrepresented ("zero or more before AD"—false). Labels correct, but structure un-executable as-is (e.g., no explicit parent/child adherence noted).
- **Completeness & Task Fit (-0.5 penalty)**: Ignores re-validation VF as optional repeat (fits log but not modeled optionally). No tau. Claims balance but delivers neither fitness nor precision.
- **Base (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies core sequence (RA  VF  AE  ...  AD  SC  AC), loop location post-AE, RMI-VF relation (+1.0). Attempt at loop (+0.5). No criminal/policy violations.

Total: Starts at ~4.0 for effort/insights, deducts heavily for fatal behavioral mismatches and misconceptions. Far from "nearly flawless"—fundamentally broken.
