**9.5**

### Detailed Evaluation (Hypercritical Breakdown)
The SQL query is **exceptionally strong** (essentially flawless: 10/10 on its own), correctly implementing the requirements with elegant use of `LEAD` for consecutive event detection, precise timestamp differencing for the >5 day condition, and a clean anti-join for case exclusion. It handles edge cases well (e.g., missing subsequent events return NULL, no false positives; DISTINCT ensures whole-case exclusion if *any* qualifying triple exists). DuckDB syntax is perfect (intervals, quoting, USING clause). Ordering in the final result is a nice touch, though unrequired. Comments are clear and accurate.

**Minor deduction (-0.5) for inaccuracy/unclear wording in the explanation**:
- The final bullet states: "or have it but with 5 days between ‘Create Order’ and ‘Confirm Order’."
  - This is imprecise and potentially misleading. Cases kept include those with the triple *and gap 5 days* (not just "with 5 days," which implies ~exactly 5 or at least 5). A hypercritical reading sees this as an inaccuracy: a case with a 3-day gap is kept, but the phrasing doesn't clearly cover it. Should be "with 5 days or less" or "where the gap does not exceed 5 days."
  - Earlier explanation parts (e.g., "> five days" for exclusion) are exact, mitigating but not eliminating the flaw.
- Double space ("with  5 days"): trivial typo, but noted under strictness.

No logical flaws, no performance issues, no missing requirements, no unclarities in SQL. No over/under-filtering. **Nearly flawless overall**; the explanation nitpick prevents a perfect 10.0 under "even minor issues significantly lower" (here, minor = small deduction).
