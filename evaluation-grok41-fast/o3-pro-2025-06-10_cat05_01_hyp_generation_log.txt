**9.0**

### Evaluation Summary
This SYSTEM prompt is highly effective at steering a downstream LLM toward the target behaviors: identifying anomalies from an event log, hypothesizing root causes (with appropriate examples like fraud or glitches), and proposing investigative SQL queries using only the specified tables. It adheres closely to the requirements by providing schema, normal flow, illustrative (non-exhaustive) samples without spoiling anomalies or SQL examples, and enforcing a clean, structured output format that prevents extraneous reasoning. The instructions are precise, mapping hypotheses to anomalies and queries to hypotheses, while explicitly limiting to the three tables.

### Strengths (Supporting High Score)
- **No hints or guidance on *how***: Perfectly avoids revealing specific anomalies (e.g., out-of-order events in cases 1002–1004, premature payments in 1004, skipped activities in 1003), root causes, or SQL patterns. Samples focus on normal flow (case 1001) and endpoints, forcing the LLM to analyze provided data independently.
- **Task alignment**: Directly mirrors the target prompt—spot anomalies/deviations/undesirable behaviors, hypothesize (e.g., policy/training/system/fraud), suggest concrete SQL for validation/exploration.
- **Output control**: Strict format (A/B/C sections, bulleted/mapped/labelled) ensures concise, actionable results. "Do not explain your reasoning" prevents verbosity.
- **Completeness for use**: Schema accurate (minor INT vs. INTEGER irrelevant in PostgreSQL). Assumed flow enables deviation detection. Examples illustrate data format without enabling full analysis alone, assuming full log (e.g., pasted tables) in user message—logical for a "ready-to-paste" system prompt.
- **Encourages relevant joins**: Includes `resources` and `orders` schemas/samples, priming for queries like department/role mismatches (e.g., Finance before Sales) or value-based filters.

### Weaknesses (Deductions for Strict/Hypercritical Review)
- **Formatting unclarities (major nitpick, -0.5)**: Normal sequence crammed as "1 Register Order2 Perform Credit Check3..." lacks spaces/newlines, risking misparse (e.g., "Order2" as activity). Easily fixable with numbered list.
- **Sample data presentation (-0.3)**: Tuples lack quotes (e.g., strings/decimals), timestamps abbreviated (no seconds), and heavy "…" usage slightly reduces parsability, though illustrative and non-fatal.
- **Minor schema shorthand (-0.2)**: Bullet format compact but readable; no lengths on VARCHAR (irrelevant).

Nearly flawless in intent, structure, and non-spoiling design—flaws are cosmetic, not logical/functional, but per "hypercritical even minor issues significantly lower," capped at 9.0 vs. 10.0. With polished formatting, it would be perfect.
