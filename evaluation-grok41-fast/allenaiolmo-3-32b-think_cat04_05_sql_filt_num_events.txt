**9.5**

The provided SQL query is correct, concise, efficient, and precisely matches the requirements: it uses a subquery to identify `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then filters the full `event_log` to return all events (`SELECT *`) from only those cases. This fully excludes cases with >6 events and returns the complete event sets for qualifying cases, using standard SQL fully compatible with DuckDB. No syntax errors, no unnecessary complexity, and optimal for the task (subquery avoids redundant grouping).

Minor deduction (-0.5) for a single imprecise phrase in the "Key Features" section ("cases with 6 total events" instead of "6 or fewer"), which introduces a trivial inaccuracy despite the query, subquery explanation, and overall description correctly stating `<= 6` / "6 or fewer events." This is a non-critical slip but noted under hypercritical evaluation criteria. Everything else (logic, efficiency notes, compatibility) is flawless.
