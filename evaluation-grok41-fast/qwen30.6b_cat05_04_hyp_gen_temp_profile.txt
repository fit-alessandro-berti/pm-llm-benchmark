**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Anomalies Identification (6.5/10)**: Correctly identifies the four key anomalies from the profile (R-P low STDEV, P-N long/high variance, A-C quick/possibly skipping steps, E-N too rapid/low STDEV). Descriptions are mostly accurate (e.g., times match converted seconds), but phrasing is occasionally vague or imprecise (e.g., "irregular approval schedules" for R-P doesn't clearly tie to low STDEV rigidity; A-C assumes "no consistent evaluation steps" without quantifying from data).
  
- **Hypotheses Generation (3.0/10)**: Lists generic reasons but fails to align them logically with specific anomalies. E.g., "Systemic Delays" for quick E-N (contradicts "delays"); "Automated Rapid Execution" for long P-N (opposite of rapid); "Bottlenecks" for quick A-C (mismatch). Lacks depth (no ties to business logic, data entry, backlogs as prompted); feels copied/placed without thought. Misses stronger ideas like artificial timing, skipping steps, or region-specific issues.

- **SQL Verification Proposals (1.0/10)**: Catastrophically flawed—unrunnable, semantically wrong, ignores schema:
  | Issue | Details |
  |-------|---------|
  | **Schema Errors** | References nonexistent `temporal_profile` table; assumes `time` column (schema has `timestamp`); `region` on `claims` (it's on `adjusters`, requires JOIN via `resource`? but unlinked); no `adjuster_id`/`claim_type` properly joined. |
  | **Syntax/Logic Errors** | Malformed subqueries (e.g., `WHERE activity='R' AND time`—`time` unbound); `HAVING` with unrelated scalar subqueries; `NOT IN (AVG(...) LIMIT 1)` nonsensical (single scalar vs. list); no per-claim time diffs (e.g., no `LAG`/`LEAD`, window funcs, or self-JOINs on `claim_id` for intervals). |
  | **Relevance Failure** | Doesn't compute deviations (no AVG/STDEV/ZETA checks); no outlier filtering (e.g., `ABS(diff - avg) > zeta * stdev`); no correlations (e.g., GROUP BY `resource`/JOIN `adjusters`; no `claim_type` filters); no specific patterns like "immediate A-C" or "long P-N". Queries return garbage or error.
  | **Completeness** | Vague comments don't match query intent; misses prompted examples (e.g., customer/region segments via `customer_id`).

- **Overall Structure/Prompt Compliance (4.0/10)**: Independently presented sections (good); no instruction references (good). But verbose/intro unnecessary; doesn't fully cover "unusually small/large STDEV" explicitly; no ZETA/deviation math in queries.

**Why not lower?** Anomalies section is salvageable. **Why not higher?** SQL is core task (1/3 weight), utterly broken—minor fixes impossible without rewrite. Total flaws disqualify from >5; strictness demands this.
