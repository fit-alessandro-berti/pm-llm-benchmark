### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Correctness of Primary Query (First SQL)**: Flawless. Uses a correlated subquery with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to precisely identify qualifying `case_id`s, then `IN` to filter and `SELECT *` to return **all columns** for the full events of those cases. Matches the task exactly: excludes >6 events per case, returns complete rows for <=6. No logical flaws, efficient in DuckDB (optimizable via hash semi-join).
- **Correctness of Alternative Query (Window Function CTE)**: Mostly correct logically (`COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)` accurately computes per-case totals, filter works). However, **significant flaw**: Outer `SELECT` lists only `case_id, activity, timestamp`, omitting any other columns (table has "**at least**" these, implying potential extras like `resource` or `attributes`). Comment acknowledges ("Add other columns if necessary") but **fails to implement** a complete solution (e.g., no `SELECT * EXCEPT(event_count)` or full list). This violates "full set of events." Performance claim ("potentially better... on very large datasets") is subjective/optimistic but not inaccurate (DuckDB optimizes both well; windows avoid extra scan but may use more memory).
- **Clarity and Style**: Excellent comments, proper formatting, aliases. Dual approaches show depth (subquery classic/safe; window modern). No syntax errors for DuckDB.
- **Completeness**: Primary query fully solves task standalone. Alternative adds value but introduces incompleteness, preventing 10.0. No overkill, no extras.
- **Strict Deductions**: -0.5 for alternative's column omission (incomplete output violates "full set"); no other inaccuracies/unclarities. Nearly flawless overall—primary is perfect, alternative 90% there.
