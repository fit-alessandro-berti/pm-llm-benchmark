The provided answer is flawless: it precisely meets all requirements with correct DuckDB syntax, logical structure, and efficiency. 

- **Sequence extraction**: `list_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp ASC)` perfectly captures ordered variants per `case_id`.
- **Grouping/counting**: Groups by exact list equality (DuckDB-native), counts frequencies accurately.
- **Top K selection**: `ORDER BY frequency DESC LIMIT K` correctly identifies top variants (parameterized appropriately).
- **Filtering**: Join-based `target_cases` CTE excludes non-top-K cases without data loss or duplication.
- **Final output**: Returns exact original events (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`) for filtered cases only, properly ordered.
- No inaccuracies, inefficiencies, ambiguities, or extraneous elements; explanation enhances clarity without errors. Handles edge cases (e.g., ties via stable ordering, empty top-K) implicitly correct. Zero deductions.
