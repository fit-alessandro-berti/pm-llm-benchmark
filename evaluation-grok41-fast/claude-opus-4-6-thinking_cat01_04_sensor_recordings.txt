**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (driving high score)**: 
  - Perfect coverage of all 15 events with logical, sequential grouping based on clear sensor pattern shifts (e.g., baselines for idle, peaks for welding, progressions in tool position).
  - Labels directly match prompt examples ("Cutting Metal," "Assembling Parts," "Welding," "Quality Inspection," "Packaging") plus sensible "Idle/Standby" for non-active phases.
  - Rationales are precise, data-driven, and intuitive, linking specific sensor changes (e.g., rising vibration + tool advance = cutting; simultaneous peaks + zero flow = welding) to activities without overgeneralization.
  - Excellent structure: per-phase tables, summary table, ASCII process model visualizing flow—exceeds requirements for clarity and insight.
  - No major inaccuracies in pattern detection; groupings align tightly with timestamped transitions (e.g., tool position progression 01015200).

- **Flaws/Deductions (strict, hypercritical)**:
  - **Counting inconsistency (-0.5)**: Overview claims "**six distinct phases**"; lists seven (Phases 1–7). This is a clear factual error, undermining precision despite correct identification of seven logical segments.
  - **Minor formatting nitpicks (-0.2)**: Double space in Phase 2 Temperature table ("50  55  58"); inconsistent table styling (some have full lists, others summarized). Trivial but clarity flaws.
  - **Slight over-speculation in rationales (-0.1)**: Phrases like "light sensor probe" (Phase 5) or "packaging material (wrapping, boxing, labeling)" add unneeded assumption beyond data; still data-tied but not 100% deductive.
  - **No other logical flaws**: Groupings optimal (e.g., Event 10 correctly isolated as cooldown/inspect vs. packaging); no misattributions.

Nearly flawless (flawless would be 10.0: zero inconsistencies, perfect count, zero nits). Deductions are minimal but enforced per "even minor issues...significantly lower" (scaled proportionally: ~0.8 total off perfection).
