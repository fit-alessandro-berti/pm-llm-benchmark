This response is exemplary and flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It delivers precisely 20 open-ended, thought-provoking questions, each meticulously tied to the pseudo-BPMN process (e.g., referencing specific gateways, tasks like sourcing from named countries, assembly in Malaysia, air/ship splits, quality exclusive gateway, etc.). Coverage of required topics is comprehensive and balanced: rationale (Q1,2,5,7,8,17), improvements (Q3,6,9,13,14,16,20), risk management (Q4,11,15,18), decision-making (Q5,8,11,15), stakeholder communication (Q2,12,16,19), performance measurement (Q10,12). No yes/no questions, no SQL or extraneous content, no unclarities, inaccuracies, or logical flaws—even minor phrasing issues are absent (all questions are concise, precise, and provocative). Perfect adherence to "just list the questions."
