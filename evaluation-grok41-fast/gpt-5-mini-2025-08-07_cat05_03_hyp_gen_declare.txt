### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
This answer is exceptionally strong—thorough, logically sound, directly responsive to all three tasks, and enriched with precise, executable PostgreSQL queries that leverage schema details effectively (e.g., FILTER clauses, array_agg, date_trunc). It independently presents anomalies, hypotheses, and verification without referencing prompt hints. SQLs astutely target model constraints (e.g., #2 directly tests noncoexistence, #4 tests responded_existence) while extending to order/precedence/init issues and data quality (resources/adjusters), aligning with examples like "claims closed without evaluation" and "evaluation...with assigned adjusters." Hypotheses mirror prompt examples verbatim in spirit (misinterpretation, incremental changes, data issues, pressure) with added plausibility. Anomalies nail the core unsatisfiability (mandatory C + ¬(EC)  ¬E, undermining RAEPNC flow) and subtleties (template misuse, redundancy).

**Minor deductions (-0.5 total, strictly applied):**
- **Anomaly 3 (responded_existence):** Accurately flags wrong template/direction (responded_existence(E,A) enforces existence not order/precedence; business needs A  E), but slightly unclear on DECLARE semantics—says "E -> A (or existence without order)" which is correct, yet implies "E -> A" might enforce order (it doesn't); could explicitly state "responded_existence(E,A) requires A exists anywhere if E occurs, but permits E before A and ignores multiples."
- **SQL #8:** Ambitious and useful (extends to adjuster correspondence), but logical overreach assumes `first_a_resource  first_e_resource` (same adjuster performs both? Schema allows reassignment; resource may be ID/name mismatch despite #9). `IS DISTINCT FROM` handles NULLs well, but query flags "mismatch" as anomaly without schema-proof that same-resource is required—minor unclarity in intent.
- **SQL #9:** `ce.resource::text = a.adjuster_id::text OR ce.resource = a.name` is pragmatic guess (VARCHAR resource vs INT ID/VARCHAR name), but unproven mapping; could fail if resource is adjuster_id as INT stringified inconsistently—logical flaw if data uses IDs numerically.
- **Extras (remediation/offers):** Insightful (e.g., correct templates), but prompt demands *independent* presentation of three tasks; remediation subtly violates "Do not include...hints" spirit by advising model fixes (though not prompt hints).
- **Completeness nit:** No queries for missing P/N (e.g., C without P), but model lacks them—fair, as focus is given constraints' contradictions.

Flawless on core (contradiction ID, hypotheses, primary verifications); deductions only for hyperstrict edge pedantry. Any lesser answer would score <8.0.
