**7.2**

### Reasoning for the Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**:
  - Correct overall structure: Places and main sequence (Start  CR  DV  FC  CA  AP  P  N  Closed) accurately reflect the linear flow.
  - Loops modeled effectively with choice points (e.g., DV_place enables both FC_trans and RDS_trans; FC_place enables CA_trans and II_trans), allowing non-deterministic firing for "if incomplete" / "if doubts" conditions and multiple iterations via back transitions.
  - All required activities have labeled transitions (CR="Claim Registration", DV="Document Verification", RDS="Re-Document Submission", FC="Fraud Check", II="In-depth Investigation", CA="Claim Assessment", AP="Approval", P="Payment", N="Notification", Closed="Closure" matching CL).
  - Proper use of `add_arc_from_to` for both input (place  transition) and output (transition  place) arcs throughout.
  - Initial/final markings correct: `im[start_place]=1`, `fm[closed_place]=1`.
  - pm4py imports and usage flawless (no removal needed, unlike example).

- **Major Flaws (significant deductions)**:
  - **Syntax error in code**: `petri_utils.add_arc_from,_to(fc_place, ii_trans, net)` (invalid comma in function name). Code fails to execute, preventing construction of a valid net. Critical for a code-based task (-1.5).
  - **Invented transitions/labels**: `RDS_back` ("Re-check Documents") and `II_back` ("Re-check Fraud") are not in the scenario's activity list (CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL). Problem specifies "transitions labeled with the activity names" from the described steps; extras violate this, introducing unmentioned activities (-1.0). Alternative (silent/unlabeled transitions) would also fail, but invention is a logical mismatch.
  - **Missing conditional for AP**: Scenario states AP occurs "if the amount surpasses a certain threshold" (optional branch post-CA). Modeled as mandatory linear flow (CA  AP always); no choice/skip modeled (-0.8).
  - **No initial "C" (Insurance Claim filing)**: Scenario starts with "customer files an Insurance Claim (C)", but omitted; jumps directly to CR (-0.3).
  - **Minor unclarities**: Explanation claims "all transitions are labeled with the activity names" (false due to extras); assumes invented labels are "necessary" without justification. Places named after activities (standard), but no comment on token flow validation (-0.2).

- **Why not lower/higher?** Structure and loop logic are logically sound and match "possible loops... multiple times" precisely (token can cycle DV  RDS, FC  II indefinitely before proceeding). Without syntax/invention/conditional flaws, 9.5+. Deductions total ~3.8 from 10.0 = 7.2. Not "nearly flawless" due to non-executable code and inaccuracies, but functional intent clear and comprehensive.
