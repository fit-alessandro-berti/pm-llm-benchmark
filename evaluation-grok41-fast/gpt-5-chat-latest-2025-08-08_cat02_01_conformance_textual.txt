**9.5**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (Justifying High Score)**:
  - **Accuracy**: Correctly identifies violating cases (2, 3, 5) with no false positives/negatives. All explanations align precisely with the normative description's sequences, constraints (e.g., sequencing of Check  Auth  Package  Ship; no Ship after Cancel; Close final), and implied branch exclusivity (fulfillment vs. cancellation). Case 5's missing "Package items" is correctly flagged as violating "Ship order should only occur after packaging" and the mandatory fulfillment sequence.
  - **Comprehensiveness**: Analyzes **all** cases individually (excellent structure with steps/tables). References description implicitly/accurately (e.g., "payment must be authorized before packaging"; "never after a 'Cancel order'").
  - **Clarity/Structure**: Step-by-step breakdown, rules restatement, per-case details, summary table, and bolded final answer are exemplary. Interprets ambiguities well (e.g., mixed branches as violations).
  - **Logical Soundness**: No flaws; correctly infers "mixed paths not allowed" from branch descriptions and constraints.

- **Minor Deductions (Strict/Hypercritical)**:
  - **Unnecessary Extra (0.3 deduction)**: Offers "visual alignment diagram" at end—task is strictly "identify which cases... explain violations"; this is unrequested bloat, potentially distracting, though harmless.
  - **Slight Repetition/Redundancy (0.2 deduction)**: "Final Answer" section repeats summary table content verbatim (e.g., Case 2 phrasing identical). Minor unclarity in over-emphasis, risking perceived padding.
  
Nearly flawless; deductions are nitpicks but mandated by "even minor issues should result in a significantly lower score" (here, minimal impact: -0.5 total). Anything less would be 8.x or below.
