**7.0**

### Justification (strict evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting score above 5.0)**: Correct format (Python dict with tuple keys `(activity1, activity2)` where 1 precedes 2, values as `(avg, stdev)` in seconds). Includes representative subset with complexity (9 consecutive + 17 non-consecutive/long-span pairs like `('SS', 'AS')`, covering early-to-late dependencies). Realistic domain estimates (e.g., procurement ~days/weeks, manufacturing ~hours, distribution/after-sales ~days/months; stdevs scale plausibly ~10-30% of avg). Comments provide transparency and rationale.
- **Flaws penalizing from 10.0 (hypercritical deductions)**:
  - **Inaccurate averages (major logical flaw, -2.0)**: Non-consecutive avgs inconsistent with sums of intermediates (transitivity violation in linear process; avgs must satisfy `avg(A,C)  avg(A,B) + avg(B,C)`). Examples: RC-PT expected ~151200s vs 172800s (+14%); RC-DT ~334800s vs 259200s (-23%); QI-DT ~248400s vs 194400s (-22%); CA-DT ~205200s vs 172800s (-16%); SS-DT ~1,026,000s vs 967200s (-6%); OP-DT ~960600s vs 882000s (-8%). Sloppy calculations undermine credibility.
  - **Minor redundancies/inconsistencies (-0.5)**: `('DT', 'AS')` duplicated (same value, but unnecessary). Some short spans exact (good), but cumulative errors amplify.
  - **Stdevs plausible but unverified (-0.3)**: Larger for spans (ok for estimation/correlation), but not rigorously derived (e.g., SS-RC stdev 172800s >> (3600² + 86400²) 86k s).
  - **Subset completeness (-0.2)**: Representative, but omits mid-spans (e.g., no SS-PT, OP-PK, RC-AS) despite "ensuring complexity."
- **Overall**: Strong structure/realism, but numerical/logical inaccuracies prevent "nearly flawless" (high 9-10). Equivalent to B-/C+ work: functional but error-prone.
