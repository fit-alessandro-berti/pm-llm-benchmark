**5.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting >1.0)**: 
  - Comprehensive subset of pairs (~45 entries, covering direct, mid-range, and long-range "eventual" pairs across the linear process SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS, fulfilling "representative subset" and "complexity" requirements.
  - Realistic supply chain estimates (e.g., long supplier lead times ~14d for OP-RC, quick internal steps like PT-PK ~0.5d, post-distribution AS delays ~30d).
  - Proper format: Valid Python dict keys as tuples, values as (avg_seconds, stdev_seconds), with stdevs plausibly increasing with distance (e.g., short pairs ~10-30% of avg, long ~30-40%).
  - Excellent clarity/structure: Grouped logically with helpful comments converting seconds to days for readability.
  - Global chain sums often approximately align (e.g., SS-DT ~28d roughly matches cumulative ~28d path sum).

- **Major Logical Flaws/Inaccuracies (heavy deductions)**:
  - **Violation of additive property (critical, repeated)**: In a linear sequential process, avg(A,C) **must equal** avg(A,B) + avg(B,C) exactly (since t(A,C) = t(A,B) + t(B,C) in every trace). Multiple violations, some impossible (avg < segment sum):
    | Flawed Triple | Listed avgs (days) | Sum | Listed A-C | Issue |
    |---------------|-------------------|-----|------------|-------|
    | OP-RC-DT | OP-RC=14, RC-DT=12 | 26 | OP-DT=24 | Impossible (< sum) |
    | SS-RC-DT | SS-RC=17, RC-DT=12 | 29 | SS-DT=28 | Off by 1d |
    | OP-RC-QI | OP-RC=14, RC-QI=1 | 15 | OP-QI=14.5 | Off by 0.5d |
    | SS-RC-QI | SS-RC=17, RC-QI=1 | 18 | SS-QI=17.5 | Off by 0.5d |
    | PK-WS-DT | PK-WS=0.25, WS-DT=5 | 5.25 | PK-DT=3 | Impossible (< sum) |
    | RC-DT-AS | RC-DT=12, DT-AS=30 | 42 | RC-AS=55 | Impossible (> sum? No, = required) |
    | QI-DT | QI-CA=2 + CA-DT=10 | ~12 | 15 | Off by ~3d |
    - These are not "estimates" excuses—core model definition requires consistency from "event logs" of sequential traces. ~10+ such cases.
  - **Impossibilities**: Negative implied times (e.g., PK-DT < PK-WS + WS-DT violates triangle inequality for positive durations).
  - **Incomplete coverage in sections**: E.g., QI section misses QI-WS/AS (added sporadically in "cross"), uneven (QI:4 pairs, RC:7).

- **Minor Issues (further deductions)**:
  - Duplicate keys (e.g., ('OP','PT'), ('RC','PK')) with identical values—valid dict (last wins), but sloppy code.
  - Rounding/precision oddities (e.g., 17.5d = 1512000s exact? But inconsistent with integers elsewhere).
  - Some stdevs not perfectly variance-adding (e.g., SS-RC stdev=6d vs sqrt(SS-OP 1d² + OP-RC 4d²)4.1d), minor for estimates but adds to flaws.
  - No pairs for some logical long-range (e.g., CA-AS, QI-AS fully absent).

Overall: Strong effort in scope/structure/realism, but repeated core logical violations (additivity failures, impossibilities) make it unreliable as a "temporal profile model." Not "nearly flawless"—significant rework needed for consistency. 5.0 reflects "adequate attempt with fatal flaws."
