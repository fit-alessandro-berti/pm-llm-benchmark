**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (Supporting High Score):**
- **Accuracy on Normative Violations (Near-Perfect, ~10/10):** Correctly identifies Case 1 as compliant with precise sequence recap. Case 2 accurately flags three key violations: (1) Risk Assessment before Credit Check, (2) missing Inform Applicant (strictly required post-Decision), (3) Finalize Documentation after rejection. Case 3 correctly cleared (delays don't violate strict ordering). No factual errors; explanations align perfectly with rules (e.g., no skipping, no reversal, no contradictory actions).
- **Accuracy on Desiderata (~9.5/10):** Precisely IDs follow-up omissions across all cases, Case 3 timings (~49h Credit, ~51h Inform) with correct approximations matching log math, and clarifies "not strict violations—just suboptimal." Case 2's "moot" timings logical given core failures. Distinguishes desiderata well.
- **Interpretations/Justifications (~9.5/10):** Reasonable, constraint-aligned suggestions (e.g., Case 2 preliminary data/system error; Case 3 holidays/staffing). Covers all cases ("when possible"); doesn't over-justify violations as compliant.
- **Structure & Completeness (~9/10):** Matches task's 1-2-3 numbering; per-case breakdown clear; summary concise/accurate ("Only Case 2 violates strict rules").
- **Overall Logic/Clarity:** Flawless reasoning—no contradictions, misreads of log, or ignoring rules (e.g., notes Inform mandatory, branch logic).

**Flaws (Deductions for Strictness, Total -0.8):**
- **Minor Unclarity/Typo ( -0.3):** "Normativerule" (missing space, first header mangled)—hypercritical: creates tiny readability hiccup, unprofessional for "flawless."
- **Formatting Inconsistency ( -0.3):** Case 1 sequence "(Application Received  Credit Check ...)"—missing  arrows (unlike query's style), extra/misaligned spaces ("Received  Credit"). Hypercritical: minor unclarity in visual flow, could confuse skimmers despite obvious intent.
- **Minor Structural Oddity ( -0.2):** Interpretations bullets out-of-order (Case 2, 3, then 1)—not logical flaw but unintuitive, violates "natural" per-case flow from Parts 1-2.
- No logical flaws or factual inaccuracies; these are purely presentation nitpicks, but per instructions, even minors "significantly lower" from 10.0 (hence 9.2, not 9.9—strict calibration). Substance justifies very high score; polish prevents perfection.
