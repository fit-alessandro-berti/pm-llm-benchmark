**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (supporting the score)**: The questions are uniformly open-ended, targeted, and conceptual—no SQL, code, or implementation details. They effectively probe decision criteria (e.g., Q1, Q2, Q5, Q9), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q2, Q8), missing details (e.g., Q3, Q4), and exceptions (e.g., Q6, Q7). Coverage spans most process stages (documentation, assignment, inspections, marketing, screening, audits, decisions). Format is a clear numbered list, enhancing readability.
  
- **Flaws and Deductions (strict penalties applied)**:
  - **Missed explicit "timing and sequencing" (major deduction: -1.5)**: Prompt mandates questions to "verify timing and sequencing." Zero questions address this (e.g., no "How long does documentation verification typically take?" or "Is the inspector always scheduled after the introductory meeting, or can steps overlap?"). Q3 and Q9 touch sequencing indirectly via "before" or "subsequent steps," but this is insufficient—hypercritical standard requires direct coverage of a named goal.
  - **Q10 irrelevant to described process (moderate deduction: -0.8)**: Introduces post-onboarding "feedback loop from tenants and landlords," absent from the description (which ends at move-in/audits). This speculates beyond "uncover missing details" in the given process, diluting focus.
  - **Incomplete stage coverage/gaps in missing details (moderate deduction: -0.7)**: No questions on key undetailed elements like property database entry specifics (e.g., data fields/validation), photographer's distinct role (separate from inspector), introductory call/meeting details, multi-tenant complexity, lease negotiation for multiple applicants, or communication tools (CRM/email). Ties unique features to marketing (Q4) instead of manager assignment—minor misalignment with description.
  - **Extraneous elements (minor deductions: -0.5 total)**: Bold titles are helpful but unspecified/unnecessary (prompt seeks "list of ... questions"). Closing sentence adds unrequested summary, bloating response.
  - **Logical/minor unclarities (minor deduction: -0.3)**: Q4 assumes "unique features" drive marketing factors (description links them to manager assignment). Q8 focuses post-activation but overlooks pre-activation checks.

- **Overall**: Strong conceptual depth (80% alignment), but explicit prompt gaps (timing/sequencing) and off-topic addition prevent "nearly flawless." Equivalent to B-/A- work under strict grading—solid utility, clear room for precision.
