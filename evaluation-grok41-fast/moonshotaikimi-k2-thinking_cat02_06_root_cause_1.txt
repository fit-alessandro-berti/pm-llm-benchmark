**9.7**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Task Coverage (Perfect: 10/10)**: Fully addresses all 3 tasks with matching sections. Identifies cases precisely (105 as critical outlier; 102/104 as borderline, justified via median comparison). Root causes (escalations, overnight delays, queues, triage) directly tied to log evidence. Explanations of cycle time impacts are mechanistic and quantified (e.g., 4x multiplier, 28h gap). Recommendations are insightful, prioritized (quick win), and tabular for clarity—exceeds basic requirements.
  
- **Accuracy (Near-Perfect: 9.8/10)**: Times/medias correct (minor 24.2h rounding from 24.17h irrelevant). Patterns match log exactly (e.g., 105's 28h escalation gap, 19h overnights). Averages (triage ~16m vs exact 18m; escal/non-escal) precise enough. No factual errors in conclusions.

- **Clarity & Precision (Near-Perfect: 9.9/10)**: Tables enhance readability. Quantified comparisons (% above/below) and specifics (timestamps) eliminate ambiguity. Only micro-issue: Labels Case 104 "at median" yet groups as "borderline slow"—logical since skewed distribution makes 24h >> fast cases (1-2h), but strictly pedantic as not "significantly longer" than median itself.

- **Logical Flaws/Comprehensiveness (Near-Perfect: 9.9/10)**: Causal links robust (e.g., shift pauses  24h penalties). No overgeneralization; distinguishes factors per case. Active/idle decomposition implicit but evident. Recommendations feasible/actionable, not vague.

- **Overall Strictness Penalty (-0.3 total)**: Tiny inconsistencies (104 grouping, rounding) prevent 10.0—hypercritical deduction for any non-flawless element. Still exceptionally high as conclusions are analytically rigorous, evidence-based, and professional.
