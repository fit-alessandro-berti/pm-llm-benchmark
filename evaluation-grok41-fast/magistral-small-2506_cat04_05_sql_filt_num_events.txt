The provided SQL query is correct, efficient, and precisely matches the requirements. It uses a CTE to identify `case_id`s with 6 events via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then joins back to retrieve all events (`el.*`) from only those cases, excluding any with >6 events. The optional `ORDER BY` is logical given the table structure and does not alter correctness. The explanation accurately describes the logic without errors. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws.
