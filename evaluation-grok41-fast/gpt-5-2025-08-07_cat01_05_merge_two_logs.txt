**9.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
**Strengths (supporting high score):**
- **Comprehensive merging and enrichment**: All events from both logs are accounted for. Merged events correctly combine attributes (e.g., user_id, resource_id, notes from B; event types/timestamps from both). Unique events (Quality Check B-only, Item Delivered A-only) preserved with origin flags and appropriate empties. Unified names are logically normalized (e.g., OrderReceived  Order Received; Shipping  Item Shipped), favoring clearer A's terms while preserving originals.
- **Chronological ordering**: Perfectly sorted by primary_timestamp (A's where available, source's otherwise), resulting in logical sequence: Received  Validated  Payment  Quality Check  Shipped  Delivered.
- **Output structure**: CSV format is structured, readable, and exceeds basic "list" expectation with useful extras (origin, both timestamps, delta_seconds). Enriched beyond minimum.
- **Reasoning quality**: Thorough, explicit on matches (with exact deltas), non-matches, name mapping, primary TS choice (A as instructed), and conflict resolution (e.g., B notes explaining skew). Documents tolerance decisions transparently.
- **Fidelity to context**: Treats A as primary timeline; handles offsets (few seconds/ms); inserts non-overlapping events correctly.

**Flaws/Deductions (strict/hypercritical; each minor issue docks ~0.2-0.5):**
- **Tolerance violations (-0.5)**: Prompt specifies "<2 seconds" (strictly less than) as matching criterion/example. Merges at *exactly* 2s (Received: 2s; Shipped: 2s) and *5s* (Payment) exceed this. Reasoning admits "exceeding nominal 2s" but merges Payment anyway based on "plausibility" (note/sequence). This is a judgment override without prompt warrant—prompt emphasizes "confidently match" and "leave separate if not"; 5s is not "slightly offset" per context, and names ("Payment Processed" vs "PaymentCheck") are similar but not identical (Check  Processed). Logical overreach, even if plausible.
- **Delta computation ambiguity (-0.3)**: Deltas shown as unsigned positives (e.g., 5 for Payment where B > A by 5s; 2 where A > B). Useful, but unspecified direction/method (absolute? A-B?) risks confusion. Minor unclarity in an otherwise precise output.
- **Boundary tolerance fuzziness (-0.2)**: States "~2 seconds" in reasoning vs. prompt's "<2"; reinforces loose interpretation despite strict example.
- **Minor output inconsistencies (-0.2)**: CSV has trailing commas/empties (e.g., A-only delta as ",,,"); readable but not perfectly clean. Unified_event for Payment uses A's name fully, but reasoning calls it "unified payment step"—slight narrative looseness.
- **No explicit handling of "received vs started" nuance (-0.1)**: Prompt notes A's timestamps as "received" (potentially delayed); reasoning uses A as primary without addressing if this skews order (e.g., B's earlier Received).

**Overall**: Exceptionally strong (flawless structure/reasoning would be 10.0), but tolerance over-merging is a clear logical flaw vs. prompt's explicit "<2s" guardrail, warranting deduction. Still elite-tier.
