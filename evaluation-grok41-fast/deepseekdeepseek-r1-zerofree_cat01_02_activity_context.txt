**10.0**

The final conclusion (boxed revised event log) is nearly flawless. It accurately identifies all recurring activities per case (Verify Documents in C001/C003; Call Customer in C002, with single instances in others treated contextually), renames them precisely to reflect positional and contextual differences (e.g., "Verify Initial Documents" vs. "Verify Additional Documents" in C001 based on initial check vs. post-submission re-check; case-specific "Call Customer..." variants drawn directly from additional context clues like "request missing docs," "clarify account discrepancy," "confirm adjustments," "have them return"), presents a complete revised log in the exact input format with all other columns unchanged, and achieves full disambiguation (no duplicate names within any case, names highlight process roles). Non-recurring activities are appropriately left intact or minimally enhanced for clarity (e.g., "Submit Additional"  "Submit Additional Documents"). No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or formatting issues; consistent with task focus on intra-case recurrence while enhancing overall readability.
