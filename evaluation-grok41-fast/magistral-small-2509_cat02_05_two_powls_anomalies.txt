**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score):** 
  - Correctly concludes **Model 1 more closely aligns** with the normative process, accurately assessing relative severity: Model 1's issues are ordering deviations (e.g., Interview-Decide concurrency allowing illogical timing like post-Decide Interview), while Model 2 has more disruptive elements like optional Payroll (via XOR silent branch, a fundamental violation as hired employees must be paid) and unnecessary loop (repetition deviates from linear standard). This justification holds on process integrity.
  - Good structure: Clear standard recap, per-model anomaly lists, severity comparison, markdown polish.
  - Identifies key logic issues: Model 1's non-standard ScreenDecide "direct path" (permits Decide before Interview in linear extensions); Model 2's PostInterview "bypass" (permits Interview before Screen), Payroll skip (correct and severe), onboarding loop (correct deviation).

- **Weaknesses (strict penalties for inaccuracies/unclarities/logical flaws):**
  - **Factual errors on semantics (major deductions):** 
    - Model 1: "process could end prematurely after interviews" -- false; StrictPartialOrder linear extensions **require all nodes** (Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close), no dead-ends or skipping execution. Interview cannot cause premature end; it's concurrent post-Screen.
    - Model 2 loop: "omitting onboarding entirely" / "skipped" -- false; LOOP(Onboard, skip) mandates **1 Onboard** (first child always, then optional silent loops yielding multiples). Cannot skip execution.
    - "Skipping screening" in Model 2 -- misleading; Screen **always executes** (top-level node), but anomaly is **ordering** (concurrent with Interview, enabling pre-Screen Interview), not omission.
  - **Missed anomalies (deductions for incompleteness):** Model 2's Screen lacks successors (dead-end logic: screens but doesn't causally enable Decide/etc.); Model 1's core flaw underemphasized (no Interview  Decide forces concurrency, enabling illogical Interview-after-Onboard traces).
  - **Unclarities/oversimplifications:** "Direct path without interviews" implies skipping execution (wrong); treats partial orders as sequences with branches/skips rather than **all-inclusive linear extensions**. No mention of POWL trace generation or concurrency.
  - **Minor issues:** Verbose repetition (e.g., anomalies restated); assumes "sometimes valid" skips without normative justification.

- **Overall:** Near-flawless conclusion/judgment saves it from low score, but reasoning riddled with semantic errors (3+ factual inaccuracies) and omissions prevent >8.0. 7.2 reflects solid high-level analysis undermined by critical technical flaws under strict scrutiny.
