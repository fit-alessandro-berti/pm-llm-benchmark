**Grade: 7.2**

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score):**
  - **Anomaly Identification (8/10):** Correctly spots key deviations for cases 1002 (shipment before checks), 1003 (ship before confirm), and 1004 (early payment before invoice, scheduled=N despite shipping). Ties well to normal flow. Structure with bullets/cases is clear.
  - **Hypotheses (8.5/10):** Plausible and varied (system errors, human error, manual bypass, fraud, non-compliance, logging lags). Matches prompt examples (system errors, policy violations, training issues).
  - **SQL Queries (9.5/10):** Excellent – multiple targeted, syntactically correct PostgreSQL queries using proper self-joins on `case_id` and timestamp comparisons. Directly investigate identified issues (e.g., ship before confirm, payment before invoice, post-ship checks). Includes extras like resource checks and additional_info parsing. Markdown formatting enhances clarity. Mentions potential `orders`/`resources` integration (notes section).
  - **Overall Structure/Clarity (9/10):** Logical sections, disclaimers appropriate (non-intrusive), final notes on refinement. No verbosity in conclusions.

- **Flaws/Deductions (Strict Penalties):**
  - **Factual Inaccuracy in Anomaly Description (-1.5):** For case 1004, explicitly states "“Confirm Shipment” (id:24) is logged after “Ship Goods” (id:25)" – **false**. Timestamps: Confirm Shipment (09:25:00) *precedes* Ship Goods (09:50:00). Propagates to hypothesis ("confirming shipment after goods have been shipped"). This misrepresents a non-issue (sequence is correct) while the real anomaly is logical inconsistency (scheduled=N but shipped). Undermines credibility.
  - **Missed Anomalies (-0.8):** Ignores completely skipped steps, e.g.:
    - Case 1004: No "Perform Credit Check" or "Validate Stock" at all.
    - Case 1003: No "Validate Stock".
    These are major deviations from normal flow; no queries detect missing events (e.g., `NOT EXISTS` for expected activities per case).
  - **Incomplete Use of Tables (-0.3):** Mentions `orders`/`resources` optionally but no actual queries (e.g., correlate high `order_value` with anomalies, join `resources.role` for role violations in shipment). Prompt allows/encourages.
  - **Minor Unclarities/Over-Specificity (-0.3):** Query E assumes `FinanceTeam_%` pattern (works on data but brittle; better join to `resources`). Query for "immediate" events (mentioned) is basic `ORDER BY` – not investigative. Hypotheses speculative (e.g., "fraud") without query backing.
  - **No Advanced Sequence Analysis (-0.4):** Notes window functions/lateral joins possible but doesn't provide (e.g., LAG for prev_activity or ROW_NUMBER for expected order mismatches). Queries are pairwise good but not holistic.

- **Why Not Higher/Lower:** Nearly flawless queries/hypotheses push to 7+, but factual error + missed skips = not "nearly flawless" (strict rule). Below 7 would undervalue utility; above 8 ignores inaccuracies. Total: Comprehensive but flawed core analysis.
