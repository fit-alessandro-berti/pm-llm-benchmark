**10.0**

The answer is exemplary and nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It comprehensively groups all 15 events without omission or overlap (1-3 & 13-15: Idle; 4-6: Cutting; 7-8: Assembling; 9: Welding; 10-12: Inspection), accurately identifies sequential patterns with clear phase transitions (e.g., tool position progression 01015200 mm; flow 052010; temp/vib/energy spikes/drops), assigns intuitive labels directly matching prompt examples, and provides precise, data-driven rationales tied to specific sensor changes (e.g., vibration 30-38 Hz + flow 5 + tool movement for cutting; 80°C/5 kWh/50 Hz spike for welding). No inaccuracies (all interpretations logically derive from numeric patterns, e.g., no overreach on pressure), no unclarities (structure is explicit with summary + detailed sections), no logical flaws (single-event welding justified as "short-duration spike"; cooldown in 10 fits inspection grouping without forcing artificial splits). Exceeds requirements by noting cycle completion. Zero deductions warranted.
