**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: Exactly 20 questions. All are open-ended (starting with "What," "How," "In what ways"). Most are thought-provoking and reasonably tied to the BPMN (e.g., #1 on Taiwan risks, #4 on delays in parallel sourcing, #8 on exclusive gateway decisions, #9 on parallel freight split, #15/#16 on performance/stakeholder metrics). Covers specified categories adequately overall (risks: #1,4,19; improvements: #4,7,14,18; decision-making: #3,8; rationale: #2,3,5,6,9,11,13,20; communication: #5,16; measurement: #15,16).
- **Major Flaws (significant deductions)**:
  - **Disobeys "just list the questions"**: Adds unnecessary intro ("Certainly! Here are...") and closing sentence ("These questions aim to..."). This is a direct, clear violation—prompt demands *just* the list, no fluff. Equivalent to ignoring instructions (deduct 1.5 points).
  - **Inaccuracies/Off-topic questions** (not "based on" BPMN):
    | Question | Issue |
    |----------|-------|
    | #12 | Sustainability *not mentioned anywhere* in BPMN. Pure invention/extrapolation; doesn't delve into *given* process flows. |
    | #17 | Customer feedback loop *not in BPMN* (market research is one-way start; no explicit iteration from sales/end). Logical stretch, assumes unstated process. |
    These undermine "delve deeper into the [given] process" (deduct 0.8 points total).
- **Minor Flaws/Unclarities/Logical Issues (further deductions)**:
  - #2: "Continually aligned" implies feedback loop not shown (sequential tasks only); slightly speculative.
  - #11/#13: Vague on "tailored"/"optimized"—probes rationale but lacks precision tying to BPMN's parallel splits/joins.
  - #20: Overly general ("transparent and accountable at each stage"); doesn't specify gateways/tasks deeply.
  - No logical contradictions, but lacks *depth* in some (e.g., #6 on 24/7 ignores Malaysia-specific BPMN context like shipping prior).
  - Cumulative minors: Shallow probing in 4/20 questions (deduct 0.5 points).
- **Overall**: Strong content (80% flawless) but instructions broken + 2 inaccurate questions + minors = far from "nearly flawless." Strict scaling: 10.0 = zero issues; each flaw cascades down.
