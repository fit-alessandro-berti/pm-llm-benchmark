**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This grading is conducted with utmost strictness per instructions: every inaccuracy, unclarity, logical flaw, or deviation from the task (even minor) incurs significant deduction. Only ~9.5+ for near-perfection (complete, precise, no flaws). The answer is strong overall—comprehensive structure, correct core identifications, good explanations, and fulfills all 3 tasks—but deducts for multiple non-minor issues detailed below. Base score started at 10, deducted stepwise.

#### Strengths (Supporting High Base):
- **Task 1 (Normative Violations)**: Correctly IDs only Case 2 as violating (Cases 1/3 clean). Explains 2/3 key violations clearly (Risk before Credit; Finalize after reject). Notes closing after invalid step.
- **Task 2 (Desiderata)**: Accurately IDs failures (Case 3: all 3; Case 1: 1; Case 2: secondary to normative). Clarifies "not serious/suboptimal" repeatedly.
- **Task 3 (Interpretations/Justifications)**: Done well—"in line with constraints" by dismissing invalid excuses for Case 2 violations, providing plausible (non-violating) real-world explanations for Case 3 delays/no follow-up.
- Structure: Clear sections, tables for readability, summary table aligns.
- Extras (recommendations): Unasked but non-harmful/insightful; minor positive.

#### Deductions (Logical/Accuracy/Unclarity Flaws, Significant Each):
- **-0.8: Incomplete Normative Violations Listing (Major Inaccuracy)**: Case 2 has **3 clear normative violations** (1. Risk Assessment *before* Credit Check [ordering]; 2. **No Inform Applicant at all** [skipped mandatory step post-Decision, required regardless of approve/reject]; 3. Finalize Documentation after reject [contradictory logic]). Lists only 2 explicitly in Case 2 normative section; buries #2 as "normative" in *desiderata* subsection. Task requires "explain the reasons"—omission makes analysis incomplete, understates severity (#2 is explicit sequence skip: "Loan Decision  Inform Applicant").
- **-0.6: Misleading Table in Case 3 Normative Section (Major Unclarity/Logical Flaw)**: Timestamps listed without dates (e.g., Inform "15:00"  Finalize "09:00"  Close "10:00"). Numerically implies reverse order (Finalize/Close *before* Inform), risking reader inferring normative violation (Decision  Inform  Finalize broken). Original log needs dates for multi-day spans; abbreviation creates confusion despite correct verbal checks. Hypercritical: presentation flaw undermines credibility.
- **-0.2: Minor Inconsistency in Case 1 Desiderata Phrasing**: Calls it "Fully Meets Desiderata (Best Practice)" then qualifies "meets all except follow-up... not a violation." Slight contradiction ("fully" vs. "except"); follow-up *is* a desideratum failure (recommended/encouraged), even if mild.
- **-0.1: Case 2 Desiderata Redundancy**: Assesses timing despite "already non-compliant" (ok for completeness), but frames missing Inform as "not just desiderata" correctly—yet dilutes Task 2 focus by mixing with normative.
- **-0.1: Unasked Extras**: Recommendations/Final Verdict/ "Bottom Line" add value but deviate from exact tasks (1-3 only); minor bloat.

#### Overall Justification for 8.2:
- **~85% flawless**: Covers all tasks substantively, precise calculations (e.g., 49h/51h delays), no factual errors in facts/logic core, excellent severity distinction (normative=serious vs. desiderata=suboptimal). Flaws are not catastrophic (violations still ID'd, just incompletely; table fixable) but "significantly lower" per strictness for analysis gaps/unclarity. Higher (9+) needs zero such issues. Lower (e.g., 7-) if flaws were more pervasive/misidentified cases.
