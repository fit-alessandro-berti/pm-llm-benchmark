**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—concise, structured, data-driven, and directly addresses the question with precise evidence from the logs. It correctly identifies **Group B's log** as exhibiting bias (via the boosts absent in Group A), explains manifestation through attributes/ScoreAdjustment, and links to systematic differences (disparate treatment/impact). Calculations (e.g., averages: Group A approved prelim avg (720+740)/2=730; Group B (720+695)/2=707.5 ), comparisons (705 adjusted approved vs. 710 rejected), and counterfactual are spot-on and insightful. Terminology (e.g., "effective thresholds," "disparate treatment/impact") is precise and relevant to bias analysis.

**Minor deductions (-0.8 total, per strict criteria):**
- **Imprecision in phrasing ( -0.3 )**: "Identify which log exhibits bias"  Answer says "bias shows up in Group B’s processing." This is accurate (bias manifests in B's unequal boosts), but hypercritically, it's not explicit enough as "Group B's log exhibits bias **against Group A**" or "bias favoring Group B over A." Subtle unclarity in directly naming the log.
- **Minor overgeneralization (-0.2)**: "Group A: ScoreAdjustment = 0 for all cases." True for most rows, but ManualReview rows show "N/A" (no adjustment applied). Functionally correct, but not pixel-perfect to table.
- **Assumptive threshold (-0.3)**: "implied cutoff around 715–720" and "lower effective cutoff" are logically inferred (e.g., 710 rej  720 app), but U003's 705 adjusted approved vs. 710 rej highlights inconsistency *better explained by boost overriding threshold* than a vague "715–720." Minor logical stretch, though evidence supports it.

No major inaccuracies, logical flaws, or omissions (covers all required elements: logs comparison, attributes, ScoreAdjustment, systematic differences). Far exceeds "good"—nearly flawless for max score, but strictness demands docking for nitpicks.
