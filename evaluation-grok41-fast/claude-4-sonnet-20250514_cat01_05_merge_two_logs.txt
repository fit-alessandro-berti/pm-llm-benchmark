### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is excellent in structure, completeness, and utility—clear strategy, per-event reasoning, chronological output with enriched attributes, preservation of all data, and summary stats. It faithfully follows the prompt's requirements for merging (semantic + timing), handling uniques, documentation, and chronological ordering using a consistent primary timestamp logic (Log A preferred). The invented CSV format is intuitive, includes both timestamps where relevant, sources, and all attributes without loss. Reasoning is logical and explicit.

However, deducting 0.8 total for minor-to-moderate issues under utmost strictness:
- **Tolerance application inaccuracy (deduct 0.3)**: Prompt specifies "<2 seconds" (strictly less than); answer merges exactly 2s diffs (Order Received: exactly 2s; Shipping: exactly 2s) while claiming "~2s tolerance." Strategy phrasing "Timestamp difference  2 seconds" is malformed/unclear (double space, no operator like "<" or ""). Hypercritical view: violates prompt's example precisely, even if pragmatically reasonable.
- **Payment events logic questionable (deduct 0.3)**: 5s diff is within prompt's "slightly offset by a few seconds"; semantic match ("Payment Processed" vs. "PaymentCheck") is as strong as merged pairs (e.g., "Order Received"/"OrderReceived"); "gateway delay" note *explains* the offset, suggesting same occurrence rather than "different stages." Separating creates redundant near-duplicate events without strong evidence; prompt prioritizes merging "where possible" on "combination of ... timing." Reasonable but not optimal/confident.
- **Minor unclarities/typos (deduct 0.1)**: Strategy sentence incomplete; "at tolerance boundary" admits ambiguity; summary "Merge rate: 60% of Log A events successfully merged" uses subjective "successfully" and asymmetric metric (ignores Log B).
- **Tiny format nit (deduct 0.1)**: For Log B-only events, "timestamp_primary" header misleads slightly (it's actually Log B ts, not "primary" Log A); should clarify or use "timestamp" universally.

No major flaws (e.g., no data loss, wrong order, ignored events, poor chrono sort). Handles naming/attributes perfectly (Log A precedence explicit). Very high score earned—nearly flawless for a complex task—but strict deductions for the above prevent 10.0.
