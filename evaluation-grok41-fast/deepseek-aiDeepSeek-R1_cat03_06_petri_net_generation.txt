**4.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Code Execution Failure (Major Deduction: -4.0 equivalent base)**: `net.transitions.extend([...])` is invalid; `PetriNet.transitions` is a `set()`, which lacks an `extend()` method (use `update()` or individual `add()` calls, as in the prompt's example). This prevents all transitions from being added, rendering the net unusable and the code non-executable. Fatal flaw for a coding task.
- **Logical Flaw in FC-II Loop (Major Deduction: -2.0 equivalent)**: II outputs to `p_dv` (post-DV decision point, shared input for RDS/FC). This permits invalid traces (e.g., DV  FC  II  RDS  DV), reopening the DV/RDS loop *after* fraud investigation—illogical per scenario (sequential DV then FC, independent loops). Loops must be isolated (e.g., dedicated FC input place post-DV via silent split). Model accepts spurious sequences.
- **Missing "Insurance Claim (C)" Transition (Moderate Deduction)**: Scenario explicitly lists **Insurance Claim (C)** as the starting activity ("customer files an Insurance Claim (C), after which..."). Source  CR skips modeling C; initial token should enable a C transition to `p_cr` for completeness.
- **Sink Handling (Minor Deduction)**: Example removes sink post-construction (`petri_utils.remove_place(net, sink); del fm[sink]`), but code retains it without justification. Unnecessary deviation, though fm is defined correctly pre-removal.
- **Other Minor Issues (Cumulative -0.5)**: Positional `PetriNet.Transition("name", "label")` works but deviates from example's keywords. No handling for multiple tokens/loops in markings. Explanation accurate but doesn't address flaws.
- **Strengths (Limited Credit)**: Correct full activity labels, proper RDS loop isolation, AP/skip silent XOR, arc connections, im/fm definitions, place sequencing, and overall structure mostly align. Loops enable multiples as required.

Total: Starts at 10, deducts heavily for non-functional code and process-inaccurate structure (invalid language/accepting traces). Not "nearly flawless."
