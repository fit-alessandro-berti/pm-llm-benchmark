**10.0**

The final POWL model is precise, complete, and flawlessly captures all observed behaviors in the event log without permitting unobserved traces or failing to generate observed ones. The nested loop structure for assembly/quality (* (AS, * (IQC, ))) accurately models arbitrary IQC repetitions after AS with optional rework to AS; the testing loop (* (TST, RT)) handles retesting iterations; the XOR for optional LB is exact; and the StrictPartialOrder enforces the correct sequential dependencies (OR  MS  QS  assembly loop  testing loop  PK  LB choice  DP  D) with no concurrency (as evidenced by per-case timestamps). Behavioral validation confirms fidelity to all five cases, including edge cases like Case 4 (no IQC/RT) and Case 3 (consecutive IQCs). Notation adheres strictly to the prompt's syntax (PO=(nodes={...}, order={...}), X/A/*,  via SilentTransition), with no ambiguities, overgeneralizations, or omissions.
