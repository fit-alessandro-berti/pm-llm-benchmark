**6.0**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Anomalies correctly identified across cases 1002-1004 with precise references to sequences and misses (e.g., shipments before checks, payment before invoice). Hypotheses are logical, varied (system, human, fraud), and tied to data (e.g., priority orders, rapid payment). Most SQL queries (2-5) are executable, schema-compliant, relevant to hypotheses, and would surface issues: Query 2 flags missing steps (catches 1004), Query 3 flags rapid payments (catches 1004), Query 4 validates roles/depts (preventive/useful), Query 5 spots workloads (e.g., FinanceTeam_02 across cases). Uses appropriate PostgreSQL features (LAG, EXTRACT, INTERVAL, LEFT JOIN).
  
- **Critical Flaws (major deductions)**:
  - **Query 1 is fundamentally broken and misleading**: Purpose claims detection of "shipment confirmation occurs after shipping, payment before invoicing, or credit check after shipment". But LAG-based WHERE fails on data:
    | Anomaly | Does it catch? | Reason |
    |---------|----------------|--------|
    | 1003 (Confirm Shipment after Ship Goods) | No | Prev to Confirm is 'Issue Invoice' (event 18), not 'Ship Goods'. Non-consecutive. |
    | 1002 (Credit Check after Confirm/Ship) | No | Prev to Credit Check is 'Ship Goods' (event 10), not 'Confirm Shipment'. Condition mismatch. |
    | Only catches 1004's Invoice after Payment (consecutive). |
    This renders it ineffective for primary sequence anomalies (out-of-order core issue). Logical design flaw: LAG assumes immediate precedence; real violations are non-adjacent. No correction or alternative (e.g., MIN/MAX timestamps per activity). Claims overreach accuracy.
  - **Incomplete sequence coverage**: No query properly detects non-consecutive violations (e.g., Ship Goods timestamp < Perform Credit Check timestamp via subqueries/CASE). Relies on flawed Query 1.
  - **Minor unclarities/incompletenesses**: Query 5 hardcodes dates to sample (not general); doesn't tie back strongly to anomalies (e.g., no filter for anomalous cases). No query for Validate Stock after Ship (1002 anomaly). Hypotheses mention "priority" correlation but Queries 2/3 only group/show it, not test (e.g., no WHERE order_type='priority').
  - **Overall**: ~80% solid (analysis/hypotheses/4 queries), but central sequence query's inaccuracy + missed patterns = not "nearly flawless." Strict penalty for logical/SQL errors in investigation core.
