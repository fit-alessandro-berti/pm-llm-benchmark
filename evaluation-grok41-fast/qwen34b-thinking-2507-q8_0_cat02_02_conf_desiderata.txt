**7.0**

### Explanation of Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**: 
  - Perfect structure mirroring the task (sections 1,2,3 explicitly; tables for clarity; summary table).
  - Flawless distinction between normative (strict, no justification) vs. desiderata (suboptimal, justifiable with real-world examples).
  - Correctly identifies Case 1 as fully compliant, Case 3 as only desiderata issues (precise timestamps, 3 issues noted accurately).
  - Case 2 normative violations correctly detailed with timestamps, rule quotes, and "no justification" emphasis (sequence reversal and post-rejection finalize are spot-on, matching log annotations).
  - Justifications table is excellent: realistic suggestions (e.g., system bug, backlogs) without excusing strict violations.
  - Key takeaways and adherence to constraints flawless; no overreach or assumptions.

- **Fatal Flaws (Strict Deductions, Preventing 9-10)**:
  - **Major Inaccuracy (Primary Penalty: -2.0)**: Completely misses a clear **third normative violation in Case 2**—**no "Inform Applicant" activity at all after Loan Decision (Rejected at 09:30), before Finalize/Close**. 
    - Rules explicitly state: "Following the loan decision, the applicant **must be informed** of the outcome." "Inform Applicant **must occur after Loan Decision**." Sequence requires it before branch/Close. "Not Allowed: Skipping activities."
    - This is a **skipped mandatory step** (like the annotated violations), making Case 2 have **3 violations**, not 2. Explicitly states "2 violations" in table/summary—logically flawed and incomplete for Task 1.
  - **Minor Unclarity/Imprecision (-0.5)**: Desiderata table formatting ("Jan 12  Jan 14") sloppy (missing "to"); Case 1 implicitly assumes no Follow-up Call desideratum violation (log doesn't show it, like Case 3 explicitly notes, but strict reading could flag absence across cases).
  - **Minor Overstatement (-0.5)**: Case 2 Credit Check "too late, but not the main issue" (in <think>, but final ignores); final answer doesn't dwell, but implies only 2 issues total.

- **Why Not Lower?** 70%+ coverage of violations (2/3 correct), plus near-perfect execution elsewhere (distinction, justifications, tables) prevents sub-7.0. **Why Not Higher?** Missing a core violation is not "nearly flawless"—hypercritical strictness demands 100% accuracy on identification/explanation (Task 1), no excuses for oversight despite excellent prose/structure.
