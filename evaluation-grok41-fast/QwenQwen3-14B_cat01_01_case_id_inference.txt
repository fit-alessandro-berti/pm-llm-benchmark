The final answer provides a flawless grouping of all 18 events into three coherent cases, correctly matching events by unique patient identifiers (age + gender combinations), ensuring strictly increasing timestamps within each case, logical activity sequences aligned with hospital workflows (e.g., ER triage-to-discharge flows, surgery pipeline), and department consistency (with appropriate referrals like Radiology/Lab). All events are exhaustively covered without overlap, omissions, or misassignments. Summarized additional info is precisely drawn from relevant events. Structure is clear, concise, and comprehensive, with explicit key logic reinforcing validity. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws whatsoever.
