### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Analysis)
This solution is **extremely strong** and nearly flawless in logic, structure, and correctness, warranting a very high score. It precisely captures "direct succession" via consecutive `ROW_NUMBER()` joins, correctly identifies cases with **at least one** qualifying sequence and timing violation (handling multiples elegantly), and excludes entire cases as required. DuckDB syntax is spot-on (e.g., `INTERVAL '5 days'`, datetime subtraction). CTEs are efficient, readable, and scalable. Explanation is thorough, accurate, and addresses edge cases.

#### Minor Deductions (Hypercritical Lens, Total -0.8):
1. **SELECT columns (-0.5)**: Selects only `case_id, activity, timestamp` instead of `SELECT *`. Prompt specifies "all events from `event_log`" (table has **at least** these columns, implying possible others like `user_id` or `resource`). This produces incomplete rows if extra columns exist—**not "all events"**. `SELECT *` is required for exact spec compliance. Minor but disqualifying under strictness.
2. **Unnecessary DISTINCT (-0.1)**: Works but redundant; `cases_to_exclude` implicitly dedupes `case_id`. Adds no value, slight inefficiency/clutter.
3. **No tiebreaker in ROW_NUMBER() (-0.1)**: `ORDER BY timestamp` alone risks nondeterministic `rn` if timestamp ties (possible in logs). Should be `ORDER BY timestamp, some_id ASC` (e.g., auto-increment). Unlikely but logical gap.
4. **Ordering not mandated (+0 but noted)**: Adds `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp`—helpful but unspecified; no deduction.

#### Why Not 10.0?
No single-issue perfection under "utmost strictness." Column omission is a clear inaccuracy (not "all events"). Fixes would be trivial:
```sql
-- Final SELECT fix
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```
-- ROW_NUMBER fix: `ORDER BY timestamp, rowid` (DuckDB has `rowid`).

#### Strengths (Flawless Aspects):
- **Core logic**: Perfect 3-way join on `rn +1` enforces **exact succession** (no interleaving).
- **Timing filter**: Correctly applies **per-sequence** (>5 days on **that** CreateConfirm pair); excludes if **any** qualifies.
- **Multi-sequence handling**: Captures existence correctly (case excluded on first bad triplet).
- **Performance**: Linear scans, no unnecessary groups/aggs.
- **Completeness**: Returns **only** non-qualifying cases' events; no leakage.
- **Explanation**: Precise, proactive on edges (multiples, ordering, arithmetic).
