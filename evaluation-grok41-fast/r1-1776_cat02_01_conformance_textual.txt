The provided answer is exemplary: it precisely identifies the correct violating cases (2, 3, and 5) with no omissions or errors; offers clear, accurate explanations directly tied to the normative text's rules and constraints (e.g., order dependencies, prohibitions like shipping post-cancellation, implied sufficiency logic); interprets ambiguities logically and conservatively (e.g., authorization implying sufficiency, mandatory sequencing without skips); confirms valid cases succinctly; and structures the response for maximum clarity without extraneous content or contradictions. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or minor issues whatsoever.
