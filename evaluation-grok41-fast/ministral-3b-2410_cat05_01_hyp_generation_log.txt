**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (minor, insufficient for high score):** Identifies some real deviations (e.g., out-of-order events in 1002/1004, missing credit check). Provides hypotheses (though generic). Structures response with sections and SQL code blocks. Attempts case-specific queries tied to observations.
  
- **Major Flaws (severe deductions):**
  - **Inaccurate anomaly identification (Anomaly 1):** "Delayed Payment" for case 1003 is **not anomalous**. Registration: 2024-02-01 08:45; payment: 2024-02-02 11:00 (~26.25 hours). Compare to "normal" 1001 (~4.5 days). This is *faster*, not delayed. Hypothesis ("backlog/policy violation") is baseless/misleading. SQL query is trivial (selects known row, adds no insight). Deduct 2+ points for factual error.
  - **Logical flaws in SQL queries (all three):**
    - Query 1: Pointless; filters redundantly on known data, ignores hypothesis (e.g., no join to `orders` for value/backlog correlation or aggregate delays across cases).
    - Query 2: **Broken logic**. Subquery `MIN(timestamp)` of listed activities = registration (08:20). Confirm Shipment (08:25) is *after*, so `< 08:20` returns **nothing**. Fails to detect "early" vs. prerequisites. Deduct 1.5+ points.
    - Query 3: **Broken for hypothesis**. No credit check in 1004  subquery returns NULL  `timestamp < NULL` is false  returns **nothing**. Doesn't detect missing events or "skipped" cases. Deduct 1.5+ points.
  - **Misses obvious/major anomalies (incomplete analysis):** Ignores glaring issues like:
    | Case | Key Anomalies Ignored |
    |------|-----------------------|
    | 1002 | Ship Goods *before* Credit Check/Validate Stock; Validate Stock *after* Ship Goods. |
    | 1003 | No Validate Stock; Ship Goods *before* Confirm Shipment. |
    | 1004 | No Credit Check/Validate Stock; Payment/*Invoice* before *any* logistics; `shipment_scheduled=N` but Ship Goods anyway; high-value (3000) order skips Finance gate. |
    No aggregate anomalies (e.g., % cases missing steps). Deduct 1.5 points.
  - **Shallow hypotheses:** All cite "system error/policy violation" repetitively. Ignores prompt examples (e.g., *training issues* for resources like LogisticsMgr doing pre-credit actions; no link to `resources.role/department` mismatches or `orders.order_value` for risk).
  - **No use of other tables:** Prompt explicitly allows `orders`/`resources`. Zero joins (e.g., high-value orders without credit check: `SELECT * FROM order_event_log oel LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.case_id=oel.case_id WHERE o.order_value > 2000 AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id=o.case_id AND activity='Perform Credit Check')`). Missed opportunity for deeper investigation. Deduct 1 point.
  - **Unclear/redundant structure:** "Event Log Data" shows only 1 row per anomaly (incomplete context). Repeats exact queries at end (redundant). No general queries to "investigate further" across cases (e.g., find *all* early payments).
  - **Minor issues (cumulative deductions):** No timestamps in observations for precision; ignores `additional_info` (e.g., credit_score=650 in 1002 post-shipment?); assumes flow rigidly without quantifying (e.g., no cycle time stats).

- **Overall:** Superficial, error-prone, incomplete. Covers ~30% of issues correctly but with fatal SQL/accuracy flaws. Not "nearly flawless" (far from 9-10); barely functional (not 1-2). Strict calibration: 3.2 reflects partial effort undermined by core failures.
