**8.0**

### Evaluation Summary
The answer is strong overall: perfect Python dictionary format (valid tuples, seconds units, syntactically correct), includes a representative subset of ~21 pairs (out of ~45 possible in a linear 10-activity sequence) with good complexity (direct like ('SS','OP'), short-skip like ('RC','CA'), long-range like ('SS','AS'), covering early-to-late, mid-to-end), realistic supply-chain estimates (e.g., 7-day delivery OPRC, 30-day DTAS), proportional stdevs (~25-50% of avg, sensible for variability), and helpful comments tying to business logic. Early-chain times are coherent and additive (e.g., SSPT = 14d exactly matches sum of intermediates: 1+7+1+2+3).

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, **logical inconsistencies in additivity severely undermine flawlessness**. In sequential traces, avg(AZ) *must* approximately equal sum of avg(A...Z) intermediates (as time(AZ) = sum segment times per trace, so averages add). Multiple violations:
- ('PT','DT') = 7d vs. ('PT','PK') 1d + ('PK','WS') 0.5d + ('WS','DT') 2d = **3.5d** (double the expected; ~100% error).
- ('PK','AS') = 45d vs. 0.5d + 2d + ('DT','AS') 30d = **32.5d** (~38% error).
- ('RC','DT') = 21d vs. RCPT ~6d + PTDT 7d = 13d (or +3.5d = 9.5d; ~62-120% error).
- ('CA','WS') = 6d vs. 3d + 1d + 0.5d = **4.5d** (~33% error).

These are not minor rounding/estimation errors (prompt has no data, but internal model must be coherent for "traces"); they indicate sloppy, non-physical estimates, especially post-PT inflation without justification. No reverse pairs or invalid orders, but incompleteness of some directs/skips (e.g., no ('QI','PT'), ('PT','WS')) is acceptable per "subset," yet amplifies reliance on inconsistent long pairs.

8.0 reflects excellence in structure/coverage/realism docked significantly (~2 points) for core logical flaws; not "nearly flawless" (would need 9.5-10.0). Minor positives (comments, units) don't offset.
