**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit basis):** 
  - Excellent structure mirroring the task's 1-2-3 parts, with clear subsections, bullet points, and a summary. Matches required outputs precisely.
  - Correctly identifies Case 2's two explicit normative violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection). Aligns with log annotations and constraints.
  - Correctly states no normative violations in Cases 1 and 3.
  - Desiderata section appropriately qualifies violations as non-severe ("while not a strict rule... recommended but not required"), identifies timing issues in Case 3 accurately, and notes absent Follow-up Calls across cases (logical, as logs show no such activity for any case, despite explicit note only on Case 3).
  - Task 3 (interpretations/justifications) is attempted for all cases, offering plausible, constraint-aligned explanations (e.g., "lack of training" for Case 2; "backlogs" for Case 3).
  - Summary is concise and accurate at a high level.

- **Major Inaccuracies/Flaws (significant deductions):**
  - **Critical miss in normative violations (Case 2):** Completely overlooks the absence of "Inform Applicant," a **strictly required step** ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; sequence mandates it after Loan Decision, before branching/closing; "no skipping activities"). Case 2 skips it entirely (Loan Decision  Finalize Documentation  Close Case), violating sequence, ordering, and "no skipping" rules. This is a blatant normative violation equivalent in severity to the caught ones, yet unmentioned in violations, desiderata, justifications, or summary. Hypercritical: this alone halves the score for Task 1 incompleteness.
  - **Logical flaw in desiderata scope:** Attributes Follow-up Call absence as a violation to Cases 1 and 2 without log evidence (only Case 3 explicitly notes it). While inferable (not logged = absent), this introduces minor overreach/unclarity; stricter reading ties desiderata explicitly to logged/annotated issues.
  - **Incomplete Task 3 depth:** Justifications are generic ("lack of training," "backlogs," "oversight") and fail to address the missed Inform skip or tie tightly to timestamps/constraints (e.g., no interpretation of Case 2's rapid but disordered timeline post-App Received). Does not "suggest interpretations... in line with the given constraints" exhaustively.

- **Minor Issues (further deductions):**
  - Desiderata timings precise but not calculated explicitly (e.g., Case 3: ~50+ hours from Loan Decision to Inform; unstated but implied correctly).
  - No suggestion for fixes/improvements in justifications, despite task encouraging "in line with... recommendations."
  - Hypercritical lens: No mention of Case 2's additional ordering ripple (Loan Decision arguably invalid without proper Credit  Risk sequence), amplifying under-analysis.

**Overall:** Strong format/content (80% solid) undermined by pivotal normative miss (equivalent to ~25-30% of analysis weight) and minor gaps. Not "nearly flawless"—flaws prevent >7.0. 6.0 reflects competent but critically incomplete work.
