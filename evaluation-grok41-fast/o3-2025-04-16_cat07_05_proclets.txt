**10.0**

The provided answer is exceptionally accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured. It precisely describes all elements of the three sub-figures (a), (b), and (c) with no omissions, errors, or misinterpretations:
- **Sub-figure (a)**: Correctly identifies processes, tasks, decision logic (including the loop), channels (Order system m0–m3; HIS m4–m7), flows (solid arcs for tokens, dashed for messages), roles (doctor, lab assistant, chemical analyst), and interactions.
- **Sub-figure (b)**: Accurately captures the cardinality ("Lab visit" 1..1 requires 1..* "Lab test").
- **Sub-figure (c)**: Matches the table verbatim (time, channel, sender/receivers with specifics like "HGB test for John", action/content/scope/direction).
- **Overall**: Insightful summary of collaboration without adding unsubstantiated details.

This is a model response—clear, concise, and expert-level.
