**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This grading is ruthlessly strict, deducting heavily for any inaccuracy, misinterpretation, unclarity, omission, logical inconsistency, or superficiality. A 10.0 requires near-perfection: exhaustive, precise mapping of *every* constraint to real-life implications, flawless DECLARE semantics, logical process flow without contradictions, and tight integration of all elements. Scores drop sharply for flaws (e.g., >0.5 deduction per major error, 0.1-0.3 per minor).

#### Strengths (Supporting ~8.0 Baseline):
- **Structure and Coverage**: Well-organized (impression, activities, constraints, interplay, goals/regs, conclusion). Addresses core question elements: real-life meanings, compliance/quality/structure, interplay (e.g., exactly_one for B, QA mandate), speculation (risk mgmt, regs like ECOA/TILA).
- **Practical Insights**: Good real-life mappings (e.g., A as intake, B as credit score, C as docs). Ties constraints to compliance (e.g., existence/absence prevent skips/fraud), transparency (auditability), efficiency.
- **Interplay Discussion**: Hits key examples (exactly_once B, rigid order). Speculates credibly on business/regulatory drivers with specifics (CFPB, AML).
- **No Major Off-Topic**: Stays focused, no criminality/fluff.

#### Major Deductions (-0.8 Total):
- **Inaccurate Constraint Interpretations** (Severe, -0.5): 
  - Chainprecedence: Model has F (Authorize)  B (Preliminary), meaning *F precedes B*. Answer reverses to "Preliminary Credit Check *must* have preceded the Authorization" – direct contradiction, undermines logical flow.
  - Noncoexistence G (Transfer)  A (Receive): DECLARE noncoexistence(A,B) means *neither both occur* (invalid if both in trace). Answer twists to "cannot transfer funds...before application received" (implies order, not mutual exclusion) – wrong semantics, illogical for valid process.
  - Chainresponse D  G: Answer notes but trails off ("follow...but not directly") – incomplete/unclear.
- **Logical Flaws in Sequence** (-0.2): Implied flow (ABCDEFGH) ignores model oddities (e.g., chainsuccession ED: QA *before* Assemble? Altprecedence HG ok, but chainprecedence FB breaks early credit check). Doesn't flag/analyze potential "negative" constraints (model may encode invalid paths), speculates coherent flow despite mismatches.
- **Omission of Constraints** (-0.1): Superficial on alts/non-variants (e.g., altresponse GH, altsuccession CE, nonsuccession HB, nonchainsuccession FH, altprecedence HG). Lumps as "relaxed/strict" without DECLARE specifics (alt=alternate paths?); ignores implications (e.g., H before G sensible, but ties to real-life?).

#### Minor Deductions (-0.3 Total):
- **Unclarities/Superficiality**: Alt/chain/non vaguely generalized ("more relaxed," "stricter") without precise DECLARE defs (response=eventual post-A; precedence=pre-A for every B; succession=immediate). Z (absence) mentioned but not interplay-integrated (e.g., vs. existence).
- **Incomplete Activity Ties**: D/E/F/G/H lack full constraint back-references (e.g., precedence EF, responded_existence DE, chainresponse DG).
- **Overgeneralization**: Speculation strong but untied to model (e.g., no link noncoexistence to AML fraud-prevention).
- **Minor Phrasing**: "Second pair of eyes" for E ok but casual; incomplete G sentence.

#### Why Not Lower/Higher?
- Not <7.0: Comprehensive (80% coverage), no egregious fabrications, useful analysis despite flaws.
- Not >7.5: Multiple factual errors (chainprecedence reversal core to precedence discussion), omissions leave ~25% model unanalyzed, logical process inconsistencies unaddressed. Not "nearly flawless."
