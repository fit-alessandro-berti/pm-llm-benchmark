**4.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
- **Major Logical Flaw in Grouping (Primary Deduction: -4.0 points):** The "Quality Inspection" group combines "Measure weld integrity" (immediately post-assembly, e.g., 08:01:20) with "Visual check" (final event post-coating, e.g., 08:02:00). These are **not temporally close**, **not by similar resources** (Quality Sensor #1 vs. Operator C), and **not logically coherent**—coating events interrupt them chronologically (08:01:30–08:01:45). This violates core instructions for "coherent stage[s]," "temporally close," and "logically follow from each other." The example for Case A1 exacerbates this by listing Quality Inspection's events non-consecutively while placing Coating *after* it in high-level sequence, misrepresenting the actual workflow order (measure  coating  visual). This inverts the process flow, undermining the goal of "higher-level process steps" for "understand[ing] the manufacturing workflow at a glance."
  
- **Inaccuracy in Rationales and Sequence (-1.0 point):** Coating rationale claims it "logically follow[s] the quality inspection phase," but their own grouping places visual (part of quality) *after* coating temporally/sequentially—inconsistent. Quality rationale vaguely lumps "automated measurements and manual checks" without addressing the phase gap or domain logic (weld-specific vs. final product check).

- **Minor Inaccuracies/Unclarities (-0.5 point):** Typo in Assembly rationale ("performing the *welts*" instead of "welds")—unprofessional and inaccurate. No explicit use of timestamps for justification despite prompt emphasis on temporal proximity. Groupings cover all events without overlap (positive), but no inference rules for "full log" or multi-case variations (prompt says "infer rules," patterns "consistent"—minor omission).

- **Strengths (Preventing Lower Score):** Structure matches request (per-group sections, table, example); names domain-relevant; most groups coherent (Prep, Assembly, Coating solid); all events aggregated; extra "Benefits" harmless/insightful.

Nearly flawless requires zero logical/process errors—**this has a fatal incoherence in core task (grouping/sequence), warranting low-mid score despite polish.**
