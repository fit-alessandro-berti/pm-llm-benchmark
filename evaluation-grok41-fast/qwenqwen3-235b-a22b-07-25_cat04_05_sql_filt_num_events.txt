The provided SQL query is correct, efficient, and precisely matches the requirements. It accurately identifies `case_id`s with 6 events via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`, then returns all events (`e.*`) from only those cases using an `INNER JOIN`, excluding any cases with >6 events. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws; it is fully deterministic, preserves all original event data for valid cases, and uses standard SQL compatible with DuckDB.
