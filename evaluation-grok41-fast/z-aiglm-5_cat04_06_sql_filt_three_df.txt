The provided SQL query is correct, complete, and precisely implements all requirements without any inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities. It accurately uses window functions (`LEAD`) to detect the exact sequence in direct succession per case (partitioned and ordered by `timestamp`), correctly identifies the >5-day interval between the specific events (`next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'`, valid DuckDB syntax), excludes entire matching cases via `DISTINCT case_id` and `NOT IN`, and returns all events (`SELECT *`) from non-matching cases. Edge cases (e.g., short cases, NULL `LEAD` values, multiple sequences per case) are inherently handled correctly. The optional `ORDER BY` enhances usability without violating specs. The explanation reinforces validity without errors. No penalties apply.
