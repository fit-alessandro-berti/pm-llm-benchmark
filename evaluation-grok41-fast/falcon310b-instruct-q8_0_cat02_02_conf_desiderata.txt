**7.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score):**
  - Correctly identifies Case 2 as the only normative violator and Case 3 as the only desiderata violator, aligning with the log.
  - Accurately explains the two noted normative violations in Case 2: (1) Risk Assessment before Credit Check (clear sequence breach), (2) Finalize Documentation after rejection (clear decision logic breach). Explanations reference constraints precisely.
  - Fully covers all explicit desiderata issues in Case 3 (delayed Credit Check >24h, delayed Inform >48h, no Follow-up Call), with proper clarification that they are "not serious" but "suboptimal."
  - Addresses part 3 with plausible justifications (e.g., human error, workload), though generic.
  - Excellent structure: Clear sections, bullet points, conclusion summarizing severity levels. Concise and professional.
  - Implicitly treats Case 1 as compliant (no violations mentioned, correct per log).

- **Flaws (deducting to 7.0, preventing 9-10 range):**
  - **Major inaccuracy (significant deduction):** Completely misses a clear normative violation in Case 2—the **skipped "Inform Applicant" step entirely**. The strict sequence mandates "Loan Decision  Inform Applicant" (text: "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; "must" language; "no skipping"). Log shows Decision (09:30)  Finalize (10:00)  Close (10:30), with no Inform entry (unlike Cases 1 and 3). This is a textbook "skipping activities" violation, equivalent in severity to the noted ones. Failing to identify/explain this makes task 1 incomplete (~33% of Case 2 violations missed), a logical flaw under "utmost strictness."
  - **Minor unclarities/logical gaps (further deductions):**
    - No explicit confirmation that Case 1 fully complies with both normative and desiderata (e.g., does Case 1 lack Follow-up Call? Log doesn't list it, similar to Case 3; explicit note only for Case 3, but hypercritically, should clarify/interpret). Implicit handling is acceptable but not flawless.
    - Desiderata explanations repeat "not serious/suboptimal" well but could tie more precisely to "recommended best practices" phrasing.
    - Justifications for part 3 (e.g., "system glitches") explain *why* violations occurred but weakly "in line with constraints" (task phrasing implies interpretations that might reconcile behaviors, not just post-hoc excuses). Not wrong, but superficial.
  - No outright contradictions or major unclarities, but the missed violation alone prevents "nearly flawless" (8+ requires comprehensiveness).

Overall: Strong, structured response covering ~85% perfectly, but the critical miss on a required step (obvious from log/sequence diagram) warrants deduction to mid-high range. Flawless would explicitly list all 3 Case 2 normative issues, confirm Case 1 compliance, and sharpen part 3.
