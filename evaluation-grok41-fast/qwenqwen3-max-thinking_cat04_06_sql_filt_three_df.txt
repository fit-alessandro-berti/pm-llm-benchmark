**10.0**

The provided SQL query and explanation are nearly flawless, fully satisfying all requirements with precise logic, correct DuckDB syntax, and robust handling of edge cases. 

- **Sequence detection**: Triple self-join with strict `timestamp >` ensures chronological order; `NOT EXISTS` subqueries perfectly enforce direct succession (no intervening events by timestamp), preventing false positives.
- **Timing filter**: `(e3.timestamp - e2.timestamp) > INTERVAL 5 DAYS` correctly identifies >5 days for the specific sequence pair, using native DuckDB interval arithmetic.
- **Exclusion**: `NOT IN` on `DISTINCT case_id` excludes entire cases matching *both* criteria, returning exactly the required events from non-matching cases.
- **Completeness**: `SELECT *` returns all columns/events; `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` ensures deterministic, log-like output without affecting logic.
- **Efficiency/robustness**: No unnecessary grouping; handles multiple sequences per case correctly (excludes if *any* qualifying triple exists); assumes standard event log properties (timestamps order events) without flaws.
- **Explanation**: Accurate, concise, and directly maps to requirements.

No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or minor issues detected—even under hypercritical scrutiny.
