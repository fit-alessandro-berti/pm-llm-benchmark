**10.0**

The answer is exceptionally accurate, complete, and insightful:
- **Perfect match** to the visualization: Correctly identifies all starting object types/volumes, activity nodes/volumes (e.g., Create Order 8.5M, Approve Requisition 5.7M), branches (procurement, fulfillment, returns), multiple Ends, edge labels (ms timings), and color-coding via lines/dots.
- **Structure & clarity**: Well-organized (sections for starts, activities, arrows, colors), concise yet comprehensive, with precise terminology ("multi-variant process flow map (directed graph)", "order-to-cash / procure-to-pay").
- **No errors/omissions**: Captures interconnections, variants, and summary purpose flawlessly.
