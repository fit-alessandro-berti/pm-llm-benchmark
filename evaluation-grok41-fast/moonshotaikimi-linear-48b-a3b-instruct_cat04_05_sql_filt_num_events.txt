The query is logically flawless, accurately implements the requirements with correct grouping (`GROUP BY case_id`), filtering (`HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` precisely excludes cases with >6 events), and returns the full event set (`SELECT *`) for qualifying cases. The `IN` subquery is efficient and idiomatic for this task in DuckDB. The added `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` is a minor enhancement (not required, but provides logical event log ordering without altering the result set), introducing no inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws. No deductions warranted under hypercritical scrutiny, as it is fully correct and complete.
