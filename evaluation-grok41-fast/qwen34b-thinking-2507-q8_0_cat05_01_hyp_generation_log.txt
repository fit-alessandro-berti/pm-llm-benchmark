**6.0**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: Anomalies are accurately identified (early Confirm Shipment in 1002, reversed Ship/Confirm in 1003, payment-before-invoice in 1004, missing validations in 1004), matching the data precisely. Hypotheses are plausible, varied, and tied to prompt examples (system errors, policy violations, manual bypasses, misconfigurations). Structure is clear, professional, and focused. Queries 2 and 3 are **flawless** PostgreSQL (correctly detect Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment and Receive Payment before Issue Invoice using timestamp comparisons). No unnecessary use of `resources` table; sticks to schema.
  
- **Fatal Flaws (strict deductions for inaccuracies/logical errors)**:
  1. **Query 1 logical inversion (major -2.0)**: SQL checks `Credit Check timestamp < Confirm Shipment timestamp` (normal flow), but anomaly requires the opposite (`Confirm Shipment < Credit Check`). Returns normal cases (e.g., 1001); fails to detect 1002. Text correctly describes "Confirm before Credit," but SQL contradicts it — core mismatch.
  2. **Query 4 broken logic/syntax (major -2.0)**: WHERE `oel.activity NOT IN (...) AND oel.activity IS NULL` filters out all cases with **any** events (e.g., 1004's 5 events fail `IS NULL`; NULL rows fail `NOT IN` due to NULL semantics). No results for missing activities. Proper aggregation/EXISTS needed (e.g., `HAVING COUNT(...) = 0` **without** the flawed WHERE). HAVING `OR` flags "at least one missing" (correct semantically), but unreachable due to WHERE.
  
- **Minor Flaws (further deductions -0.5 total)**: Query 1 ignores Stock Validation (anomaly mentions both). No query for additional anomalies (e.g., 1003 missing Validate Stock; 1004's Ship Goods despite `shipment_scheduled=N`). "Why these queries" section helpful but slightly verbose/repetitive.

Nearly flawless requires **all** SQLs executable and correct (they aren't). 6.0 reflects strong analysis/hypotheses offset by non-functional core queries.
