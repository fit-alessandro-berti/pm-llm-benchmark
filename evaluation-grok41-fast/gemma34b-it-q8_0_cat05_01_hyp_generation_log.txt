**9.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Hypercritical Assessment)
**Strengths (Supporting High Score):**
- **Perfect Alignment with Desired Output:** The structured response format (1. Description, 2. Hypothesis, 3. SQL Query) directly matches the target LLM's required behavior: identify anomalies, hypothesize causes, propose investigative SQL queries. "At least three" ensures depth without under-specifying.
- **No Improper Hints:** Faithfully adheres to "without any hints or guidance." No suggestions of specific anomalies (e.g., no mentions of out-of-sequence events, missing steps, or early payments). Relies solely on provided data/schema/normal flow for LLM discovery.
- **Complete Context Inclusion:** Instructs exact inclusion of schema (with normal flow), event logs, and reference tables—essential for analysis. Role-playing as "operational analyst" primes analytical mindset effectively.
- **Query Scope:** Explicitly allows `order_event_log` + optional `orders`/`resources`, matching requirements. Emphasis on "gather more data and confirm or refute" ensures investigative purpose.
- **Rationale Quality:** Concise, logical explanation of design choices reinforces intent without fluff. Covers role, structure, data, constraint—demonstrates understanding.
- **Engagement:** "Let's begin!" prompts action; constraint phrasing prevents LLM from meta-commentary.

**Flaws/Deductions (Strictly Penalized, Total -0.8):**
- **Placeholders Instead of Full Content (-0.4):** Schema/data sections use "(Include the schema description from the problem statement)" etc.—not a copy-pasted, ready-to-deploy prompt. Hypercritically, this makes it a *template*, not a complete "prompt designed to elicit." Minor usability flaw, but requires extra work to execute, reducing perfection.
- **Minor Phrasing Unclarity (-0.2):** "Do *not* provide any hints or guidance beyond the data provided" is slightly ambiguous—could be misread by target LLM as restricting *its* output (e.g., no explanatory text beyond query), though contextually it's about analysis bounds. Not a logical flaw, but not crystal-clear.
- **Overly Prescriptive Goal (-0.2):** "potential issues, anomalies, and areas of concern/ improvement" is spot-on but adds "areas for improvement," slightly broadening beyond strict "anomalies and undesirable behaviors." Logical stretch, though negligible in practice.

**Overall:** Nearly flawless—elite design that would reliably elicit precise, high-quality responses (e.g., detecting case 1002's skipped credit check pre-shipment, hypothesizing policy bypass, querying deviant sequences via LAG/LEAD or activity gaps). Deductions only for avoidable incompleteness/unclarity; anything less would be unjust. 10.0 reserved for zero-edit perfection.
