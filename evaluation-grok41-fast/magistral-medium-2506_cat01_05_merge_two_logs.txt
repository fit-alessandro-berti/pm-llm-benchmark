**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (Near-Flawless Aspects)**:
  - **Correct Matches**: All proposed merges are logically sound based on semantic similarity (e.g., "Order Received"/"OrderReceived", "Item Shipped"/"Shipping"), order_id match, and proximity. Unmatched events (Quality Check, Item Delivered) correctly identified and included with origin indication.
  - **Attribute Integration**: Perfect – all Log B attributes (user_id, resource_id, notes) added to merges; Log A-only events lack them appropriately; both timestamps preserved (primary Log A, secondary Log B).
  - **Chronology**: Final list/table/CSV perfectly sorted by primary timestamp (Log A for merges, native for unmatched). Self-corrected intermediate errors ignored per instructions.
  - **Output Formats**: Excellent – multiple views (numbered list, table, CSV) for clarity; CSV parseable and complete (empties handled correctly, e.g., `,,` for missing event types).
  - **Reasoning Documentation**: Comprehensive, step-by-step matching, conflict resolution (e.g., timestamp selection), mappings explicit. Covers all requirements.
  - **Handling Extras**: Origin field indicates sources; no data loss; enriched as required.

- **Minor Inaccuracies/Unclarities (Deductions)**:
  - **Tolerance Handling**: Prompt specifies "<2 seconds" (e.g.); answer stretches to 5s for Payment (10:02:00 vs. 10:02:05), admitting "beyond tolerance but likely same." Names ("Processed" vs. "Check") slightly diverge semantically (check  processed). Confident? Borderline – not "cannot confidently match." Also, 2s diffs (Order Received, Shipping) = exactly 2s, arguably not "<2s" strictly. Flexible interpretation reasonable (prompt says "e.g."), but explicit override reduces precision (-0.5).
  - **Event Name Presentation**: Inconsistent minorly – merged show "A / B", unmatched just name (ok per origin), but table omits dual for unmatched without sub-column clarity (-0.1).
  - **Verbose Repetition**: Final CSV repeats decisions already listed; not wrong, but slightly redundant (-0.1).
  - **No Over-Merging/Omissions**: No invented matches; all 10 events accounted for (4 merged + 2 unmatched = 6 records).

- **No Major Flaws**: No logical errors in final conclusions, no missing events, no incorrect sorting/order_id issues, no unhandled attributes. Self-corrections valid. Hypercritical lens finds only tolerance flex as quasi-violation (not egregious, documented). 9.2 reflects "nearly flawless" – deducts just enough for strict spec adherence. 10.0 requires zero subjectivity on tolerance.
