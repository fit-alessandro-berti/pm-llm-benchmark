**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**:
  - **Complete Coverage**: All 10 events from both logs (5A + 5B) are accounted for in 6 merged/separate records. No omissions or inventions.
  - **Chronological Order**: Correctly sorted using primary (Log A) timestamps for merged events and original for uniques (e.g., Quality Check at 10:03:00Z slots perfectly).
  - **Enrichment & Format**: Attributes integrated seamlessly (e.g., user_id, resource_id, notes from B; "—" for missing). Table format is clear, professional, with Source(s) column explicitly indicating origins as required.
  - **Reasoning Documentation**: Exhaustive per-event breakdown, including time diffs, semantic mappings (e.g., "PaymentCheck"  "Payment Processed"), and rules (primary ts from A). Summary table and ambiguities section fulfill "document your reasoning" perfectly. Conflicts (naming, offsets) resolved transparently.
  - **Primary Timeline Adherence**: Log A timestamps used consistently for merged events, as specified.
  - **Unmatched Handling**: Quality Check (B-only, no close A match) and Item Delivered (A-only) correctly separated with origins noted.

- **Flaws & Deductions (Strict Penalties)**:
  - **Tolerance Violation (Major Logical Flaw, -0.5)**: Self-defined "±2 seconds" tolerance explicitly stated, but Payment Processed merged despite **5-second diff** (10:02:00Z vs. 10:02:05Z), acknowledged as "slightly outside" yet overridden by "contextual" notes. Prompt specifies "<2 seconds" (e.g.), and requires confidence for matching; this bends rules arbitrarily. Semantic similarity ("payment handling") is plausible but not "confidently" within timing criteria—should have left separate or flagged more strongly. Creates inconsistency in applied logic.
  - **Borderline Tolerance Inexactitude (Minor, -0.2)**: Order Received (exactly 2s diff) and Item Shipped (exactly 2s) matched under "within tolerance," but prompt says "**less than** 2 seconds." "±2s" redefinition ignores "<"; exactly 2s is not strictly "<2s." Practical, but hypercritically imprecise.
  - **Event Naming Uniformity (Minor Unclarity, -0.1)**: Unified names lean to Log A (good), but phrasing like "Event Type (Unified)" implies stricter standardization; "Payment Processed" vs. B's "PaymentCheck" is justified semantically but could note alternative name in table for fuller integration.
  - **No Dual Timestamps (Minor Omission, -0.1)**: Prompt allows "include both" timestamps for differs; always picks A without noting B's (except in reasoning). Not required, but misses optional enrichment for transparency.

- **Overall**: Nearly flawless execution—comprehensive, accurate, and directly responsive. Deductions only for tolerance inconsistencies (core to matching logic) prevent 10.0. 9.2 reflects excellence with pinpoint flaws.
