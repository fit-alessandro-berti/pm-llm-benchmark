The provided SQL query is flawless. It correctly uses CTEs to compute ordered activity sequences per `case_id` via `STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp)` (valid DuckDB syntax with optional empty delimiter, uniquely identifying variants for grouping), aggregates counts per variant, selects the top K via `ORDER BY case_count DESC LIMIT K` (standard placeholder for parameterized K in benchmarks), and INNER JOINs back to `event_log` to return exactly the required events from top-K-variant cases, excluding others. No syntax errors beyond expected parameterization, no logical flaws, efficient (single `case_variants` computation), handles all requirements precisely.
