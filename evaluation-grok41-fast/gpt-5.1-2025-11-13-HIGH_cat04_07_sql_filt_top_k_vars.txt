**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This SQL query is **excellent overall**—logically sound, efficient, correctly implements all requirements, and produces the exact desired output. It flawlessly:
- Extracts ordered sequences per `case_id` using `string_agg(activity, '->' ORDER BY "timestamp")` (correct DuckDB syntax; preserves order and handles variable-length sequences uniquely).
- Groups/aggregates by sequence for variant identification and counts cases per variant.
- Identifies top K via `ORDER BY case_count DESC LIMIT` (stable for ranking by frequency).
- Filters to exact matching cases via JOIN on `variant_sequence`.
- Returns **all events** (`e.*`) from **only** those cases, with sensible ordering (`ORDER BY case_id, "timestamp"` for readability, though not strictly required).

**Strengths (why not lower):**
- No runtime errors; fully functional in DuckDB.
- Handles edge cases implicitly (e.g., <K variants  takes all; duplicate activities/timestamps  preserved in sequence).
- Efficient CTE chain; no unnecessary computations.
- `USING` clauses clean; quoting of `"timestamp"` safe.

**Issues (strict deductions, totaling -0.8):**
1. **Hardcoded K=5 (-0.4)**: Prompt specifies generic "top K variants" (variable K expected in benchmark context). Answer hardcodes `LIMIT 5` with manual-replacement comment—incomplete as self-contained query. Ideal: `WITH k AS (SELECT 5::INT AS val) ... LIMIT k.val` or `LIMIT ?` (DuckDB params). Minor but violates "generic K" literalism.
2. **No tie-handling in ranking (-0.2)**: `ORDER BY case_count DESC LIMIT 5` arbitrarily resolves ties (e.g., two variants with count=10; picks nondeterministically without `variant_sequence` tie-breaker or `ROW_NUMBER() <= K`). Prompt implies strict "top K by frequency"; ties create ambiguity (minor logical flaw).
3. **Unnecessary comment verbosity (-0.1)**: "-- replace 5 with your desired K" adds user friction; benchmark expects clean, executable SQL.
4. **Minor style/robustness (-0.1)**: `case_id` unquoted in `ORDER BY` (risky if schema varies); assumes no `->` in `activity` names (edge case for sequence uniqueness, though common practice).

**Nearly flawless** (9+); deductions only for minor parameterization/tie issues. Any execution flaw would drop to <8. Fix K/ties  10.0.
