**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (supporting score above 5.0):**
- Correctly identifies **Group B** as exhibiting bias via the `ScoreAdjustment` (+10 "Community Boost"), tied to `LocalResident=TRUE` and `CommunityGroup != None`, unavailable to Group A (Protected). This accurately captures the systemic favoritism toward Unprotected Group B, leading to systematic differences in decisions (e.g., outcome inversion U003 vs. P002).
- Excellent structure: Executive summary, tables (side-by-side, comparison, pathway diagrams), clear sections on manifestation, laundering, and conclusion. Concise, professional, uses markdown effectively.
- Key insight on **structural exclusion** of Group A from boosts due to protected attributes (`LocalResident=FALSE`, `CommunityGroup=None`). Correctly notes irrelevance/meritlessness of "darts club" boost and process laundering across stages/resources.
- Correctly highlights **outcome inversion** (U003 raw 695 approved post-boost vs. P002 raw 710 rejected) as disparate impact evidence.
- Strong conclusion with policy recommendations.

**Flaws (deducting from 10.0; each minor/major issue significantly impacts per instructions):**
- **Major factual/logical inaccuracy (-1.5):** Claims boost "elevated U003 above the apparent approval threshold (~710)", but table correctly shows U003 final **705** (below 710) yet approved, while P002/U002 at **710 rejected**. This misrepresents numbers (705  ~710 "above"), undermining the explanation. Either overlooked arithmetic or failed to reconcile inconsistency (705 approved < 710 rejected suggests even stronger bias or non-score factors, unaddressed). Hypercritical: sloppy math in core example.
- **Inaccuracy in boost condition (-0.8):** Code block states "`LocalResident = TRUE AND CommunityGroup None`", malformed/incomplete (means `!= None` or present, per U002 counterexample with None/0 adjustment). Table clarifies it, but text/code error confuses; not "flawless."
- **Minor unclarity/oversimplification (-0.3):** Assumes decisions purely score-based (threshold ~710-720), but logs inconsistent (705A vs. 710R even in B); doesn't discuss if Rules Engine weighs boosts differently or other factors. "Damning evidence" overstates without noting intra-B inconsistency.
- **Minor attribution issue (-0.2):** Pins bias "exhibited in Group B's log," correct per question phrasing (B shows adjustments/boosts), but slightly unclear—bias arises in **comparison** (A neutral, B privileged). Could specify "Group B's log exhibits pro-B bias vs. A's neutral process."
- No omissions of key cases (covers P001/U001 parity, U003 inversion, U002/P002 parity).

**Overall:** Near-flawless structure/insights, but core numerical/logical error in flagship example + condition typo prevent >8.0. 7.2 reflects strong but not "nearly flawless" (strict deduction for demonstrable inaccuracies/flaws).
