The provided answer delivers precisely 20 open-ended, thought-provoking questions directly derived from the process description. Each question insightfully probes insights (e.g., Q12 on R&D integration), potential issues (e.g., Q16 on supplier bottlenecks), improvement strategies (e.g., Q13 on customs navigation), and decision implications (e.g., Q3 on carbon vs. speed trade-offs). Coverage spans all key stages (R&D, sourcing, assembly, logistics, distribution, after-sales) and elements (risks, sustainability, tech, finance, compliance). Phrasing is consistently clear, varied, and precise, with no inaccuracies, redundancies, ambiguities, or extraneous content. No SQL or deviations from "just list the questions." Flawless execution.
