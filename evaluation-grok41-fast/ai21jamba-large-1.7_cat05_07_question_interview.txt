**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is strong overall—comprehensive, well-organized by logical categories, fully open-ended, and directly targets the prompt's goals (missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, exceptions). It covers the process end-to-end without requesting SQL or code. However, under utmost strictness, several minor-to-moderate flaws prevent a near-perfect score:

- **Implementation details violations (significant deduction: -1.0)**: The prompt explicitly bans "implementation details." Three questions probe tools/systems/data sources, which cross into specifics:
  | Question | Issue |
  |----------|-------|
  | Decision-Making #2: "Are there specific guidelines **or tools** used to match..." | "Tools" implies implementation (e.g., software). |
  | Marketing #2: "Are there specific **tools or data sources** involved?" | Directly requests implementation (tools/data sources). |
  | Collaboration #2: "**tools or systems (such as CRM or project management software)**..." | Names examples from description; seeks confirmatory implementation details. |
  These undermine "conceptual understanding only."

- **Scope creep (moderate deduction: -0.5)**: "Post-Onboarding Processes" section (2 questions) extends beyond the described "onboarding" lifecycle (ends at audits post-lease). E.g., "post-onboarding phase" and "issues after onboarded" are tangential, not core to clarifying the given process.

- **Minor redundancies/overlaps (minor deduction: -0.2)**: Exceptions handling appears in 3 sections (Decision-Making #3, Process Details #1, Exceptions section), diluting focus. Process Details #3 restates description without deep novelty.

- **Unclarity/minor logical flaws (minor deduction: -0.1)**: 
  - Numbering restarts per section (confusing for a flat list; could use global numbering).
  - Meta framing ("Here is a comprehensive list..." + closing sentence) adds unnecessary verbosity; prompt requests "a list," not explanation.
  - General #3 ("overall timeline") is good but vague on "listed" (property activated vs. tenanted?).

**Strengths (why not lower)**: 28+ targeted questions; excellent category structure enhances usability; uncovers gaps (e.g., rejection criteria, bottlenecks); verifies sequencing/timing well; no criminal/off-topic content.

**Path to 10.0**: Remove tool questions, trim post-onboarding, dedupe exceptions, strip meta text, global numbering = flawless. This is excellent but not "nearly flawless."
