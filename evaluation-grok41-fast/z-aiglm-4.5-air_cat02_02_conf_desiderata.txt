**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This grading is based on utmost strictness, deducting heavily for **any** inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, incompletenesses, or hallucinations. Minor issues alone warrant ~1-2 point deductions per instance; major ones (e.g., missing core violations, fabricating log data) deduct 2+ points each. Perfect structure/content scores 10; each flaw cascades downward. Total deductions from 10: **-6.0**.

#### **Major Deductions (-4.5 total)**:
1. **Missed critical normative violation in Case 2 (-2.0)**: The strict sequence *mandates* "Inform Applicant" after Loan Decision (text: "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; sequence diagram includes it unconditionally). Case 2 log has **no such event** (jumps Decision 09:30  Finalize 10:00). This is a clear "skipping activities" violation (explicitly "What is Not Allowed"). Answer ignores it entirely in Section 1, claiming only two violations. Incomplete identification fails Task 1.
2. **Hallucination of non-existent event (-1.5)**: In Section 2, answer fabricates "Inform Applicant (30 mins post-decision)" for Case 2, which does *not* exist in the log. This is a factual error (10:00 slot is Finalize Documentation), undermining credibility. Logical flaw: Claims Case 2 "fully meets desiderata" (including "prompt" inform per Part 2 text), despite absence proving the opposite (no inform = not prompt).
3. **Misrepresents Case 2 desiderata compliance (-1.0)**: Even ignoring hallucination, no Inform means failure to meet "informed promptly (e.g., within 48 hours)" recommendation (Task 2 requires identifying desiderata failures). Falsely labels as "fully meet[s]."

#### **Moderate/Minor Deductions (-1.5 total)**:
4. **Factual inaccuracy in timings (-0.5)**: Case 2 Credit Check is 60 mins post-Application (08:0009:00), not "20 mins" (confuses with Risk Assessment at 08:20). Minor but hypercritical: Timestamps are explicit; errors erode precision.
5. **Inconsistent handling of Follow-up Call (-0.5)**: Desiderata explicitly encourages it "sometime before closing" for *all* cases (skipping = failure to meet, per Task 2: "Identify which cases fail to meet"). Log implies none have it (only Case 3 notes absence explicitly). Answer notes as "Additional Note" (non-critical) only for Case 3 but claims Cases 1/2 "fully meet desiderata" (false if Follow-up counts). Unclear/inconsistent.
6. **Minor unclarity in justifications (-0.5)**: Section 3 suggestions are reasonable but not "in line with constraints" for Case 2's missing Inform (no justification offered, despite "when possible"). Task 3 requires covering observed behaviors comprehensively.

#### **Strengths (No Credit, But Noted for Balance)**:
- Good structure, table, and summary.
- Correctly IDs Case 2 order reversal + post-rejection Finalize (core normatives).
- Accurate Case 1/3 analysis; solid timing calcs/math for Case 3.
- Covers Tasks 1-3 explicitly.

**Overall**: Competent skeleton ruined by critical factual/logical errors on flagship violating case (Case 2). Not "nearly flawless" (requires 9+); mid-low score reflects partial utility despite failures. Retrain on log fidelity.
