**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (supporting the score):**
- **Relevance and Targeting (excellent):** Questions directly address key prompt goals: decision criteria (e.g., weighting in screening, financial guardrails), roles/responsibilities (e.g., milestone owners, overlapping guidance resolution), timing/sequencing (e.g., deposit "received" trigger, gated vs. retrospective checks), exceptions (e.g., withdrawals, special insurance examples), and missing details (e.g., bias mitigation, source of truth for comms). They uncover conceptual depth like arbitration, escalation paths, hand-offs, and variability.
- **Open-Ended and Conceptual:** All questions are probing ("walk through," "how do you," "what criteria tip") without yes/no traps. Strictly high-level—no SQL, no tech implementation (e.g., tech Q explicitly avoids brands; focuses on integration mismatches conceptually).
- **Organization and Coverage Depth:** Thematic headings (e.g., "Exception and edge-case handling") provide structure, grouping logically by process phase. Adds value on implied gaps (e.g., fair housing from description's audits, market variability from multi-city mention). Closing summary ties back to prompt goals effectively.
- **No Policy Violations:** Adult/offensive content N/A; no criminal aid.

**Flaws (deducting points strictly; each minor= -0.5 to -1.0 range impact, major= -1.5+):**
- **Incomplete Process Coverage (-1.8):** Skewed heavily to mid/late stages (screening onward: lease, audits, tenants) and extras (scalability, KPIs, feedback—not explicitly in description). Ignores early stages' missing details: doc review criteria (e.g., what makes docs "outdated"? escalation for missing?), manager assignment specifics (description lists factors but no probe on scoring/workload thresholds), intro call sequencing, photo/inspector scheduling/timing, repair workflows, marketing creation/pricing models. Claims "entire lifecycle" in summary but delivers ~60% coverage—logical gap for "complex property onboarding process" as described start-to-finish.
- **Formatting/Sloppy Presentation (-0.9):** Starts with unnumbered bullets (implied tenant screening, perhaps 8-9?), jumps to "10." without 1-9—looks like truncated/incomplete paste, confusing reader on full list. Minor visual clutter (leading comma/spaces in " ,   • "). Not "a list" in clean, sequential form; undermines professionalism.
- **Scope Creep/Extrapolation (-0.8):** ~30% questions venture beyond described process into hypotheticals/speculation (e.g., "future scalability," "early warning signs," "continuous improvement governance," "new regions contingency plans"). Prompt specifies "their process" (current, as explained) for "conceptual understanding"—these are forward-looking, not clarifying described flow. Minor overreach but logically dilutes focus.
- **Minor Unclarities/Over-Specificity (-0.3):** Some assume unmentioned details (e.g., "margin threshold, market percentile"—probes well but presupposes analyst uses them). No outright inaccuracies, but phrasing like "who arbitrates if landlord and manager disagree?" injects unmentioned conflict (minor logical stretch).
- **Redundancy (-0.0):** None severe; pairs per section are complementary.

**Overall:** High-quality, insightful questions (8.5+ raw), but incompleteness and sloppiness prevent "nearly flawless" (9.5-10). Strict deduction yields 7.2—strong B but not A-level for comprehensive, polished response to full process.
