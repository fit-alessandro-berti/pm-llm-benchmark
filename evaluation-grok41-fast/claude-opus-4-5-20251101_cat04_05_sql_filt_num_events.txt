### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)

**Strengths (Supporting High Base Score):**
- **Main Solution (Subquery with IN)**: Flawless. Correctly identifies qualifying `case_id`s via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`, then returns `e.*` for full events. Handles the exact requirement: filters cases >6 events, returns full rows for 6. Standard SQL, DuckDB-compatible. No logical flaws, efficient.
- **Explanation**: Crystal-clear, accurate two-part breakdown. No unclarities.
- **JOIN Alternative**: Perfect. Equivalent to main, returns `e.*`, well-optimized.
- **Structure/Readability**: Professional markdown, table for performance adds value without bloat.
- **Performance Table**: Mostly accurate; notes DuckDB optimizer strengths realistically. Minor pros/cons balanced.

**Fatal Flaws/Deductions (Strict Penalty Application):**
- **Window Function Alternative (Major Inaccuracy, -1.5)**: Logically sound for filtering/counting, but **fails to return the full set of events**. Final `SELECT` explicitly lists only `case_id, activity, timestamp`, omitting any additional columns (prompt specifies "at least" these, implying potential extras like resources, attributes). Task demands "full set of events" (all columns per row). Uses `*` in CTE but drops columns in output—inconsistent and incorrect. This renders the alternative broken for real-world use, undermining credibility.
- **Performance Claims (Minor Inaccuracy/Unclarity, -0.3)**: "Subquery (IN): May be slower on very large datasets"—misleading; this is a non-correlated independent subquery, optimized identically to JOIN by DuckDB (often materialized). "Window function... single pass... often performs best"—debatable/overstated; windows require partitioning (hash/sort), not always superior. Table implies unnecessary trade-offs.
- **Over-Provision of Alternatives (Minor Bloat, -0.2)**: Task asks for *a* query; extras are nice but introduce risk (flawed window). Strict reading: unnecessary, risks distraction/flaws.

**Overall**: Excellent main solution elevates to ~9+, but inaccuracies in prominent alternative (not "nearly flawless"—a broken code block is significant) and nitpicks warrant strict cuts. No criminal/edge-case issues, but not 10.0 perfection. Equivalent to A- work.
