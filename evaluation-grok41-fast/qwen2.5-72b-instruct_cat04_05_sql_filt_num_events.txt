**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Correctness and Logic (9.5/10)**: The query perfectly identifies cases with 6 events via accurate GROUP BY and COUNT(*), filters correctly (WHERE event_count <= 6 matches "six or fewer" / "more than six" exclusion), and retrieves all events for valid cases via JOIN. No logical flaws, duplicates, or misses (e.g., handles edge cases like 0-6 events flawlessly). DuckDB-compatible (CTEs, standard SQL). Equivalent to optimal subquery/IN or window function alternatives.
- **Completeness (8.5/10)**: Returns events from valid cases only—core task nailed. However, **minor but notable inaccuracy**: SELECTs only `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp` explicitly, not `SELECT e.*` or all columns. Prompt specifies "at least" these columns and demands "the **full set of events**" (implying complete rows/data). If additional columns exist (likely, as "at least"), this omits them, failing "full set." Explanation claims "full set" despite this—unclarity/inconsistency deducts.
- **Efficiency/Clarity (10/10)**: Clean CTE chaining (readable, optimizable in DuckDB). JOIN efficient (no self-scan issues).
- **Extras (9.0/10)**: ORDER BY `case_id`, `timestamp` is helpful/logical (sequences events) but unrequested—neutral, not flawed. Explanation precise, structured, numbered—excellent.
- **Strictness Adjustments**: No syntax errors, no over/under-filtering, no assumptions (e.g., timestamps sortable). Column selection is the sole (minor) gap, but "hypercritical" mandates deduction (~0.8 total) as it risks incomplete output in real scenarios. Nearly flawless; 10 requires `SELECT e.*` + no extras.
