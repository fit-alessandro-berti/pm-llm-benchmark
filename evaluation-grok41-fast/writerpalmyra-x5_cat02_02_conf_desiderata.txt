**7.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Assessment)
This answer is strong in structure, clarity, and overall coverage—excellent use of sections, bullet points, sequences, table, and justifications make it highly readable and comprehensive. It correctly identifies most normative violations (Case 2's ordering and post-rejection documentation), accurately assesses Case 1 and 3 as normatively compliant, and handles desiderata timings/delays well (e.g., precise hour calculations for Case 3). Justifications are thoughtful and contextual, aligning with the task. The summary table is effective.

**Major Flaws (Significantly Deducting Score - Logical/Accuracy Errors):**
- **Critical Misclassification of "Inform Applicant" in Case 2**: This is a **strict normative violation** (required after *every* Loan Decision, per sequence: "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"). Case 2 completely skips it (no activity in log after Rejection  Finalize  Close). The answer wrongly relegates it to *desiderata* ("Violation of desideratum... even if not a strict rule"), explicitly claiming "it wasn't listed as normative—only recommended." This is factually inaccurate—the textual description and sequence diagram mandate it unconditionally (before branching for approve/reject). Not listing it as a 3rd normative deviation for Case 2 makes the analysis incomplete for Task 1. Deduction: -2.0 (core task failure on violation identification/explanation).
- **Incomplete Normative Violations List**: Case 2 has *three* strict issues (Risk before Credit; Finalize after Reject; Skip Inform), but only two noted. Table compounds by not flagging missing Inform under "Key Issues" distinctly as normative.

**Minor Flaws (Further Deductions - Inconsistencies/Unclarities):**
- **Inconsistent Handling of Follow-up Call (Desiderata)**: Log shows *no* cases have it, yet it's "encouraged... before closing" (a desideratum failure for all). Case 1 correctly marked "No" desiderata issues (timings perfect), but Cases 2/3 flagged for absence—logical inconsistency. Task 2 requires identifying *all* desiderata failures; Case 1 should note it (even softly). Deduction: -0.5.
- **Overreach/Extraneous Content**: Ends with unasked offer ("help designing process alerts?")—minor distraction, ignores "when possible" for justifications. Deduction: -0.2.
- **Unclarity in Case 2 Desiderata**: Lists "Credit Check... Meets" (true), but then pivots to missing Inform (misplaced) and follow-up; feels padded since no promptness issue exists without Inform.

**Strengths (Supporting Score):**
- Perfect on Case 1/3 normative compliance and Case 3 delays.
- Timings calculated precisely (e.g., ~51 hours for Case 3 Inform).
- Justifications balanced ("doesn't excuse," real-world notes).
- No other inaccuracies; hyper-detailed sequences/visuals aid clarity.

**Overall**: Excellent effort (9/10 structure/content), but the Inform misclassification is a pivotal logical flaw (directly contradicts source text, undermines Task 1/2), warranting strict penalty. Not "nearly flawless" (requires 9.5+). Baseline 10  -3.0 = 7.0.
