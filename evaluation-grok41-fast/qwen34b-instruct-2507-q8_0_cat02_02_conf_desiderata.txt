**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Assessment)
This grade reflects a structured, comprehensive response with strong organization (tables, summaries, interpretations), correctly identifying *some* normative violations (Case 2's Risk before Credit and Finalize after reject) and most desiderata issues. However, **critical inaccuracies, omissions, and logical flaws** prevent a higher score under strict criteria:

#### Major Inaccuracies/Omissions (Each Warranting -1.5 to -2.0):
1. **Missed Normative Violation in Case 2 (Critical)**: The strict sequence mandates "**Loan Decision  Inform Applicant**" ("the applicant **must** be informed of the outcome"; "Inform Applicant **must occur after** Loan Decision"; no skipping steps). Case 2's log explicitly skips "Inform Applicant" entirely (Decision  Finalize  Close). This is a clear "skipping activities" violation, equivalent in severity to the identified ones. Not flagging it renders Part 1 incomplete and explanations insufficient. Logical flaw: Answer lists the sequence without Inform but ignores it as a violation.
   
2. **Factual Error on Case 3 Timing**: Claims Credit Check is "**5 days later**" (Jan-12 09:00 to Jan-14 10:00 = ~49 hours / 2 days). This miscalculation undermines credibility, even if >24h still holds for desiderata. Minor but factual inaccuracy per hypercritical standards.

#### Logical Flaws/Unclarities (Each -0.5 to -1.0):
3. **Case 2 Desiderata Confusion**: Garbled text—"Credit Check ... 10 minutes after risk assessment **not within 24h**"—is illogical (10 min *is* within 24h; relevant metric is ~1h from application, correctly noted later). Claims "no timing on informing applicant = no violation," ignoring total absence fails "informed promptly within 48h of decision" (non-performance  promptness).
   
4. **Incomplete Desiderata for Case 2**: Treats missing Inform/Follow-up as merely "not recorded/suboptimal" without noting absence precludes meeting timing desiderata. Secondary to normative break but unclarified.

5. **Minor Structural/Precision Issues**: 
   - No justification/interpretation for missing Inform in Case 2 (Part 3 opportunity missed).
   - Desiderata analysis for Case 2 deemed "cannot be evaluated meaningfully" then partially done—inconsistent.
   - Final Boxed Answer omits missed violation, perpetuating incompleteness.
   - Over-emphasizes "serious breach" phrasing (not required by task) while under-explaining skips.

#### Strengths (Supporting >1.0):
- Excellent structure/readability (tables, summaries).
- Correctly flags all *explicit log-highlighted* violations.
- Proper distinction: Normative strict vs. desiderata suboptimal.
- Good interpretations/suggestions aligned with task.
- Covers Follow-up Call across cases.

**Overall**: ~60-70% accurate/effective (good skeleton, flawed execution). Not "nearly flawless"—multiple flaws compound to halve potential score. A 10.0 requires zero misses; 8+ allows only trivial clarities. This is competent but not exemplary.
