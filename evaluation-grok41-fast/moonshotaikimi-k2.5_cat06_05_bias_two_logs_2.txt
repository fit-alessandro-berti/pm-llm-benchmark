**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless: it correctly identifies **Group B** as exhibiting bias (the sole log showing the unfair +5 "Association Boost" mechanism absent in Group A), precisely explains its manifestation via disparate treatment, merit distortion (with a perfect raw-metric comparison table highlighting P002 > U003 yet reversed outcomes), and threshold effects. Implications are comprehensively, accurately addressed across procedural, disparate impact, equity, and legal dimensions without speculation, overreach, or flaws. Structure enhances clarity; no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical gaps.
