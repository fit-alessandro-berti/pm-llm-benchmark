**9.8**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This grading is based solely on the final answer (ignoring `<think>`), assessed with utmost strictness for accuracy to the process description, logical coherence, clarity, completeness, and fidelity to the question. The answer is exceptionally strong—structured, precise, evidence-based, and directly responsive—but deducts 0.2 for two minor issues: (1) slight over-extrapolation in Step 3 bias description ("correlate *strongly* with socioeconomic status, family history, and access to networks" – process only says "often correlates" with club membership and implies via residency, making "strongly" and added factors a tiny unsubstantiated stretch); (2) implications include "perpetuate existing socioeconomic divides *within the community*" – process focuses on local vs. non-local, not explicitly intra-community divides, introducing minor unclarity. No other inaccuracies, logical flaws, ambiguities, or omissions; justifications are balanced then rigorously dismantled with direct process quotes; implications fully cover fairness/equity; conclusion is incisive without prescribing beyond discussion. Nearly flawless under hypercritical lens.
