**7.0**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting score above 5.0)**: Correctly identifies the exact non-compliant cases (2, 3, 5) and compliant ones (1, 4). Excellent overall structure with clear summaries, tables, rule extraction, and final answer format matching the task. References normative description effectively (e.g., sequencing dependencies, no ship after cancel). Good interpretation of mandatory sequences and branches.
- **Major flaws deducting points (strict deductions)**:
  - **Factual inaccuracy in Case 2 (significant, -1.5)**: Repeatedly misstates the sequence. Claims ""Ship order" occurs before authorization" (bullet point), "packaging and shipping before payment authorization" (table and multiple explanations), and "skips authorizing payment before... shipping" (conclusion/final answer). **False**: Timestamps show Authorize payment (10:30) *before* Ship (11:00). Only Package (10:00) is before Authorize. This is a clear misreading of the log, compounding into multiple incorrect statements.
  - **Incomplete violations in Case 3 (-1.0)**: Flags Ship after Cancel (correct), but misses: (1) Authorize Payment before Cancel violates "directly proceed to Cancel" after Check for insufficient inventory; (2) no Package Items before Ship (universal rule: Ship only after Package). Focuses narrowly, ignoring description's "directly" and sequence mandates.
  - **Minor unclarities/logical slips (-0.5)**: Case 2 explanation says "Ship order" before authorization (already deducted) and vaguely "another violation" without fixing. Case 5 phrasing "Ship order appears before packaging" is odd (packaging absent, not "before"). Rule summary adds "Close order before all required steps" (not violated anywhere, unnecessary).
- **Why not lower (e.g., 5.0)**: Core task (ID cases + explain) mostly accurate; errors don't flip case assessments.
- **Why not higher (e.g., 9.0)**: Not "nearly flawless"—factual/logical errors are prominent, repeated, and central to explanations. Strict policy demands heavy deduction for "any inaccuracies."
