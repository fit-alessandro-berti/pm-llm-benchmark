**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: Correctly identifies Group B as the biased log (+1.5). Accurately notes absence of adjustments in Group A vs. presence in Group B (+1.2). Describes manifestation as preferential treatment via +5 boost (+1.0). Implications discussed at a basic level (unequal treatment, perception, legal/ethical issues; +1.0). Clear structure and conclusion (+0.8). No major factual errors.
- **Inaccuracies/Unclarities (major deductions)**: Fails to engage specifically with data—e.g., no mention of how boost directly swayed outcomes (U001: base 6065 hired, mirroring P002/U002's 60 not hired; U003: 75/65/5863 hired despite lower scores than P001/P003's 65 cultural fit). Generalizes "can influence" without evidence (-1.2). Ignores LocalResident (FALSE in A, TRUE in B) and its tie to "LocalBusinessLeadersClub," missing systemic inter-group disparity (protected non-locals denied equivalent opportunity; -1.0). Labels "Protected/Unprotected" without explaining relevance to bias (e.g., potential disparate impact on protected class; -0.6).
- **Logical Flaws (major deductions)**: Assumes Group A "solely" merit-based without noting cultural fit itself could be subjective (minor, but strict: -0.3). Implications superficial/generic (no link to disparate hiring rates: A 2/3 hired, B 2/3 but boost-dependent; -0.5). Adds unasked recommendations (dilutes focus, implies incomplete grasp of question scope; -0.8).
- **Other (minor but penalized strictly)**: Wordy/fluffy (e.g., "perception of bias can lead to dissatisfaction"); no quantitative comparison (-0.4). Overall high-level, not analytical depth expected for "discuss how this bias manifests."

Nearly flawless would require data-specific examples, cross-group score/hiring comparisons, LocalResident analysis, and no extras—award reserved for 9.5+. This is solid but flawed mid-tier response.
