**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: Structure perfectly matches the 3 tasks. Duration calculations are mostly accurate (minor arithmetic error in Case 105: actually ~49h5m, not 50h5m; negligible). Root cause analysis correctly identifies escalations, post-escalation waits (e.g., 2.5h in 102, 28h+ in 105), and overnight gaps (~19h across cases) as key factors, with clear explanations of how they inflate cycle times (e.g., unavailability, prioritization). Recommendations are practical, specific (SLAs, alerting, workload analysis), and directly tied to factors. Common patterns and conclusion synthesize well.
- **Major Flaws (significant deductions)**:
  - **Task 1 inaccuracy**: Fails to identify **Case 104** (24h10m) as significantly long—nearly identical to Case 102 (25h10m), far exceeding short cases (101/103: ~1-2h). Explicitly flags only 102/105 as "significantly longer," treating 104 as normal. This is a logical flaw; average "around 13h55m excluding 102/105" is wrong (~9.25h actual for 101/103/104) and misleadingly normalizes 104.
  - **Task 2 incompleteness**: Root cause section analyzes *only* 102/105, ignoring 104's delays (3.5h post-assignment to L1 investigate; 19h investigate-to-resolve). Misses non-escalation pattern (L1 bottlenecks/overnight in 104), making causes partially attributed to escalations only—104 proves otherwise.
  - **Task 3 logical gap**: Explanations/recs overweight escalations/L2 (valid but incomplete); underemphasizes general L1 waits/overnight across *all* long cases (102/104/105). No mention of 104 in recs implicitly assumes escalation-only issue.
- **Minor Flaws (further deductions)**: Slight unclarities (e.g., "average ~13h55m" unexplained/wrong); no full avg calc including all cases for context; ignores triage/assignment consistency across cases as non-issue without evidence.
- **Overall**: Strong but not "nearly flawless"—core identification/logic flawed by omitting Case 104 (critical miss for pattern detection), preventing 9+. Deducted ~2.8 points total for incompleteness/inaccuracies.
