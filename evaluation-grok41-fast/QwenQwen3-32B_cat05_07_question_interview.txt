The provided answer is a nearly flawless execution of the prompt. It delivers a comprehensive, structured list of 20 targeted, open-ended questions that precisely address the required areas: missing details (e.g., specific certificates, common issues), decision criteria (e.g., conflicting priorities, tenant prioritization), roles/responsibilities (e.g., coordinator validation, inspector selection), timing/sequencing (e.g., phase durations, milestones), and exceptions (e.g., missing docs, special insurance, custom clauses). All questions derive directly from the process description without introducing unrelated elements, avoid any technical/SQL/implementation specifics (focusing purely on conceptual workflows, strategies, and adaptations), and maintain strict open-ended phrasing ("What," "How," "Can you share"). Categorization enhances clarity without redundancy, and framing sentences reinforce the goal. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or even minor deviations—perfect alignment and depth.
