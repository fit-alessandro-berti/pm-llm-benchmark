The answer is exemplary: precise semantics (correctly interprets LOOP([A,I]) as always ending in A, with valid traces like A, AIA, AI AIA, etc.; accurate macro-flow and illustrations); exhaustively identifies all key anomalies (optional silent credit skip; zero/multiple invoices; always A before P; unbounded re-approval post-invoice; no exceptions); hyper-detailed, business-grounded explanations (financial/compliance/audit risks; conformance pitfalls); no inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws—structure, logic, and impacts are flawless and directly tied to the model code.
