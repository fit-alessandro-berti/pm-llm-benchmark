**10.0**

The final event log is exemplary and fully compliant with all requirements. It correctly uses `order_id` as Case ID, derives precise activities (e.g., separate "Item Picked" per line for granularity with distinct timestamps/resources, split deliveries/invoices/payments handled individually), maps timestamps accurately with strict per-case chronological sorting, enriches with looked-up Resource names (appropriately using "System" for payments), and includes relevant Other Attributes (e.g., item details, amounts, notes). All events across all orders (including incomplete 1004) are included without omission or duplication. Assumptions are clearly documented. The Markdown table is clean, comprehensive, and ready for process mining. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws detected.
