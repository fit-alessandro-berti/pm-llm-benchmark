**8.0**

The answer is well-structured, directly addresses all three tasks with clear sections, accurate identification of Case 1 as compliant, Case 2 as normatively violating (correctly pinpointing the out-of-order Risk Assessment before Credit Check and inappropriate Finalize Documentation after rejection), and Case 3 as normatively compliant but suboptimal on desiderata. Desiderata analysis correctly distinguishes non-severe issues (e.g., delays and missing Follow-up Call), with appropriate clarification of suboptimality. Interpretations and justifications are plausible and aligned with constraints. The final summary table concisely captures conclusions without fluff.

Minor deductions for: (1) not explicitly flagging the missing "Inform Applicant" in Case 2 as a normative skip (a required step post-Decision, per sequence/rules, before Close on rejected path—present in final table omission); (2) a factual miscalculation in Case 3 Credit Check timing ("**4 days**" instead of ~2 days in observations, though final conclusion/table accurately states ">24h" without error). These are inaccuracies in supporting details/final listings, but do not undermine core conclusions (Case 2 properly flagged as violating, Case 3 delays correctly noted as desiderata fails). Nearly flawless under strict scrutiny, but not entirely due to these gaps.
