**6.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
**Strengths (why not lower):**
- Excellent structure: Clear sections matching the task (1,2,3), uses tables for clarity, summary table ties it together. Readable and professional.
- Correctly identifies Case 2's two explicit violations (Risk before Credit; Finalize after reject) with solid explanations.
- Accurately deems Cases 1/3 normatively compliant.
- Task 3 interpretations are thoughtful, balanced (e.g., "weak" vs. "reasonable"), and on-topic.
- Distinguishes desiderata as "suboptimal/not serious" correctly.
- Minor details like Case 1 being "exemplary" align well.

**Fatal Flaws (major deductions - these alone cap at ~6.0):**
1. **Missed critical normative violation in Case 2**: No identification of the *complete skip of "Inform Applicant"*, which is **mandatory** post-Decision for *all* cases ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; sequence explicitly includes it before branching/closing). Case 2 log: Decision (09:30)  Finalize (10:00)  Close (10:30), skipping Inform entirely. This is a *third serious sequencing/skip violation* (not allowed: "Skipping activities in the required sequence"). Claiming "Two Serious Violations" is incomplete/factually wrong—hypercritical lens sees this as a glaring oversight undermining Task 1.
2. **Factual error in timings (Case 3 desiderata)**: Inform Applicant delay miscalculated as "~75 hours later [+27 hours]" vs. actual ~51 hours (Jan-14 12:00 to Jan-16 15:00 = 48h to Jan-16 12:00 + 3h). Sloppy math; table propagates error. Even if approximate, it's inaccurate and unprofessional for a strict analysis.
3. **Logical flaw in Case 2 desiderata**: Claims "timing desiderata were actually met (Credit Check and notification occurred promptly)". But *no notification exists* (missing Inform), so "notification promptly" is impossible/false. Credit timing (~1h20m) is fine, but bundling with nonexistent notification is misleading.

**Minor-but-Deducted Issues (per "even minor issues significantly lower"):**
- Case 1 desiderata: Marks "Mostly compliant" due to no Follow-up Call, but log shows *none recorded for any case*—inconsistent to ding only Case 3 heavily while soft-pedaling Case 1/2 without uniform logic.
- Interpretations table for Case 2: Suggests "misunderstanding about what 'Finalize Documentation' means (perhaps rejection paperwork?)"—but rules prohibit it post-rejection explicitly ("do not finalize documentation before closing"); this borders on excusing a hard violation.
- Vague phrasing: "Credit Check didn't occur until 09:00 (40 minutes later)"—actual ~1h20m from App (08:00), minor but imprecise.
- No explicit note on Case 2 lacking Inform in Task 3 interpretations (opportunity missed for justification, e.g., "perhaps bundled into Close Case").

**Overall**: Strong format/content but undermined by *incomplete violation detection* (core to Task 1), *factual errors*, and *logical inconsistencies*. Not "nearly flawless"—feels ~70% accurate. A 10.0 requires zero gaps; this has multiple show-stoppers.
