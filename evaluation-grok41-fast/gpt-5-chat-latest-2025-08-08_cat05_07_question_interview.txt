**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (driving high score)**: 
  - Perfect adherence to core requirements: All 32 questions are **targeted, open-ended** (using "How," "What," "Who," etc.), systematically covering **missing details** (e.g., Q6 on data entry timing), **decision criteria** (e.g., Q8 on manager workload tools), **roles/responsibilities** (e.g., Q13 on scheduling), **timing/sequencing** (e.g., Q28 on parallel vs. sequential steps), and **exceptions** (e.g., Q25 on real examples). Logical grouping enhances clarity without redundancy.
  - No SQL queries or overt implementation details; stays **conceptual** (e.g., Q30 on system integration is process-oriented, not technical specs).
  - Comprehensive yet concise; mirrors process flow precisely, uncovering subtleties like escalations (Q26) and mitigations (Q29).
  - In-character framing ("questions I would ask the interviewee") is intuitive and professional.

- **Minor Flaws (deducting 0.8 total, per strictness rule)**:
  - **Extraneous ending offer** (-0.5): "If you want, I can turn these questions into... Do you want me to prepare that?" Violates "produce a list" by adding unprompted next-steps/sales pitch. This breaks purity of response (not "just questions") and simulates ongoing dialogue, ignoring strict output scope. Minor but significant under hypercriticism.
  - **Borderline implementation hints** (-0.2): Q19 ("automatically generated"), Q30 ("how do they integrate"), Q32 ("automated alerts") edge toward system mechanics rather than pure concepts. Conceptual enough (tied to process flow), but strictly, they risk "implementation details" prohibition—flaw even if minor.
  - **Slight leading in one question** (-0.1): Q1 embeds a yes/no ("is it always via...?") amid open-endedness; hypercritically, not 100% pure open-ended.

- **No major issues**: Zero inaccuracies, logical flaws, unclarities, or off-topic content in questions. Exhaustive without bloat (32 is justified for "series" on complex process). Flawless structure, no repetition.

Nearly perfect; deducts only prevent 10.0.
