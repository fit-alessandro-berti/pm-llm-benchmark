**7.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (supporting ~7+ score)**: Structure is excellent (clear sections addressing all 4 tasks). Revised log is fully presented per case with renamed activities correctly applied based on position/context. Justifications are brief, tied to clues (timestamps, prior events, additional context), and mostly accurate. Disambiguates recurrences well (e.g., Initial Check vs. Recheck for Verify; Request Missing Docs vs. Followup for Calls). Extra renames (e.g., Adjust, Submit) enhance clarity without harm. Final log preserves order, resources, contexts (minor rephrasing ok).
- **Major Deductions (strict penalties for inaccuracies/unclarities)**:
  - **Factual error in analysis (Section 1)**: Claims "Verify Documents | 2× per case (except C001 where it appears 3×)" — false. Actual: C001=2, C002=1, C003=2. No case has 3×; not "per case" 2×. This misidentifies recurrences, undermining Task 1.
  - **Contextual mismatches in renames**:
    - "Call Customer – Request Missing Docs" fits C001 perfectly (missing docs explicit), but C002 first call is "clarify account discrepancy" (leads to Adjust Account, not docs) — imprecise.
    - C003 sole "Call Customer – Followup Confirmation" (customer "stepped out... calls to have them return") fits "reminder" better than "confirmation" or "missing docs"; positionally "first"-like but labeled "later"-style, inconsistent with scheme.
  - **Data integrity issues in revised log**: Timestamps reformatted (e.g., "2024-05-01 09:15:00"  "2024050109:15:00") — compacted, ambiguous, deviates from original without reason (harder to parse). Minor context edits (e.g., "Walk-in"  "Walkin", "re-checks"  "rechecks") introduce inconsistencies.
  - **Logical minor flaws**: Adjust Account/Submits renamed despite not recurring *within same case* (Task 2 specifies "recurs"); ok as enhancement but unnecessary. C002 single Verify correctly "Initial Check," but obs error propagates doubt.
- **Overall**: Comprehensive/good (~8 potential), but inaccuracies (factual + contextual), formatting sloppiness, and mismatches prevent "nearly flawless." Strict deduction: 3 points off for errors, 1 for formatting/data fidelity. Not 9+/10 (flawless analysis/log); not <7 (fundamentally broken).
