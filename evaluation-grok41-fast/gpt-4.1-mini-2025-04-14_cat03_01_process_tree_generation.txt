**3.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Summary:
- **Major semantic flaw in loop modeling (primary deduction: -4.0)**: The loop `* ('SC', -> (X('TM', 'SPT'), X('FCE', 'FBA')))` fundamentally misapplies the operator semantics. Per definition, it produces traces always starting and ending with 'SC', with zero or more intervening `-> (X(TM/SPT), X(FCE/FBA))` blocks *before* returning to 'SC' (e.g., 'SC'; 'SC' treat retest 'SC'; etc.). But the process requires traces ending *after* re-diagnostic (e.g., 'SC' -> treat -> retest [exit]; repeats full body). No trace matches a single iteration ending after retest; exits wrongly occur after 'SC'. Correct modeling requires restructuring like `* (body, tau)` or `-> (body, * (tau, body))` where `body = -> ('SC', -> (X('TM', 'SPT'), X('FCE', 'FBA')))` to end after body with silents ignored. This breaks core process logic.
- **Major flaw: Missing conditional entry to loop (-2.0)**: Description explicitly states loop commences "*if* results abnormal" after initial test; if normal, skip directly to advanced imaging/NC. Answer forces mandatory sequence `-> (X('CE', 'FBP'), loop)`, always executing at least 'SC' (even if initial normal). Requires `X (loop, after_loop)` post-initial test. Changes all traces invalidly.
- **Inaccuracy with expected activities (-0.5)**: Lists 'RDT' explicitly, but model omits it entirely (uses `X('FCE', 'FBA')` directly). Description calls RDT "the exclusive choice," but expected set treats as separate activity; unresolved ambiguity ignored.
- **Reasoning unclarities/confusion (-0.5)**: Step-by-step shows hesitation (e.g., mentions tau/placeholders then drops; incorrect "A initially done" misread). Final model ignores own doubts.
- **Minor positives (partial credit)**: Correctly nests binary operators; includes all other activities/structures (initial seq, triage seq, initial X, post-loop +, FAS->DDI, final +); syntactically valid notation; matches non-loop parts precisely.

Overall: Ambitious but critically flawed on central loop/conditional (50%+ of complexity); not "nearly flawless." Equivalent to half-credit for structure/effort despite failures.
