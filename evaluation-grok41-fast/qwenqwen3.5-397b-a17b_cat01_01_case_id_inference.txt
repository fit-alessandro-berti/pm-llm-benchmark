The final answer is flawless: it correctly identifies exactly three cases using the unique `patient_age` + `patient_gender` combinations as the primary invariant keys (45/M, 62/F, 28/M), with all 18 events perfectly partitioned without overlap or omission (5+7+6=18). Timestamps are strictly increasing within each case. Activity/department flows are logically validated against standard hospital protocols (ER trauma with imaging; ER infection with labs/prescription; elective surgery end-to-end). Tables are precise, comprehensive, and self-contained, with tailored logic summaries tying additional_info to flows. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws.
