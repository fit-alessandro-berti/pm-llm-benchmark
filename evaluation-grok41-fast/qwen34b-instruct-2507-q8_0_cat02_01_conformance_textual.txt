**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (near-flawless aspects)**:
  - **Correct identification of violating cases**: Precisely flags Cases 2, 3, and 5; correctly clears 1 and 4. No misses or false positives.
  - **Structure and clarity**: Exemplary—summarized rules accurately, per-case tables, step-by-step analysis, summary table, concise final answer matching task exactly. References description directly with quotes. Interprets ambiguities well (e.g., Package as mandatory).
  - **Core explanations accurate**:
    - Case 2: Spot-on (Package before Authorize violates explicit constraint).
    - Case 5: Correctly infers Package mandatory ("should be prepared... only after"), flags skip as violation.
    - Case 3: Correctly flags Ship after Cancel (explicit "never after cancellation"; "illogical to continue fulfillment").
  - **Logical flow**: Infers paths correctly (sufficient vs. cancel), resolves ambiguities strictly per text (e.g., no skipping Package).

- **Minor inaccuracies/unclarities/logical flaws (deductions)**:
  - **Case 3 incompleteness (significant for strictness)**: Flags only Ship after Cancel, but misses **multiple layered violations**:
    - No Package at all, yet Ship occurs (violates "Ship order should only occur after packaging").
    - Authorize Payment before Cancel (violates branch logic: insufficient  "directly proceed to Cancel" after Check; Authorize is sufficient-path only, "only makes sense once sufficiency known"). Sequence mismatches both paths.
    - Explanation quotes rule but ignores "after packaging" part, under-explaining. Hypercritical: This is a logical gap—partial explanation hides full deviation severity.
  - **Wording nit in Case 5**: "Shipping occurs **before packaging**" implies Package happened later (it didn't); better: "without prior/implying Package." Minor but unclear phrasing (-0.1).
  - **Over-summarization in keys**: Rule #2 ok, but #7/#8 use "must" (stronger than text's "should/only appropriate"); accurate interpretation but not verbatim (-0.1).
  - **Superficiality**: No note on timestamps implying real-time deviations (e.g., Case 2 packages ~30min after Check, before Auth). Not required, but enriches; strictness sees as missed depth (-0.1).
  - **Redundancy**: "Final Output" repeats summary unnecessarily; "End of Response" extraneous.

- **Scoring**: Starts at 10.0, deduct 0.5 for Case 3 incompleteness (core explanation flaw), 0.3 total for minors. Still very high—flawless on ID/task compliance, only hyper-picky gaps prevent 10.0.
