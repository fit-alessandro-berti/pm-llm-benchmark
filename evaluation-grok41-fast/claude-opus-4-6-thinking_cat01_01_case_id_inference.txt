The provided answer is flawless in accuracy, completeness, clarity, and logical rigor. It correctly identifies and groups all 18 events into exactly three distinct cases using the optimal discriminators (patient_age + patient_gender as unique pseudo-IDs, confirmed by perfect matching across all attributes, timestamps, departments, resources, and activity sequences). No events are omitted, duplicated, or misassigned. Each case follows a coherent, timestamp-ordered clinical pathway with seamless narrative alignment to additional_info (e.g., X-ray  fracture diagnosis; lab  infection  antibiotics; surgery prep  procedure  recovery). Structure is exemplary: approach explicitly stated, per-case tables precise, narratives concise and evidence-based, summary table holistic. Zero inaccuracies, ambiguities, logical flaws, or minor issues—even hypercritically, none exist.
