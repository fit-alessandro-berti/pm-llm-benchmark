**2.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
- **Major logical flaw in loop semantics (fitness failure, -4.0 penalty)**: The proposed `LOOP (A: AE, B: ->(RMI, VF))` follows standard process tree `* (A, B)` semantics: executes AE, then optionally repeats `(VF -> RMI? No: B then A)`. Traces show **exactly one AE** always (e.g., Case 1: AE  RMI  VF  AD; Case 3: AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD). This model forces an extra AE after every B (e.g., AE  RMI  VF  **AE**  ... to exit), which no trace permits. Cannot replay any looping trace without unobserved AE repetitions. Completely breaks fitness for Cases 1/3.
- **Inability to model consecutive RMI (fitness failure, -2.0 penalty)**: B is `-> (RMI, VF)`, allowing only single RMI per iteration followed immediately by VF. Case 3 has **RMI  RMI** (two consecutive RMI before VF). Model cannot produce `RMI  RMI  VF`; best it can do post-AE is RMI  VF (one iteration) or RMI  VF  AE  ... (invalid). Ignores observed multi-RMI behavior.
- **Mismatch between tree and notes (clarity/inconsistency, -1.0 penalty)**: Notes claim "zero or more iterations of **RMI followed by VF**" implying RMI+  VF (e.g., RMI  RMI  VF), but tree implements `(AE  (RMI  VF  AE)*)`. Notes describe correct intent (~AE  (RMI*  VF)?) but tree fails to deliver it. Misleading and self-contradictory.
- **Missed structure for optional loop (precision/simplicity failure, -0.5 penalty)**: No XOR/choice after AE to select "direct AD" (Case 2) vs. "RMI handling  AD". Loop forces AE always first/last in block, bloating model unnecessarily. Simpler correct structure possible: e.g., `-> (RA, VF, AE, XOR(AD, ->(RMI, * (RMI, tau), VF)), SC, AC)` (or similar for RMI+  VF), but this is wrong.
- **Minor positives (partial credit, +1.0 base)**: Captures main sequence (RA  VF  ...  AC), identifies loop intent around RMI/VF, always-first RA/VF/AE, final AD/SC/AC. Textual format readable, no execution errors.
- **Overall**: Fundamentally unfit (cannot replay log traces), imprecise, illogical. Not "nearly flawless"—core model broken. Strict policy demands low score for such inaccuracies.
