The provided final query is correct, precise, and fully satisfies the requirements. It accurately identifies `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via the subquery and returns all events (`SELECT *`) from those cases using `IN`, preserving the full event details without any filtering errors, inefficiencies, or extraneous clauses. It works correctly in DuckDB, handles the grouping/filtering logic flawlessly, and matches the problem statement exactly (excludes >6 events, includes <=6). No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws.
