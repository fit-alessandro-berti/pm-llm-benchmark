**9.2**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Statements/Conclusions Only):
- **Task 1 (Identify long cases)**: Early clear identification of 2002, 2003, 2005 as "significantly longer" vs. 2001/2004 short; upheld implicitly in conclusion without contradiction. Flawless.
- **Task 2 (Analyze attributes)**: Final analysis pins root causes precisely on complexity correlating with multiple doc requests (perfect match to data: lows=0 requests/short; medium=1/longer; highs=2-3/longest). Correctly downplays single resources/regions as primary (data supports mixed results). No inaccuracies in conclusive correlations.
- **Task 3 (Explanations & mitigations)**: Conclusion explains causality ("complexity ... resulting need for multiple requests"); suggestions (doc streamlining, training, allocation, prioritization, reviews) directly target causes, logical, actionable. No fluff or irrelevance.
- **Overall**: Conclusions are concise, accurate, evidence-based, comprehensive—no logical flaws, unclarities, or omissions. Near-perfect (deduct 0.8 for lack of explicit case list/reiteration in absolute final para, minor hypercriticism on structure despite content excellence). Earlier errors (e.g., duration miscalc, resource mixup) ignored per instructions.
