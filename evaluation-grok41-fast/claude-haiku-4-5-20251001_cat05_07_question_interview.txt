### Evaluation Summary
This is an exceptionally strong response: comprehensive, logically structured, highly relevant, and directly aligned with the prompt's goals of uncovering missing details (e.g., Q35), decision criteria (e.g., Q5, Q21), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q22, Q30), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q14, Q28, Q31), and exception handling (e.g., Q6, Q34). The sectional organization mirrors the process description intelligently, enhancing usability without adding fluff. All 40 questions are targeted, conceptual, and avoid any SQL, implementation, or technical details. The closing note reinforces intent perfectly. Coverage is thorough, including edge cases, communication flows, and lifecycle boundaries, filling gaps in the original description (e.g., re-inspections, appeals, withdrawals).

### Hypercritical Deductions (Minor Issues Only, as No Major Flaws)
- **Open-endedness (primary deduction: -0.4)**: ~20-25% of questions (e.g., Q2, Q4, Q8, Q15, Q17, Q18, Q23, Q32, Q36) start with or include yes/no structures ("Are there...", "Is there...", "Can the..."). While many pivot to open elaboration via "what/how/versus/who," this isn't *purely* open-ended per strict prompt language. Rephrasing all to "What are examples of absolute blockers versus waivable documents?" (etc.) would make it flawless. Not egregious, but a stylistic inaccuracy under utmost strictness.
- **Minor overreach (-0.1)**: Q40 probes "steady-state" slightly beyond core onboarding (ends at move-in/audits per description), though relevant for sequencing clarity. Q26's interest accrual is a tiny tangent (not core process), but still conceptual.
- **No other issues**: Zero inaccuracies, logical flaws, redundancies, unclarities, or off-topic content. No closed questions that halt dialogue; length (40) is ambitious but justified as "a series" for "complex process." Phrasing is professional, interviewee-friendly, and precise.

Nearly flawless—deductions are hyper-pedantic but required per instructions. A 10.0 demands zero quibbles.
