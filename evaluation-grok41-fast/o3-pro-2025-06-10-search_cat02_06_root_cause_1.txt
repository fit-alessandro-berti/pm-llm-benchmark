**9.7**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
**Strengths (justifying high score):**
- **Accuracy of calculations**: All cycle times precisely correct (e.g., Case 105: exactly 49h 5m; gaps like 102's 2.5h and 105's 28h spot-on). Multipliers (13–14x, 27x) logically derived from ~1.75h baseline. No math errors.
- **Correct outlier identification (Task 1)**: Flawlessly flags 102, 104, 105 as "significantly longer" (>24h vs. <3h fast cases). Implicitly baselines 101/103 correctly as non-outliers.
- **Root causes (Task 2)**: Exhaustive, data-driven (escalations in 102/105, non-escalation delay in 104, post-invest gaps in all slow cases, minor triage variance). Distinguishes L1 vs. L2 activities accurately (e.g., 105's pre-escalation L1 "Investigate").
- **Explanation & recommendations (Task 3)**: Causal logic airtight (hand-offs + shift boundaries = fixed delays; quantifies "full day" impact). Recs specific, actionable, tied to data (e.g., SLA for escalation gaps, direct-to-L2). Projected improvement (4–6h) realistic.
- **Clarity & structure**: Bullet-heavy, scannable; uses "gap" terminology consistently. Comprehensive without fluff.
- **Insights**: Nuanced (e.g., 102 wasted L1 assign; universal overnight lag implies policy gating).

**Deductions (minor issues, strictly penalized per instructions):**
- **-0.1**: Baseline "1½–2 hours" slightly imprecise—101 is 2h 15m (exceeds upper bound), yet labeled "normal" without noting variance. Mean of fast cases is ~1h 47m; range claim invites nitpick (though functionally irrelevant vs. 24h+ outliers).
- **-0.1**: Task 3 combines "explain how... leading to increased cycle times **and propose** insights/recommendations," but answer splits into separate 3/4 sections. Improves readability but deviates from exact structure (hypercritical: not "nearly flawless" mirroring).
- **-0.1**: "Delay figures below are rounded"—unnecessary disclaimer (all cited gaps are exact or intuitively precise, e.g., 2.5h=2h 30m, 3.5h=3h 30m); implies imprecision where none exists.
- No major inaccuracies/flaws, but these minors compound to prevent perfect 10.0. Response is otherwise exemplary—award 10.0 only for zero-issue perfection.
