**9.8**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
This grade reflects a near-flawless response: precise, structured, logically sound, and directly addressing all task elements with accurate POWL interpretation. Anomalies are correctly identified with severity implications (e.g., Model 1's concurrency/omissions vs. Model 2's explicit commissions like loop/skip). The decision (Model 1 closer) is well-justified via impact on correctness (mandatory payroll preserved; normative trace valid; ScreenDecide preserved), contrasting error natures effectively. No factual inaccuracies in graph analysis/topological validity (e.g., P-S-I-D-O-Pay-C allowed in Model 1; bypasses/loops in Model 2).

**Minor deductions (-0.2 total):**
- Slight unclarity in Model 1 anomaly #3 ("zombie" activities or "ignored in critical path"): While accurate (Interview can postdate Close in extensions), it underemphasizes that all nodes must execute in POWL/PO, potentially implying optionality (though context clarifies).
- Hyper-minor: "Hire-to-Retire (or Hire-to-Onboard)" glosses prompt's full term without noting no retire activities modeled (irrelevant but imprecise).
- Verbosity in places (e.g., repeated "strict sequence" emphasis), but not obscuring clarity.

No logical flaws, omissions of key edges/operators, or unjustified claims. Exceptionally strong.
