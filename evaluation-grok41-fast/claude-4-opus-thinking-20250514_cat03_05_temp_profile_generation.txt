The response is exemplary and flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It fully adheres to the task by producing a valid Python dictionary with tuple keys (activity pairs) and tuple values (average_time, standard_deviation in seconds). All pairs are logically valid preceding relationships in the implied linear process order (SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS), covering all 9 direct successions plus a comprehensive representative subset (~36 total pairs) spanning 2+ steps for complexity, without including invalid non-preceding pairs.

Averages and standard deviations are realistically estimated for a global supply chain (e.g., long procurement/distribution, short internal manufacturing), with perfect additive consistency across chain distances (e.g., SSRC  SSOP + OPRC; total SSAS sums precisely to ~81.5 days). Standard deviations scale appropriately (larger for longer/more variable spans). No numerical errors, format issues, impossibilities, redundancies, or extraneous content. Comments enhance clarity without detracting. No unclarities, logical flaws, or minor inaccuracies—strictly perfect.
