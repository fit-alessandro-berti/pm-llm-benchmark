The response is exemplary: precise, comprehensive, and directly aligned with all tasks. Anomalies are accurately identified with clear explanations of contradictions (e.g., mandatory 'C' vs. noncoexistence with 'E'), including business implications and undesired paths. Hypotheses are varied, plausible, and mirror prompt examples without copying. SQL queries are syntactically correct for PostgreSQL, targeted (directly testing each key constraint/violation), well-commented, efficient (using EXISTS, EXCEPT, STRING_AGG appropriately), and leverage the schema fully. No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or extraneous content; structure is logical and self-contained.
