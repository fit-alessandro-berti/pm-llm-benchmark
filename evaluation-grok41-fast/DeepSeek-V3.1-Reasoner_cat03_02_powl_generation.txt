**10.0**

The provided code and explanation faithfully and precisely construct a correct POWL model matching the scenario. All dependencies (SR  CS  (DA || ACI)  loop(BNC, D&R)  XOR(CD, MD)  (QA || SA)  GLA) are enforced via proper nesting of StrictPartialOrder (for concurrency and sequencing) and OperatorPOWL (for loop and XOR), with no missing edges, incorrect operators, extraneous silents, or semantic flaws. Concurrency is accurately modeled (no orders within DA/ACI or QA/SA POs, but completion requires both). Labels match exactly. Nesting propagates semantics correctly per POWL definitions. Explanation accurately summarizes without errors. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical issues.
