### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This submission is a high-quality refinement of the original benchmark prompt, significantly improving clarity, structure, and usability for testing LLM SQL generation skills. It preserves the core task's intent (filtering cases by event count >6 and returning full events for qualifying cases) while enhancing presentation. However, minor flaws prevent a perfect 10.0:

#### Strengths (Supporting High Score):
- **Formatting and Readability (Flawless)**: Markdown table for columns adds precision without overwhelming. Numbered requirements break down the task logically, reducing ambiguity. Bolded key terms and structured sections (Scenario, Task, Requirements) make it benchmark-ready and user-friendly.
- **Fidelity to Original Task (Flawless)**: Exactly matches semantics ("more than six"  "> 6", "six or fewer", retain all events/columns for qualifying `case_id`s). Adds "etc." for other columns, aligning with "at least these columns".
- **Benchmark Effectiveness (Near-Flawless)**: Explicitly tests non-trivial SQL (group/count/filter/retrieve rows), requiring CTEs/subqueries/window functions/JOINs/IN—perfect for DuckDB SQL capabilities. "Efficiently" encourages optimized solutions without biasing.
- **Additions Enhance Rigor**: Data types aid realism (DuckDB-specific like `TIMESTAMP`). Descriptions clarify domain (process mining event log). Emphasizes "full set of events" vs. aggregates.
- **Meta-Commentary**: Concise justification ("strong prompt... requires Window Functions or...") demonstrates understanding of why this tests advanced SQL, without spoiling for the benchmark itself.

#### Deductions (Strict/Hypercritical—Minor Issues Significantly Impact):
- **Solution Hinting (-0.4)**: "e.g., using `HAVING`, subqueries, or window functions" spoon-feeds exact techniques. Original avoids this, forcing models to invent them—key for discriminating skill levels. This mildly lowers benchmark difficulty/discrimination (not egregious, but a logical flaw for "utmost strictness").
- **Data Type Ambiguity (-0.3)**: `case_id` as "`VARCHAR` / `INTEGER`" is imprecise/vague (slash implies alternatives without clarity; real event logs standardize). Minor inaccuracy could confuse edge-case queries (e.g., GROUP BY behavior). Other types are spot-on.
- **Presentation Nitpicks (-0.1)**: Leading comma in submission text (",This is a strong...") is a copy-paste artifact/typo, unprofessional. Redundant restatement in requirements 1-3 slightly bloats but doesn't obscure.

**Overall**: Nearly flawless—polished, effective benchmark prompt superior to original. Deductions are minor but per instructions warrant ~0.8 total drop from 10.0. Any major inaccuracy (e.g., wrong task logic) would tank to <5; this doesn't. Ideal for production use with tiny tweaks (remove e.g. list, fix case_id type).
