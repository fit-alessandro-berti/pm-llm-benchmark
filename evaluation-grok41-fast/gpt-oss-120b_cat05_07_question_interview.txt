**10.0**

The provided answer is a meticulously crafted, comprehensive list of 20 targeted, open-ended questions that precisely align with the prompt's objectives. It systematically covers all specified areas—missing details (e.g., exact steps, specific fields), decision criteria (e.g., assignment framework, thresholds), roles/responsibilities (e.g., validation, approvals, auxiliary roles), timing/sequencing (e.g., lead times, turnaround, end-to-end workflow), and exception handling (e.g., incomplete docs, remediation, custom clauses)—without any deviation into SQL, code, or implementation. Questions are logically grouped under descriptive categories for clarity, phrased to elicit conceptual depth (e.g., "decision-making framework," "escalation path," "predefined thresholds"), and free of inaccuracies, redundancies, ambiguities, or logical flaws. The closing summary reinforces intent without excess verbosity. No penalties apply, as it is flawless in execution.
