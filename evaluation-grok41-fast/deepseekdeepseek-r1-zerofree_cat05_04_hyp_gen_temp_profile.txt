**7.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**:
  - Anomalies identification: Nearly flawless. Precisely matches the 4 key anomalous pairs from the example (R-P low STDEV, P-N long/high STDEV, A-C suspiciously fast, E-N too quick). Descriptions accurate (e.g., "25 hours with very low STDEV", "7 days", "2 hours", "5 minutes").
  - Hypotheses: Excellent. 3 per anomaly, directly aligned with prompt suggestions (automation, backlogs, skipping steps, batching). Logical, business-relevant, no fluff.
  - Structure/Presentation: Clean, independent (no meta-references), well-sectioned with markdown. Follows prompt tasks exactly.
  - Basic SQL queries (4 core ones): Flawless syntax for PostgreSQL. Correct CTEs, `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ...)`, assumes one event per activity/claim (reasonable). Lists claim_ids and diffs for manual outlier spotting.

- **Critical Flaws (major deductions, per strict criteria)**:
  - **SQL syntax/logic errors in additional queries** (severe: ~1.5 deduct):
    - A to C correlation query: Duplicate alias `c` (`close_times c` then `claims c`)  syntax error, query fails.
    - Same query: `SELECT ... c.claim_type` where `c` is `close_times` (no `claim_type` column)  column error, even if alias fixed.
    - P to N correlation: Correct syntax, but minor: Uses `resource` from *Approve* event only as "adjuster" (ignores if Notify uses different resource).
  - **Missing key requirements** (significant: ~1.0 deduct):
    - No filtering for "outside expected ranges" or Z-score outliers (e.g., `WHERE time_diff > 90000 + 3*3600 OR time_diff < 90000 - 3*3600`). Queries dump *all* diffs; user must manually filter. Prompt explicitly demands "identify specific claims where ... falls outside" and "filter by ... immediately after assignment or ... excessively long".
    - Incomplete correlations: Includes `claim_type`/`resource` (good), but ignores prompt's "particular customer or region segments" (no `customer_id`, no `adjusters` JOIN for `region`/`specialization` despite schema provided; `resource` unlinked).
  - **Minor issues** (per strictness, still deduct ~0.3):
    - No handling of multiple events per activity/claim (e.g., `MIN(timestamp)` per activity for first occurrence; assumes singleton).
    - No ZETA-based deviation calc (e.g., `(diff - avg)/stdev > ZETA`).
    - Redundant `notify_times` CTE reused without alias variation.
    - Wrapper as ```python``` (content isn't Python; cosmetic but unnecessary).

- **Overall**: Strong on analysis/hypotheses (9.5/10), good basics (8.5/10), but SQL errors + missing filters/outlier ID make it "not nearly flawless." Equivalent to 85-90% correct, penalized strictly to 7.2. Fixes needed: Correct aliases/SELECTs, add `WHERE` filters (e.g., hardcoded ranges/ZETA), `adjusters` JOINs, `MIN(ts)`, customer/region.
