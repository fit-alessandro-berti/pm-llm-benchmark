**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless in its final statements and conclusions. It accurately identifies **Group B's log** as exhibiting the bias (the adjustments are absent in Group A and explicitly present in Group B for specific cases), correctly attributes the manifestation to the **+10 ScoreAdjustment** triggered by **CommunityGroup = "Highland Civic Darts Club"** (with precise evidence from U001, U003 vs. U002/P002), properly distinguishes the role of **LocalResident** (not causal, as shown by U002), and rigorously explains systematic differences (e.g., lower effective base score threshold for club members in B vs. Group A outcomes like P001/P002). Comparisons are data-driven, inferences about "likely rejected" for unboosted 695 are soundly based on the 710 rejections, and the summary of disparate impact ("double standard") directly addresses the query without overreach, speculation, or contradiction. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws.
