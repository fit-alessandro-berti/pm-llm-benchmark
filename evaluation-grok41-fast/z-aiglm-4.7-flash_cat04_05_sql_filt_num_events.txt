The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and precise DuckDB SQL query that exactly matches the requirements: it uses a subquery to identify `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then filters the full `event_log` rows via `IN` to return only events from qualifying cases. The query preserves all original columns and rows for valid cases, with no extraneous clauses, assumptions, or errors. The explanation is concise, accurate, and directly tied to the query logic without fluff or inaccuracies. No logical flaws, ambiguities, or deviations from the prompt.
