**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It precisely identifies **Group B's log** as exhibiting the bias, with a razor-sharp comparison of P002 (710 rejected) vs. U003 (705 approved post-boost), correctly inferring inconsistent thresholds (~720 for Group A vs. effectively lower for boosted Group B cases). It accurately traces the mechanism to `CommunityGroup` ("Highland Civic Darts Club") triggering `+10 ScoreAdjustment` (absent in Group A due to "None" and `LocalResident=FALSE`), isolates supporting cases (e.g., U002 matching P002 when no boost), and explains systematic differences in decisions as preferential treatment creating disparate impact on the protected group. Terminology ("affinity/in-group bias") fits perfectly as proxy discrimination via local community membership. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, logical gaps, or overreach—evidence is exhaustive yet concise, conclusions directly align with data and query.
