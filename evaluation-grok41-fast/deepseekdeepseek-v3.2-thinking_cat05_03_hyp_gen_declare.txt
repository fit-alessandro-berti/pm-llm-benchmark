**9.0**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies (flawless, 10/10)**: Precisely identifies the core contradiction (noncoexistence E-C vs. required both in flow + existence C), missing enforcements (allows R-C skips), weak responded_existence/precedence (no strict order), and logical implication (forces no E). Fully undermines intended logic without extraneous details.
- **Hypotheses (flawless, 10/10)**: Directly matches/expands examples (misinterpretation, incremental changes, data/technical issues, pressure/skipping). Concise, plausible, tied to anomalies.
- **Verification Approaches (strong but deducts, 8/10)**: 
  - SQL 1-4: Accurate, directly test key anomalies (C w/o E, E+C, E w/o A, A-after-E). Postgres-correct, efficient EXISTS/JOINs.
  - SQL 5: **Major flaw** (-1.5): `COUNT(DISTINCT activity) = COUNT(*)` requires *exactly* 2 events (one R, one C), excluding valid "only R/C" traces with duplicates/multiples (possible per schema). BOOL_AND + COUNT(DISTINCT)=2 suffices for "only R/C present"; extra condition breaks purpose.
  - SQL 6: **Minor flaw** (-0.5): Off-topic for DECLARE anomalies (verifies adjuster-claim_type match, unmentioned in model/flow). Useful bonus but dilutes focus; assumptive LIKE patterns brittle (e.g., "home_insurance" matches '%home%').
  - Missing: init (non-R starts), full existence C absence, but examples covered; not fatal.
- **Overall Structure/Clarity (flawless, 10/10)**: Independent sections, no leaks/hints, concise, actionable.
- **Strict Penalty Rationale**: SQL 5 inaccuracy = "logical flaw" (significant deduction per instructions); SQL 6 irrelevance = minor. 90% perfection threshold met, but not "nearly flawless."
