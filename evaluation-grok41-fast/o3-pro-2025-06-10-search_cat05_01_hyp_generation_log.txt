**10.0**

This prompt is exemplary and fully aligns with the target requirements. It precisely encourages anomaly detection, hypothesis formation, and SQL query proposal without any hints, guidance, or leading specifics about the data's issues (e.g., no mention of out-of-order events, missing steps, or specific cases like 1002/1004). 

- **Structure and Coverage**: Sections A/B/C map 1:1 to the desired tasks; output format ensures traceability via numbering; constraints enforce data-driven, hint-free reasoning.
- **Technical Precision**: PostgreSQL-specific, schema-compliant (references only provided tables/columns), executable queries emphasized with placeholders; no reliance on external info.
- **Open-Endedness**: Relies solely on provided schema/data/happy path; professional tone maintained; no canned solutions or accusations.
- **No Flaws**: Zero inaccuracies (happy path restated accurately from schema), unclarities (clear headings/instructions), or logical issues (e.g., encourages ranking hypotheses, business impacts, evidence-gathering SQL). Minor formatting (e.g., happy path bullets) is inconsequential in a code block. Reusable as-is, audit-ready, and optimally prompts reasoning without spoon-feeding.
