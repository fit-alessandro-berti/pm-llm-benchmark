**9.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Hypercritical Assessment):
- **Query Correctness (Perfect: +10/10)**: The SQL query is logically flawless and precisely meets the requirements. It correctly identifies `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via a non-correlated subquery, then filters the full `event_log` to return *all events* (via `SELECT *`) only for those cases. No data loss for qualifying cases, no inclusion of disqualifying cases. Handles grouping accurately, works in DuckDB (standard SQL), and preserves row order if needed (though unspecified). No syntax errors, no off-by-one (">6" correctly as "<=6"), no assumptions about data types or indexes.
  
- **Completeness and Clarity of Query (Strong: +9.5/10)**: Query is concise, readable, and self-contained. No unnecessary columns or computations.

- **Explanation Accuracy (Major Deduction: -1.5 total)**:
  - Core description ("identifies all `case_id`s ... returns all columns ... preserving all events") is accurate (+1).
  - **Critical inaccuracy**: Describes it as a "correlated subquery." This is factually wrong—it's an independent (non-correlated) subquery with no outer reference. This is a clear SQL terminology error, demonstrating imprecise understanding. Minor? No—strict policy demands significant penalty for any inaccuracy.
  - Rest of explanation reinforces correctness without flaws.

- **Extraneous Content (Minor Ding: -0.5)**: The offer for "event count per case" or "optimized for large logs" is polite but irrelevant—task specifies exact output ("full set of events"), not extras. Introduces unasked scope creep, implying the provided query is insufficient. Could confuse or distract.

- **Overall Polish (Strong: +9/10)**: Formatted well, directly addresses task, no verbosity.

**Why not 10.0?** Not "nearly flawless"—the terminology error is an unambiguous inaccuracy (not nitpicky; it's a definitional mistake). No logical flaws in execution, but explanation undermines perfection. 9.0 reflects excellence with strict deduction for the flaw. Equivalent alternatives (e.g., CTE, window `COUNT() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)`) exist but aren't required; this is equally valid.
