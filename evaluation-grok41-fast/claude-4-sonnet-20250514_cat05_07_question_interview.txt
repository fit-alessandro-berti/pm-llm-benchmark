**10.0**

### Evaluation Summary
This answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It fully adheres to the prompt by delivering a comprehensive series of **20 targeted, open-ended questions** that precisely uncover missing details (e.g., thresholds, metrics), decision criteria (e.g., Q4-6), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q7-9), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q1-3,15-17), and exception handling (e.g., Q10-12). Additional relevant categories (communication, timing/performance, quality control) logically extend the process without straying, directly tying back to the description's elements (e.g., inspections, audits, stakeholders, tools).

- **No inaccuracies**: Every question accurately reflects or probes the description (e.g., Q2 on inspector issues, Q11 on custom clauses).
- **No unclarities**: Questions are precise, professional, and phrased for elaboration (e.g., "walk me through," "what triggers," "how do you balance").
- **No logical flaws**: Logical progression via categories; no overlaps/redundancy; avoids binaries (minor yes/no subparts in Q1/3 are embedded in open probes); no off-topic drifts, SQL, or tech implementation.
- **Strengths elevating to perfection**: Exhaustive coverage of all prompt goals; scalable to "large-scale" context; enhances conceptual depth without assuming/leading.

Zero deductions—even the most pedantic review finds no minor issues warranting a penalty.
