**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—structured, insightful, and directly aligned with the prompt (anomalies identified organically from data vs. normal flow; plausible hypotheses covering system/policy/training/fraud angles; 7 targeted PostgreSQL queries using CTEs, window functions, pivots, and joins appropriately). It extrapolates beyond samples to full-dataset investigations without hints. **Nearly flawless**, but deducted 0.8 for:
- **Major flaw (Query 7 - logical error, -0.5):** Self-join on same `resource` guarantees `r1.role == r2.role` and `r1.department == r2.department`, so `WHERE r1.role != r2.role OR r1.department != r2.department` **always false**. Query returns empty; fails hypothesis (conflicting activities by same resource). Intent clear (cross-dept tasks), but code broken—unacceptable for "investigative" query.
- **Minor issues (-0.3 total):**
  - Query 3: Data-driven "primary_dept" clever but brittle (relies on sample frequencies; rare activity/dept skews "expected"). No mismatches in provided data, so underperforms hypothesis slightly; still valid.
  - Query 5: Arbitrary `>1000` threshold (sample-based, ok) but unparameterized; ignores `order_type` nuance (e.g., 'priority' might waive checks).
  - Anomalies sec. 3: Examples emphasize timing over pure role mismatches (none glaring in data, e.g., all `Receive Payment` by Finance Cashier)—slightly unfocused.
  - No query leverages `additional_info` (e.g., `credit_score<700` + high value, or `shipment_scheduled=N` + Ship Goods)—missed opportunity for deeper anomalies like fraud flags.
  - Hyper-minor: Query 1 `ELSE 99` handles extras but could flag them explicitly; Query 2 assumes all mandatory (per flow) without `order_type` variance.

No inaccuracies in anomaly spotting (all 1002-1004 issues nailed, incl. misses/timing); hypotheses rigorous; queries syntactically perfect/efficient for Postgres; output clear/usable. One fatal query logic flaw prevents 10.0, but excellence elsewhere justifies high score.
