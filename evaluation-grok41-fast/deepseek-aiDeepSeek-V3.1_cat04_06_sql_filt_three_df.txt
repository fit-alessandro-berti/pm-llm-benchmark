The provided answer is nearly flawless. Both SQL queries correctly identify cases containing the exact consecutive sequence ('Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order') with no intervening events and >5 days between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order', then exclude all events from those cases while returning all events from remaining cases. 

- **Self-join approach**: Precisely uses temporal joins and correlated `NOT EXISTS` to enforce direct succession (immediate consecutiveness) and the timing filter. Handles multiples correctly via `DISTINCT`. No logical flaws.
- **Window function approach**: Elegantly uses `LEAD()` to check exact next-two activities and timestamps, inherently enforcing direct succession. More efficient, as noted.
- Both use DuckDB-compatible syntax (`INTERVAL '5 days'`, window functions).
- Final result correctly excludes entire bad cases, selects all columns (`e.*`), and adds sensible `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` for readability (aligns with "proper ordering").
- Explanation is clear, accurate, and highlights strengths without errors.

No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or minor issues detected. Providing alternatives enhances value without detracting. Perfect match to requirements.
