**2.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Major Logical Flaw (always_before - Fatal Error, -4.0)**: Completely incorrect semantics. The tuples like `('Receive Order', 'Check Availability')` mean *if RO occurs, CA must precede RO*, which is impossible in the described sequence (RO is first). This renders the entire Log Skeleton invalid—no non-empty trace satisfies it. This misapplies the definition ("if first occurs, second previously"), confusing it with "always after" or precedence. Explanation doubles down on error, claiming it enforces "each activity must occur before the next," directly contradicting the provided definition.
- **Redundant/Wrong Usage (always_after empty - Minor but flawed, -0.5)**: Explanation claims "not applicable" due to "strictly sequential," but forward tuples belong here for *if early occurs, late follows*. Direct-follows already covers order, making always_after optional but not "inapplicable."
- **directly_follows (Correct, +2.0)**: Properly captures strict linear direct succession matching the scenario's sequential description.
- **activ_freq (Mostly correct, +1.5)**: `{1}` for all assumes mandatory exact-once per case, reasonable for "must be processed through a series," but unproven—e.g., RP ("once the customer pays") implies potential 0 occurrences if unpaid; IC/RP could post-case. Minor unclarity: no {0,1} for optionals, but scenario linear.
- **equivalence, never_together (Correctly empty, +1.0)**: No evidence for these; accurate.
- **Code Syntax/Structure (Correct, +1.0)**: Valid Python dict/sets; full activity names consistent; proper tuple format.
- **Explanation (Poor, -1.0)**: Reinforces errors (wrong always_before logic; dismisses always_after); overclaims "strictly sequential" without justifying direct_follows necessity (scenario implies order, not immediacy).
- **Overall Completeness (Partial, -1.0)**: Captures linear flow intent but broken by contradictory constraint; misses nuances like potential IC/RP asynchrony (post-D?).

**Base 10  Deducted to 2.0**: Major invalid constraint dominates; not "nearly flawless"—fundamentally broken representation. Structure salvages minimal score; zero would be non-Pythonic garbage.
