The answer is nearly flawless: accurate identification of Group B as biased, precise dissection of manifestations with correct data pulls (e.g., raw scores, specific +5 boosts, threshold inference from 60not hired vs. 63/65hired), compelling cross-group comparisons (U001 vs. U002/P002; U003 vs. P002 with objective superiority on all raw metrics), and comprehensive, logically sound implications tying to meritocracy, indirect discrimination via disparate impact on non-locals, cultural fit subjectivity, and transparency risks. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws; all inferences are data-driven and unassailable. Structure enhances clarity without excess.
