**9.4**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
This answer is exceptionally strong—comprehensive, well-structured, logical, and directly addresses all prompt requirements with enriched output, chronological sorting, full attribute integration, origin indicators, and per-event reasoning. It correctly prioritizes Log A timestamps as primary, includes both timestamps where relevant, handles unmatched events perfectly (Quality Check as B-only, Item Delivered as A-only), and covers *all* events without loss or invention. The table format is clear and professional. Event mappings are semantically sound, and sorting is flawless.

**Minor Deductions (strictly applied, preventing 10.0):**
- **Tolerance specification inaccuracy (-0.4)**: Prompt explicitly suggests "less than 2 seconds" as the example for "small timestamp tolerance." Answer arbitrarily sets "+/- 5 seconds," which is 2.5x larger. This is applied to match Payment (exactly 5s diff, acknowledged as "at the edge"), Order Received/Shipped (2s diffs, not "<2s"), despite 1s match for Validation being perfect. While prompt uses "e.g." (illustrative), stating and using a looser tolerance is a deviation; hypercritically, it risks over-matching (e.g., PaymentCheck vs. Payment Processed could be distinct steps—"check" precedes "processed"). Justification via notes/context is good but doesn't excuse overriding the guided threshold.
- **Borderline semantic stretch (-0.2)**: Payment mapping is reasonable but not "clear synonym" like others (Processed implies success post-Check); prompt requires "confidently match," and 5s + name variance arguably warrants separation under strict <2s. Minor unclarity in table nulls (*null* asterisks are informal vs. blank/null).

No other flaws: no logical gaps, no missing events/attributes, no chronological errors, no unclarities in reasoning/output, perfect primary timeline adherence, excellent documentation. Truly near-flawless; tiny adherence issues prevent perfection.
