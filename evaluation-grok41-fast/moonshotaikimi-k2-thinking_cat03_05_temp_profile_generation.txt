The final output is a valid, well-structured Python dictionary precisely matching the required format: keys are tuples of the exact activity labels (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`), values are `(average_time, standard_deviation)` tuples in seconds, consistent with the example. It includes a representative subset of 25 pairs (not exhaustive, avoiding bloat while ensuring complexity), covering all 9 direct successors plus multi-step pairs (2-step: 8, 3-step: 5, 5-step: 2, end-to-end: 1), with logical precedence respecting the described supply chain flow (SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS). Times are realistically estimated for high-tech electronics (short: ~hours for handoffs/automation; medium: days for manufacturing/testing; long: weeks/months for procurement/distribution), with stdevs appropriately scaled (low ~20% for predictable steps, high ~33% for variable ones like lead times). Cumulative times are internally consistent (e.g., `('SS', 'RC')`  `('SS', 'OP')` + `('OP', 'RC')`; `('SS', 'AS')` ~50 days end-to-end). Comments and summary enhance clarity without extraneous content, directly reinforcing complexity (varying scales, variability, separations). No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, reverse pairs, invalid units, syntax errors, or missing elements—nearly flawless execution.
