**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is strong in core analysis (identifying the +10 community affiliation adjustment as the primary bias mechanism, correctly noting its application only to "Highland Civic Darts Club" members among locals in C001/C004, and linking it to outcomes where lower final scores approve vs. higher ones reject, e.g., C004 at 700 Approved vs. C003 at 715 Rejected). It aptly discusses implications for non-affiliated/non-locals (requiring superior base scores to compensate, undermining merit-based equity). Structure is clear, evidence cited from log, recommendations relevant (if unasked). Conclusion sharp.

**However, strict deductions for flaws (even minor = significant impact):**
- **Logical/presentation flaws in table (major, -1.0)**: Attribute rows for "Local Resident" and "Community Group" selectively omit counterexamples (e.g., C002: local/no-group Approved at 720; C005: non-local/no-group Approved at 740), weakening "systematic bias" claim. "High Score" rows are incoherent/unlogical: C003 (715) listed as "unfavorable" under 740 and "favorable" under 715 (despite rejection); doesn't fit "Favorable/Unfavorable Group" schema. Creates unclarity/confusion.
- **Logical inaccuracy in "Critical Inconsistency" (-0.5)**: Claims C003 (715) vs. C005 (740) as inconsistent despite "same criteria," but 715 < 740 *expects* different outcomes in score-based system (reject lower, approve higher). "Despite C003 having a lower score" phrasing implies paradox where none exists; real inconsistency is vs. C004 (700), not here. Misattributes as residency bias evidence when it's score-consistent.
- **Minor inaccuracy in math/example (-0.2)**: "10-point bonus outweighs 25 points" – preliminary gap C003 (715) vs. C004 (690) is 25, but *final* is 15 (715 vs. 700); conflates stages without clarifying.
- **Overstatement/minor overclaim (-0.1)**: Intro/sections broadly assert "bias favors local residents" unqualifiedly, despite C005 counterexample and C002 (local/no-bonus Approved). "Structural bias"/"privilege tier" interpretive but evidence-based; still hyperbolic without quantifying (e.g., all Darts cases local).
- **Unasked extras (-0.0, neutral)**: Recommendations insightful, no deduction.

**Net: Near-high (8+) for flawless core bias ID/implications, but flaws prevent 9+ "nearly flawless." Equivalent to A- under strict rubric.**
