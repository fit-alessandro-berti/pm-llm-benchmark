**3.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Structure Only)
- **Major Semantic Inaccuracy (Fitness Failure, -4.0 penalty)**: The proposed loop `* ( 'Request Missing Info (RMI)', 'Validate Form (VF)' )` uses incorrect loop semantics per the definition. It mandates 1 "RMI", always starts with "RMI", permits only "RMI (VFRMI)*" patterns (ending in "RMI"), and forbids consecutive "RMIRMI" or ending in "VF" without a trailing "RMI". This fails Case 1 ("RMIVF"), Case 3 ("RMIRMIVF"), and Case 2 (no "RMI" at all, but loop forces 1). Zero replay fitness; model rejects all traces.
- **Structural Flaw (Forced Mandatory Loop, -2.0 penalty)**: Positioned directly after "AE" in sequence, loop is non-skippable (no XOR/optional branch). Case 2 (AEAD) impossible.
- **Notation Inconsistency (-0.5 penalty)**: `->` depicted as n-ary (6 children in inner seq), but prompt/example shows binary `-> (A, B)` requiring explicit nesting (e.g., `-> (VF, -> (AE, ...))`). Flat list misrepresents valid ProcessTree construction.
- **Incomplete Capture of Repetitions (-0.3 penalty)**: Claims to handle "repetitions of RMI and VF", but cannot produce observed "RMIRMIVF" or multiple pre-VF "RMI"s.
- **Minor Clarity Issues (-0.0, as textual but flawed)**: Visual/explanation verbose but consistent internally; no tau/silent steps needed but absent where optional skip might require.

Partial credit for correct main sequence (RAVFAEADSCAC), identifying loop intent post-AE, and simplicity. No credit for precision (overgeneralizes invalid traces like "RMIVFRMIexit"). Total: fundamentally broken model.
