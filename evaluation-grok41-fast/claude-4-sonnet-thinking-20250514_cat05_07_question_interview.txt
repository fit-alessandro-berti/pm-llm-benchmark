**10.0**

This answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It delivers exactly what the prompt requires: a well-structured list of 17 targeted, open-ended questions that systematically probe missing details (e.g., Q16 on tracking), decision criteria (e.g., Q3, Q10), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q3, Q12), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q7, Q15), and exceptions (e.g., Q5, Q8, Q13, Q14). Questions align precisely with process phases from the description, using section headers for clarity without adding fluff. No requests for SQL, code, or implementation; all deepen conceptual understanding. Phrasing is consistently interviewee-directed, professional, and open-ended (minor embedded yes/no elements like Q1's second clause are negligible as they invite elaboration and do not dominate). No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, redundancies, or off-topic drifts—comprehensive coverage without excess (17 questions are justified by process complexity). The closing sentence reinforces intent without violating instructions. Perfection in structure, relevance, and adherence.
