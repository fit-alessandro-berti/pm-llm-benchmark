**3.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies Identification (Major Flaws, ~20% credit)**: Fundamentally misunderstands DECLARE constraints. Claims model *allows* violations (e.g., C without R despite init(R) and precedence(R,C); E after C despite noncoexistence(E,C); no enforcement of responded_existence(AE)). Real anomalies include: (1) noncoexistence(E,C) forbids intended traces with both (core contradiction, as existence(C)=1.0 and responded_existence(A,E) force E if A occurs, but A is expected); (2) missing full sequence enforcement (e.g., allows RC skipping A/E/P/N); (3) redundancy/over-constraint (precedence(R,C) redundant with init(R)). Answer inverts model logic, fabricates "model allows X" where rules forbid it. Logical flaws penalize heavily.
- **Hypotheses (Strong, ~90% credit)**: Closely matches prompt examples (misinterpretation, technical/data issues, incremental changes, efficiency pressure). Clear, relevant, no inaccuracies.
- **SQL Verification (Catastrophic Flaws, ~5% credit)**: All 4 queries are syntactically valid but *semantically broken*—subqueries like `MAX/MIN(activity) ... IS NULL` never return NULL (always a string like 'C'/'E' if rows exist, due to outer WHERE activity='C'/'E'). They return empty/false results always, failing to detect anything. No timestamp ordering (critical for sequences like E after C, E without prior A). No proper EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, window functions, or CTEs for traces. Ignores adjusters/customers. Unusable for "verification approaches"—core task failure.
- **Overall Structure/Clarity (~70% credit)**: Well-formatted, independent sections, no hints leaked. Concise. But content dominates; inaccuracies/logical errors permeate tasks 1/3.
- **Strict Adjustments**: -2.0 for broken SQL (non-functional); -1.5 for inverted anomalies; -1.0 for misstating responded_existence semantics ("E only after A" implies precedence(A,E), not standard responded_existence(AE)); -0.3 minor (no P/N coverage, generic phrasing). Not "nearly flawless"—major rewrites needed.
