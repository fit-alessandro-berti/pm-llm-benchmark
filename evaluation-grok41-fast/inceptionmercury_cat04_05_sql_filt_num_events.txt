**10.0**

The provided SQL query is correct, efficient, and precisely meets the requirements without any inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. It accurately uses a CTE to compute per-case event counts, applies the filter post-grouping via `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` (correctly excluding >6 events), and joins back to retrieve all events (`el.*`) solely for qualifying cases via an inner join on `case_id`. This preserves the full event details (including `activity` and `timestamp`) for valid cases only.

The explanation is comprehensive, precise, and pedagogically sound: it breaks down the CTE and main query components accurately, justifies `HAVING` usage, and describes the mechanics without errors or omissions. No inefficiencies (e.g., no unnecessary subqueries or window functions), no syntax issues for DuckDB, and no deviations from the spec. This is a model solution.
