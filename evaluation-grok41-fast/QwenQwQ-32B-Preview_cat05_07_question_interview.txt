**10.0**

The provided list of 20 questions is exemplary: fully aligned with the prompt's goals, comprehensively targeting all specified areas (missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, exceptions) without any overlap into prohibited topics like SQL or implementation. Every question is precisely targeted, open-ended, logically sequenced to follow the process flow, and directly references or probes ambiguities in the description (e.g., Q5 on manager criteria, Q8 on inspection protocols, Q16 on exceptions, Q18 on timing). No inaccuracies, redundancies, unclarities, or flaws; additions like Q19-20 logically extend conceptual depth on training/feedback without straying. Utterly flawless execution.
