**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (Supporting High Base Score)**:
  - **Perfect adherence to core prompt**: All questions are open-ended, targeted, and focused on conceptual deepening (missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, exceptions). Comprehensive coverage maps directly to the process description (e.g., docs, assignment logic, inspections, screening, audits, handoffs). No SQL, code, or overtly technical implementation requests anywhere except the flagged section.
  - **Structure and clarity**: Thematic grouping with headings enhances usability; concise, professional phrasing; strong intro/concluding summary. Total ~25 questions form a logical "series" without redundancy.
  - **Depth and relevance**: Uncovers variabilities (e.g., city differences, discretion vs. rules), exceptions (e.g., custom clauses, repairs), sequencing (e.g., audit stages), metrics (SLAs/KPIs)—flawlessly probes ambiguities in the description.
  - **No logical flaws or inaccuracies**: Questions accurately reference description (e.g., quotes like “outdated”, “activated”) without misinterpretation. Hypotheticals (e.g., "recent example") are process-oriented.

- **Flaws (Strict Deductions, Preventing 9+)**:
  - **Major issue: Section 12 ("System Integration") violates "no implementation details" rule (1.5-point deduction)**: Questions like "what specific data triggers this activation", "source of truth for property status", and "changes... communicated across systems" shift from *conceptual process* (e.g., steps to activation) to technical/systems architecture. Original description mentions tools (database, portal, CRMs) descriptively, but probing "triggers" and "source of truth" seeks implementation specifics, not pure process understanding. This is a dedicated section (2 questions), not trivial—directly contravenes prompt.
  - **Minor issues (cumulative 0.3-point deduction)**:
    - Q3: "the system (or team)" and "scoring mechanism" mildly risks implying tech implementation (e.g., software algo), though saved by "or team"/focus on decision logic.
    - Overly exhaustive length (~25 sub-questions): Efficient but borders on overwhelming for an "interviewee series"; prompt implies concise probing, not exhaustive audit.
    - Q8: Hypothetical "automated system" is fine but echoes tech slightly in a process question.
  - **No unclarities**: All questions crystal-clear, interviewee-friendly.

- **Overall**: Near-flawless (90%+ ideal), but Section 12's rule violation is a clear, non-minor inaccuracy warranting deduction under "hypercritical" strictness. Equivalent to A- work: exceptional but not unimpeachable. 10.0 requires zero infractions.
