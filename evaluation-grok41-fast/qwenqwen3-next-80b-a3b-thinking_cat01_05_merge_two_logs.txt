**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Near-Flawless Elements)**:
  - **Output Format & Completeness**: Table perfectly integrates all attributes from both logs (e.g., `timestamp_A`, `event_type` from Log A; `timestamp_B`, `event_name`, `user_id`, `resource_id`, `notes` from Log B). Blanks for missing data clearly indicate origin (merged, Log A-only, Log B-only). Chronological order is flawless: primary reliance on `timestamp_A` (Log A as primary timeline), fallback to `timestamp_B` for Log B-only events, resulting in correct sequence (10:00:00  10:01:30  10:02:00  10:02:05  10:03:00  10:05:00  10:20:00).
  - **Matching Accuracy**: 
    - Order Received/OrderReceived (2s diff): Semantic match correct; attributes fully combined.
    - Order Validated/OrderValidation (1s diff): Perfect (<2s, semantic match).
    - Payment Processed vs. PaymentCheck (5s diff): Correctly not merged (exceeds tolerance); treats as distinct (semantic + timing justification).
    - Item Shipped/Shipping (2s diff): Semantic match correct; attributes combined.
    - Standalone events (Item Delivered, PaymentCheck, Quality Check): Correctly included with origin indicated, no over-merging.
  - **Reasoning Documentation**: Exhaustive, structured, and precise. Covers every event, timestamp diffs explicitly, semantic mappings (e.g., "Item Shipped"  "Shipping"), conflict resolutions (e.g., 5s gap + "gateway delay" notes explain distinction), and decisions (e.g., Log A primary, tolerance handling). No ambiguities; logical and evidence-based.
  - **Enrichment & Conflicts**: All attributes preserved/included; timestamps both shown for merged events (per "include both"); no data loss or invention.

- **Minor Inaccuracies/Flaws (Deductions)**:
  - **Tolerance Interpretation (Primary Ding, -0.5)**: Prompt specifies "less than 2 seconds" explicitly. Answer merges two events at *exactly* 2s (Order Received: 10:00:00 - 09:59:58 = 2s; Item Shipped: 10:05:02 - 10:05:00 = 2s), calling it "within tolerance" via "conservative interpretation." Strictly, 2s  <2s (logical flaw per prompt's wording). While justified (system offsets, second-level precision), this violates the rule as stated. No merge = more standalones, but answer's choice is intuitively correct yet not "flawless."
  - **Table Rendering (-0.1)**: Minor visual: Log B-only rows have blank `timestamp_A`/`event_type` but filled `order_id` (consistent, but could explicitly note "N/A" or "(Log B-only)" for ultra-clarity; blanks are clear enough).
  - **Semantic Overreach (-0.1)**: Reasoning implies "Payment Processed" = completion, "PaymentCheck" = preliminary (good inference from notes), but prompt requires *combination of order_id + timing* primacy; semantics are secondary. Slight stretch, though well-supported.
  - **No Over-Penalization for Think Step**: Ignored per instructions (verbose but corrects to solid final).

- **Why Not 10.0?**: Not "nearly flawless" due to tolerance violation (core matching criterion; affects 2/7 events). Hypercritical: This is a direct logical inaccuracy, warranting deduction despite excellence elsewhere.
- **Why Not Lower?**: Fixes all other aspects perfectly (no misses, no false merges, full documentation). 9.2 reflects ~92% perfection: outstanding but with pinpointable rule deviation.
