The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and fully compliant DuckDB SQL query using a CTE to compute event counts per `case_id`, filter for those with `event_count <= 6`, and return all events (`SELECT *`) from qualifying cases via an `IN` subquery. This precisely matches the requirements: identifies counts via `GROUP BY case_id` and `COUNT(*)`, excludes `case_id`s >6 events using `WHERE event_count <= 6`, and returns the full event set for remaining cases. Syntax is valid for DuckDB, readable, and optimal. Explanations are accurate, structured, and reinforce correctness without extraneous elements. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, inefficiencies, or deviations detected.
