The provided answer is flawless. Both queries correctly identify cases with 6 events and return all events from those cases, using standard SQL fully compatible with DuckDB. The CTE+JOIN approach outputs exactly the original columns (`el.*`). The window function approach outputs original columns plus one computed column (`events_per_case`), which is a harmless addition (still functionally correct and common in such patterns) that does not alter the required data; it could be excluded via explicit column list if schema were fully known, but given "at least" specified columns, `*` is appropriate. Both satisfy the exact requirements: grouping/counting per `case_id`, filtering >6 out, returning full events for 6. Explanations are precise, accurate (including efficiency note), and structured. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, inefficiencies, or extraneous elements. Unnecessary but helpful `ORDER BY` is consistent and low-risk. Dual approaches demonstrate depth without overcomplication.
