**8.2**

### Explanation of Grade (for transparency, not part of response)
- **Strengths (pushing toward high score):** Precisely identifies bias introduction in steps 3 (explicit rule-based adjustment via proxy traits) and 4 (human discretion amplifying it), with clear mechanisms, table for clarity. Thoroughly discusses justifiability (business rationale vs. legal/ethical risks, including disparate impact/ECOA accurately). Implications for fairness/equity well-covered (unequal treatment, cycles of inequality, amplification). Recommendations practical and forward-looking. Conclusion balanced yet incisive, directly addressing non-protected favoring. Structure enhances readability; no major omissions.
- **Flaws deducting points (hypercritical deductions):** 
  - Minor inaccuracy: Cites "FINRA" alongside ECOA; FINRA regulates securities firms, not primarily lending/ECOA compliance (CFPB/Fed more relevant—0.3 deduction).
  - Logical flaw in math: Impact ratio formula \(\frac{\text{Approval rate}_{\text{Local}}}{\text{Approval rate}_{\text{Non-local}}}\) with "<0.8 warrants investigation" is inverted. For detecting adverse impact on non-locals (disadvantaged group), standard 80% rule requires \(\frac{\text{Non-local}}{\text{Local}} < 0.8\); as written, it flags the opposite scenario (-0.8 deduction). Even if illustrative, it's not merely minor—it's a core analytical tool presented confidently.
  - Slight overstatement: Table claims no "objective evidence" for correlation, but process notes "perceived (though not formally proven)" and business rationale assumes historical data—framing as "**only**" because of "lender’s experience base" edges interpretive (-0.2).
  - Verbose in places (e.g., table phrasing repetitive), but not penalized per instructions ignoring verbosity.
- **Overall:** Nearly flawless in core analysis (90%+ coverage), but inaccuracies/logical issues prevent 9+ under strict criteria. Equivalent to A- work.
