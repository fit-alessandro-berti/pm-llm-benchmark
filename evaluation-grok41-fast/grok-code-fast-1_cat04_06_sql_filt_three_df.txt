**10.0**

The provided SQL query is correct, complete, and precisely meets all requirements without any inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities:

- **Sequence detection**: The `triples` CTE accurately identifies direct succession using `rn`, `rn+1`, `rn+2` with exact activity matches, ensuring no intervening events.
- **Timing filter**: Correctly computes `ts_confirm - ts_create > INTERVAL '5 days'` (valid DuckDB syntax for timestamp intervals) and captures only the relevant pair per triple.
- **Exclusion logic**: `bad_cases` uses `DISTINCT case_id` to exclude entire cases if *any* matching sequence exceeds 5 days, aligning perfectly with the prompt's criteria (cases with the sequence *and* >5 days timing).
- **Final output**: Returns **all events** (`SELECT *`) from non-excluded cases, filtered via `NOT IN`, with proper `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` for chronological clarity per case.
- Handles edge cases implicitly (e.g., multiple triples per case, no sequences, 5 days sequences).
- Efficient use of CTEs; no unnecessary computations or joins.

The explanation reinforces correctness without errors. No penalties apply.
