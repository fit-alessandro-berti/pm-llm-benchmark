**10.0**

The final POWL structure is precise, accurate, and fully captures the event log's behaviors without inaccuracies, over- or under-modeling. The loop semantics exactly match the observed repetitions (e.g., `*(AS, IQC)` generates AS;(IQC;AS)* for 0+ rework iterations, covering Case 4's skip and others' multiples; similarly for testing). The XOR with tau perfectly handles optional LB. The StrictPartialOrder enforces the correct linear sequencing (no unneeded concurrency). Notation is clear and consistent with pm4py POWL definitions. Validation against all cases is implicit and correct; no logical flaws, ambiguities, or omissions.
