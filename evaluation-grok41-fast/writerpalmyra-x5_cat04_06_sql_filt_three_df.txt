**10.0**

The provided SQL query is logically flawless, precisely meets all requirements, and demonstrates optimal use of DuckDB features with no inaccuracies, inefficiencies, ambiguities, or edge-case oversights. 

### Key Strengths (Confirming Near-Perfection):
- **Sequence Detection**: LAG(1) and LAG(2) over `PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp` correctly identifies *direct succession* (no intervening events), exactly as specified. It anchors on `'Confirm Order'` rows where the immediate prior is `'Create Order'` and the one before is `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`.
- **Timing Filter**: `EXTRACT(epoch FROM (timestamp - prev_timestamp)) / 86400 > 5` accurately computes days between `'Create Order'` (prev_timestamp) and `'Confirm Order'` (timestamp), using standard DuckDB interval-to-seconds conversion.
- **Case Identification**: `DISTINCT case_id` captures cases with *at least one* matching sequence+timing, correctly handling multiples per case.
- **Exclusion Logic**: `NOT EXISTS` efficiently excludes *all events* from matching cases, returning only events from non-matching cases—precisely per the prompt.
- **Completeness**: Returns `e.*` (all columns/events), no unnecessary ordering/grouping imposed (prompt doesn't require it).
- **Performance/Style**: Window functions are efficient; CTEs are clear and modular. No redundant computations.

### Hypercritical Review (No Deductions Needed):
- No timestamp tie-handling issues (assumes log integrity, as implied).
- No false positives (conditions are conjunctive: sequence *and* >5 days).
- No over-filtering/under-filtering (e.g., cases with sequence but 5 days are retained).
- Explanation is precise, concise, and reinforces correctness without extraneous content.
- Minor formatting (e.g., double spaces in explanation) is cosmetic and irrelevant to query function.

This is a benchmark exemplar: correct, concise, and robust. No tweaks required.
