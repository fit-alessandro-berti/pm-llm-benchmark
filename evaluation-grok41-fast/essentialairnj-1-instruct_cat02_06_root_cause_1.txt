**2.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
- **Major Execution Failure (Fatal Bug, -4.0 points)**: The core calculation `df['Resolution Time'] = (df.groupby('Case ID').apply(...)).reset_index(level=0, drop=True)` produces a Series of length 5 (one per case), but `df` has ~33 rows. This raises `ValueError: Length of values (5) does not match length of index (33)`. The code crashes and produces no output. Invalid approach; should use `transform`, `merge`, or group-level computation with `map`. Near-flawless answers must execute correctly.
- **Flawed Methodology for Task 1 (-1.5 points)**: Even if fixed, `> 2 * median_resolution_time` is arbitrary and incorrect. Durations: 101 (~135min), 103 (~80min), 104 (~1450min), 102 (~1510min), 105 (~2945min). Median ~1450min; threshold ~2900min identifies *only* 105. Misses 102/104 (also 20x+ longer than shorts). No justification for "2x median" (outlier-skewed); better: mean of shorts (~107min), IQR, or visual outlier detection. Fails to identify *all* long cases (102, 104, 105).
- **Inadequate Root Cause Analysis for Task 2 (-1.5 points)**: No computation of inter-activity waits (e.g., 102: 150min assignescalate, 150min escalateinvestigate; 104: 210min assigninvestigate; 105: ~28h escalateinvestigate). Ignores patterns like post-escalation delays or overnight gaps. `escalation_analysis` is meaningless activity counts in "long" cases (duplicates rows, no comparison to shorts). Escalations correlate with delays (102/105 have them; 104 lacks but has long L1 wait), but unanalyzed.
- **Incomplete, Superficial, and Inaccurate Output for Task 3 (-1.0 points)**: Prints duplicate rows per case (unpolished). "Analysis" is raw counts, no insights. Recommendations cut off mid-sentence; partial text blames "long triage times" (false—all triages <30min) and L1 agents (irrelevant; delays post-assign/escalate). No explanation of *how* factors increase cycle time (e.g., escalations  specialized queue backlog  multi-day waits). No recommendations (e.g., reduce escalations via L1 training, parallel investigation, SLA monitoring).
- **Structural/Completeness Issues (-0.5 points)**: Response is raw, unpolished code + truncated prints, not structured text addressing 1/2/3 explicitly. Data hardcoded correctly (+minor), timestamps parsed ok, but no summary stats (mean/median per case), visualizations, or case-specific breakdowns. Assumes Python env (not specified).
- **Minor Issues (-0.5 points)**: `longest_times` sorts duplicates redundantly. `long_causes` redundant. No handling of multi-day spans explicitly. Unclear "significantly longer" without stats.

**Total: 10 - 9.0 = 1.0 base +1.0 for correct data load/time parse/effort = 2.0**. Not "nearly flawless"; broken, incomplete, inaccurate. Unusable for real analysis.
