**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless: it correctly identifies all violating cases (2, 3, 5) and compliant ones (1, 4), with precise, textual-description-referenced explanations that resolve ambiguities logically (e.g., strict branching after Check inventory; mandatory Package in sufficient path per "only after packaged... appropriate to Ship"; no fulfillment post-Cancel). No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws; interpretations align perfectly with prescriptive language ("should only occur," "never," "expected flow," "illogical"). Structure is clear and comprehensive; minor stylistic choices (e.g., sequence shorthand) are unambiguous. Hypercritical review finds zero deductibles.
