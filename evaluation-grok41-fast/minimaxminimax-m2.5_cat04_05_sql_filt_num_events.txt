**4.2**

### Critical Evaluation Summary
- **Major flaws (syntax/invalid SQL)**: The primary query has garbled, invalid syntax in the JOIN ON clause ("ON_id = c.c     e.casease_id;"), rendering it unrunnable. This alone warrants severe deduction as the "concise solution" fails fundamentally.
- **Logical/accuracy issues**: Explanation incorrectly states subquery keeps cases "where ... COUNT(*) is **6**" (bolded), despite HAVING `<= 6` and prompt specifying "six or fewer." Misrepresents the filter.
- **Incompleteness**: Neither query uses `SELECT *`, but prompt requires "the full set of events" from a table with "**at least**" the listed columns (implying possible others). Explicitly selecting only three omits unspecified columns, failing "full set."
- **Minor issues**: "DuckDBSQL" (nonstandard term); assumes exact columns; join version claims "often faster" without DuckDB-specific evidence (unnecessary/unclear).
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Alternative window query is syntactically/logically correct for the named columns and achieves exact filtering. Intent matches prompt; provides two approaches with explanation.
- **Overall**: Logic sound but execution critically flawed. Not "nearly flawless"—hypercritical scoring docks heavily for run-breaking errors and imprecisions. Equivalent working query alone might score ~7; syntax + explanation errors drop it.
