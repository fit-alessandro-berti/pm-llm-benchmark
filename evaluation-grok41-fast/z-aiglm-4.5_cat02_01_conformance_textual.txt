**9.8**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (Justifying High Score):**
- **Accuracy**: Perfectly identifies violators (Cases 2, 3, 5) and non-violators (1, 4). All explanations align precisely with normative text:
  - Case 2: Correctly flags "Package items" before "Authorize payment" (direct match to "Authorize payment... before packaging"; key constraint).
  - Case 3: Captures multiple issues (branching contradiction via "Authorize" then "Cancel"; "Ship" post-"Cancel" as "never after cancellation"). Excellent use of "illogical" and "must branch directly."
  - Case 5: Rightly treats "Package items" as mandatory (normative: "should include," "only after... packaged"; constraint implies sequence position requires it). Skipping is a clear deviation.
- **Comprehensiveness**: Covers all cases explicitly. References rules verbatim/contextually. Interprets ambiguities well (e.g., mutually exclusive branches, post-cancel prohibitions).
- **Clarity/Structure**: Flawless organization (per-case sections, sequences, bullet explanations, summary table, ambiguities resolution). Concise yet detailed. No ambiguities in response.
- **Logical Soundness**: No flaws. Implications (e.g., "bypassing critical control," "shipped unprepared") logically derive from text without overreach. Handles "room for interpretation" by sticking to described flows/constraints.

**Minor Deductions (Strict/Hypercritical Only – Preventing 10.0):**
- **Tiny Incompleteness (Case 2)**: Notes primary violation ("Package before Authorize") but doesn't explicitly flag that "Ship order" follows "Package" correctly *yet still violates overall* due to upstream error. Not wrong, but hypercritically, could reinforce "Authorize... before packaging, since payment... is valid and approved" more directly as blocking packaging.
- **Micro-Formatting Nitpick**: Sequences use inconsistent spacing ("Receive order  Check" vs. arrows in headers), mildly reducing visual polish (e.g., Case 1/2/3/4/5 sequences could uniformly arrow for perfection).
- **Slight Overwordiness (Ambiguities)**: Phrases like "mutually exclusive branches" are strong interpretations but add ~1 unnecessary sentence; normative implies it without needing explicit "mutually exclusive" label (minor bloat, not flaw).

**Overall**: Exceptionally strong – 99% flawless. Only microscopic polish issues prevent absolute perfection. Scores 9.0+ only for such quality; this is elite.
