This answer is exemplary: fully accurate, highly detailed, and insightful. It precisely describes the axes, line semantics (including colors, slopes, and overlaps), and extracts all key patterns from the visualization (e.g., immediacy of notifications, variable escalations, batching, and periodic densities). The structure is clear, concise, and directly mirrors the image without errors or omissions.
