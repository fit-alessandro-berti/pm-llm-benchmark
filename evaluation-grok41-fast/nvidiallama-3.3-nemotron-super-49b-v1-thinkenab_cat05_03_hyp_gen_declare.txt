**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies (9.5/10)**: Precisely identifies core contradictions (NonCoexistence(E,C) vs. process/existence needs; RespondedExistence(E|A) creating impossibility with C). Notes undermined logic (bypass E) and redundancy (precedence). Nearly flawless, but misses subtle implication: existence(C)=1.0 + init(R) forces all traces to have R...C, amplifying contradiction if any A occurs (universal impossibility unless no A ever).
- **Hypotheses (8.8/10)**: Covers prompt examples directly (misinterpretation, policy changes, technical errors/data issues). Adds relevant specifics (e.g., claim types, tools). Minor deduction: omits "pressure to handle quickly" explicitly (implied in expedited processing, but not direct match); hypotheses solid but not exhaustive.
- **Verification Approaches (4.8/10)**: Structure/purposes align well; uses all tables (good).  
  - **A**: SQL syntactically ok, detects C without E. *But purpose falsely claims "violating RespondedExistence" (ignores need for A precondition); `last_activity` meaningless (always NULL).* Major imprecision.  
  - **B**: SQL correct/efficient; purpose perfect for testing anomalous NonCoexistence.  
  - **C**: SQL correct, checks exact contradiction (A+C no E), timestamps unused but harmless; excellent.  
  - **D**: *Fundamentally broken*: JOIN filters `ce.activity = 'A'`, so `CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E'` always false  `eval_count=0`, ratio always <0.9, flags everything falsely. No link to E events on assigned claims. Type mismatch risk (`INTEGER adjuster_id = VARCHAR resource`). Purpose good, execution disqualifying.  
  Overall SQL average dragged by A/D errors; 3/4 functional but not "flawless."
- **Overall Structure/Completeness (9.0/10)**: Matches prompt format independently; concise, no leaks. Ignores think tag per instructions.  
- **Strict Adjustments**: -2.8 total for SQL inaccuracies/flaws (D fatal; A misleading); minor misses. High but not "nearly flawless" (8+ requires zero errors).
