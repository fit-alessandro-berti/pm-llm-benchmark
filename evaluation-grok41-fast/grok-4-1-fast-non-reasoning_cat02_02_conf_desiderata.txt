**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This grading is conducted with utmost strictness per instructions: every inaccuracy, unclarity, logical flaw, omission, or imprecision incurs heavy penalties, even if minor or peripheral. The response is structured well and covers ~80% of the task correctly but contains critical failures in accuracy and completeness, disqualifying it from high scores (8+ requires near-flawlessness). Total score reflects deductions from 10.0:

- **Strengths (no deduction):** Perfect structure mirroring task parts. Case 1 fully correct (normative/desiderata). Case 3 normative correct. Desiderata framing clear ("suboptimal but not severe"). Justifications plausible and on-topic.
  
- **Major Deductions (Severe Issues -4.5 points total):**
  - **Missed core normative violation in Case 2 (-2.5):** Fails to identify absence of "Inform Applicant," which is *mandatory* per rules ("must be informed," explicit sequence position after Decision, before branch/Close; no skipping allowed). Log confirms zero occurrence—direct jump Decision  Finalize  Close. Claims only "two clear" violations (Risk before Credit; Finalize after reject)—this is incomplete/factually wrong, undermining Task 1 entirely for the most deviant case. Logical flaw: treats sequence as partially salvageable despite skip.
  - **Incorrect time calculation in Case 3 desiderata (-1.5):** "~75 hours (~3 days)" from Decision (2024-01-14 12:00) to Inform (2024-01-16 15:00) is wrong—precise delta is 51 hours (24h to 15th 12:00 + 24h to 16th 12:00 + 3h = 51h). Inflated by ~24h; misrepresents "exceeding ~48-hour window" scale. Hypercritical: exact math is trivial/required for "timings"; error propagates to "~3 days" hyperbole.

- **Minor Deductions (Accumulate Significantly -1.3 points total):**
  - **Imprecise Case 2 desiderata handling (-0.5):** "No assessment possible... overshadowing" is a logical dodge/evasion. Task requires identifying desiderata failures *across cases* independently ("which cases fail"); normative issues don't negate e.g., absent Inform timing (infinite delay) or missing Follow-up. Also, "Credit Check 40 min after application" wrong—log is 60 min (08:00-09:00).
  - **Minor unclarities/overstatements (-0.5):** Case 2 normative: "sequence irreversibly broken" good but speculative ("later Credit Check might indicate corrective"—unneeded, dilutes strictness). Case 3 normative: abbreviated dates ("01-12") slightly unclear vs. full "2024-01-12." Case 2 justifications: "no valid justification aligns" contradicts own suggestion of "clerical error" (minor inconsistency). Case 3: "spans 01-12 to 01-17" imprecise (actual ~5 days but relevant only for delays).
  - **Omissions (-0.3):** No explicit desiderata note for Case 2 Follow-up absence (even optional). Task 3: No interpretation for Case 2 missing Inform (e.g., "oversight in logging?").

Net: Competent but critically flawed (major misses erode trust in analysis). 4.2 reflects "passing but deficient" under hypercriticism—not 5.0 (too lenient for misses), not 3.0 (structure/content majority sound).
