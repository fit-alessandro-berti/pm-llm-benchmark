**9.8/10.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown):
This response is exceptionally strong—comprehensive, precisely targeted, logically organized, and fully aligned with the prompt's criteria (targeted/open-ended questions uncovering missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, exceptions; no SQL/implementation; conceptual focus). It mirrors the process description's phases while proactively filling gaps (e.g., coordination, metrics as proxies for decision logic). Categorization enhances usability without adding fluff. All 24 questions are open-ended ("What/How/Could you"), relevant, and deepen conceptual understanding without overreaching.

**Strengths (no deductions here):**
- **Coverage**: Exhaustive yet focused—hits every phase (documentation, assignment, inspection/marketing, tenanting, checks) + cross-cutting themes (communication Q17-18, exceptions Q19-21, metrics Q22-24 for success criteria/sequencing insights).
- **Depth**: Probes criteria (Q4-6, Q12), roles (Q1, Q15-16), timing (Q7, Q20), exceptions (Q3, Q8, Q14, Q21), sequencing (Q16), variations (Q2, Q9).
- **No violations**: Purely conceptual; polite intro/wrap-up frames as interviewee dialogue without distracting.
- **Clarity/Logic**: Numbered, grouped logically; no ambiguities, redundancies, or off-topic drifts.

**Minor Flaws (resulting in -0.2 deduction; strict per instructions)**:
- Q23's request for "typical failure rate at each major stage" edges slightly quantitative ("failure rate"), potentially interpretable as metric-hunting rather than purely conceptual (though still valid for bottleneck logic). Hypercritically, this could imply data pulls in a real interview, vs. softer "common points of delay/abandonment."
- Overkill length (24 questions): A "series" implies 10-15 for digestibility; 24 risks interviewee fatigue, minor logical flaw in practicality despite excellence.

Nearly flawless—would be 10.0 absent these microscopic issues. No inaccuracies/unclarities.
