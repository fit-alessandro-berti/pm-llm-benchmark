**8.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Assessment)
This answer is strong overall—correctly identifies compliant cases (1, 4) and violating cases (2, 3, 5), provides accurate per-case sequences, and offers clear, norm-referenced explanations with solid interpretations of ambiguities (e.g., Authorize implying sufficient inventory in Case 3). Structure is logical (case-by-case + summary), references are precise, and violations align with key constraints (e.g., order dependencies, no Ship post-Cancel, required steps).

**Strengths (supporting high score):**
- **Accurate case identification**: All 5 cases correctly classified. Case 1/4 match exact paths; 2/3/5 properly flagged.
- **Per-case explanations**: Flawless.
  - Case 2: Pinpoints Package before Authorize, quotes norm directly ("Package items should only occur after authorization").
  - Case 3: Captures contradictory Cancel post-Authorize (excellent inference: "implying sufficient stock then canceled"), plus Ship post-Cancel.
  - Case 5: Correctly flags skipped Package and direct Ship post-Authorize.
- Covers implied requirements (e.g., no fulfillment post-Cancel, sequencing logic).
- Concise, readable formatting.

**Flaws (deducting from 10.0; hypercritical deductions):**
- **Clear inaccuracy in summary (major logical flaw, -1.0)**: Bullet "- Packaging must precede shipping (breached in cases 2 and 5)." 
  - Case 2 **does not** breach this: Package (10:00) precedes Ship (11:00). Breach in Case 2 is Authorize-Package order (already covered correctly elsewhere), not packaging-to-shipping precedence.
  - Misattributes a rule breach, undermining summary precision. This is not interpretive ambiguity—it's factually wrong per timestamps/logic.
- **Minor unclarities/redundancies (-0.5)**: 
  - Case 2 explanation adds interpretive flourish ("warehouse prepared goods without knowing payment was approved")—accurate but slightly speculative vs. sticking to norm text.
  - Case 3 misses explicit note on missing Package before Ship (minor, as Ship-post-Cancel dominates, but norm requires it post-Authorize).
  - Unnecessary dates (e.g., "(2023-10-06)") add no value.
- **No mention of universal goods (e.g., all start Receive  Check; Close final)**: Implicitly handled but not reinforcing compliance explicitly—tiny gap.

**Score Justification**: 9.5+ requires **nearly flawless** (zero inaccuracies). Case-by-case is 10/10; summary error is a targeted logical inaccuracy (not holistic failure), so 8.5 reflects excellence with strict penalty. Lower (e.g., 7.0) would overpunish given core task (ID + explain violations) is nailed.
