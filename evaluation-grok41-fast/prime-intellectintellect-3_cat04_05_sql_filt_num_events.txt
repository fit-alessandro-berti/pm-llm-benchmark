**10.0**

The final query is precisely correct, standard SQL fully compatible with DuckDB, efficiently identifies qualifying `case_id`s via grouping and `HAVING`, and returns exactly the full set of original events (`SELECT *`) from cases with 6 events total, with no extra columns or data leakage. All explanations accurately describe the mechanics, NULL handling (correct GROUP BY behavior), and correctness. The minor phrasing slip ("cases with 6 events" instead of "six or fewer") in one sentence is a trivial shorthand/typo amid repeated correct statements of `<= 6` and the task restatement, not altering logic or introducing inaccuracy in conclusions. Alternative CTE is valid and equivalent. No flaws in grouping, filtering, efficiency notes, or output.
