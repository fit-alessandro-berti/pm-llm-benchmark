The final boxed output is an exact copy of the input DECLARE model with no analysis, discussion of real-life scenarios, explanations of constraints, compliance, quality standards, sequencing, interplay of rules, or speculation on business/regulatory goals. It addresses none of the open-ended question's requirements, rendering it non-responsive and logically void.
