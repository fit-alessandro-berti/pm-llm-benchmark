**8.0**

### Explanation of Grade (for transparency, not part of response):
- **Strengths (near-flawless aspects)**: Correctly identifies all intra-case duplicates ("Verify Documents" in C001/C003; "Call Customer" in C002). Renames are precise, contextually accurate, and disambiguate effectively (e.g., "Verify Original Documents" vs. "Verify Submitted ID Scan" perfectly captures pre/post-submission in C001; similar for others). Revised log preserves all original data (timestamps, resources, contexts) except renamed activities. Justification is brief, structured, and directly ties names to contextual clues (position, descriptions). Non-duplicate activities (e.g., C002 "Verify Documents", single "Call Customer" instances) correctly unchanged. Process roles highlighted well.
- **Flaws (strict deductions)**: Critical inaccuracy in C003 table—rows not in chronological order ("Verify Adjusted Account Documents" at 12:20 listed before "Adjust Account" at 12:05). This misrepresents the process flow, undermines disambiguation (second verify logically depends on prior adjust), and violates event log integrity. No other changes needed, but this is not minor (significant logical/presentation flaw). Names slightly verbose but clear. Deducted 2.0 points for this; otherwise 10.0.
