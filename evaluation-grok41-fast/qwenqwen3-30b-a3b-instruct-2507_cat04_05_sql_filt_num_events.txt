**10.0**

The provided SQL query is logically flawless, semantically correct, and precisely achieves the stated objective. It correctly:
- Groups events by `case_id` in the subquery.
- Filters to only `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` using `HAVING`.
- Returns the full set of events (`e.*`, preserving all columns including `activity` and `timestamp`) for exactly those qualifying cases via `IN`.
- Avoids any unnecessary filtering, sorting, or computation on the main result set.
- Uses standard SQL compatible with DuckDB, with no syntax errors, inefficiencies, or ambiguities.

No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, performance issues, or deviations from requirements—even minor ones. This is a model implementation.
