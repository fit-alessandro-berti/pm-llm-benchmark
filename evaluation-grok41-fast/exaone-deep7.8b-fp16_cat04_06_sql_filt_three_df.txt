**8.0**

The solution demonstrates correct logical understanding of the requirements: it accurately identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence using row numbers and joins (ensuring no intervening events via `rn + 1` and `rn + 2`), applies the >5 days filter specifically between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' timestamps in those trios, collects such `case_id`s via `DISTINCT`, and excludes all events from them. The CTE structure is efficient and appropriate for DuckDB. The explanation is clear and matches the intent.

However, the query contains a critical syntax error in the final `WHERE` clause: `WHERE NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)` is invalid SQL—it omits `case_id` before `NOT IN`, causing the query to fail parsing/execution. This is not a minor typo (e.g., spacing or alias); it renders the provided code non-functional. Under hypercritical evaluation, this alone prevents a "nearly flawless" score, warranting a significant deduction despite flawless logic elsewhere. Equivalent fixes (e.g., `WHERE case_id NOT IN ...` or `WHERE NOT EXISTS (...)`) would elevate it to 10.0. No other inaccuracies, but no leniency for runtime-breaking issues.
