**7.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Assessment)
This answer is well-structured, comprehensive, and directly addresses all three tasks with clear tables, logical progression, and actionable mitigations. It correctly identifies the slow cases (2002, 2003, 2005), strongly correlates delays to complexity and document requests (the key insight), appropriately downplays region as a weaker factor, and ties resources to handling complex cases without overclaiming causation. Mitigations are practical, targeted, and explained with impact. Qualitatively, it's strong—nearly publication-ready for a process mining report.

However, **multiple factual inaccuracies in core time calculations** (central to the task of analyzing "longer lead times") prevent a higher score. These are not minor rounding issues but verifiable errors that undermine the quantitative rigor and could mislead readers on delay magnitudes:

- **2002 total duration**: Listed as "26:55" (27.0h), but precise calculation is 25:55 (from 04-01 09:05 to 04-02 11:00 = 1,555 minutes 25.92h). Off by ~1h.
- **2002 last-request-to-approval wait**: "17.5 hours" (14:00 on 04-01 to 10:00 on 04-02), but actually 20 hours exactly (14:00–24:00 = 10h; 00:00–10:00 = 10h). Off by 2.5h.
- **2005 last-request-to-approval wait**: "41 hours" (15:00 on 04-03 to 10:00 on 04-04), but actually 19 hours (15:00–24:00 = 9h; 00:00–10:00 = 10h). Off by 22h—a glaring, doubling-level error that distorts the "primary driver" claim.

These flaws appear in the key evidence tables (Sections 1 and 2B), making the analysis less credible despite correct totals elsewhere (e.g., 2003, 2005 overall durations). No unclarities or major logical flaws (e.g., causation is cautiously attributed), but the strict policy demands significant deductions for "any inaccuracies" (here, three material ones). A flawless answer would have pixel-perfect timestamps verified in all claims. Minor positives (e.g., 27h for 2002 is directionally fine) don't offset this.

**Score breakdown**: 10 base for structure/insights; -0.8 for each calc error (-2.4 total); -0.4 for inconsistent precision across tables. Rounded to 7.2.
