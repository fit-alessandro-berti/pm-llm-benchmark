**10.0**

The final output is flawless. It fully meets all requirements with precise data integration, correct event derivation (one per logical unit: per order line for picks, per delivery for dispatch/arrive, per invoice/payment), exact timestamps, logical resources from tables, relevant other attributes in dedicated columns (blank when inapplicable), global chronological sorting verified accurate, all order_ids covered including incomplete 1004, and assumptions documented via note. No inaccuracies, omissions, or flaws.
