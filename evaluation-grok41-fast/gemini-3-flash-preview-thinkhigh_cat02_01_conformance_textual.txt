**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless: it correctly identifies exactly the deviant cases (2, 3, 5), provides precise sequences with violations clearly highlighted, offers accurate explanations tightly referencing the normative description (e.g., direct quotes on packaging after authorization, shipping only after packaging/never after cancellation), logically interprets implications (e.g., "directly proceed" to cancel precludes intervening fulfillment steps like Authorize; mixing paths as inconsistent), notes all key violations without omission or invention (e.g., Case 3's multiple issues including path mixing and missing packaging; Case 5's explicit skip), distinguishes valid cases (1 and 4) for completeness, and maintains crystal-clear structure with no ambiguities, logical flaws, or extraneous content. Hypercritical review confirms zero inaccuracies, even minor.
