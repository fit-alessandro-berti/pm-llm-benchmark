**1.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Major Flaw 1: Fails to enforce order of the sequence (Approve  Create  Confirm)**. No `e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp` condition. The query matches cases where 'Create Order' precedes 'Approve Purchase Requisition', wrongly identifying invalid sequences (e.g., Create at t1, Approve at t2, Confirm at t3 with t3-t1 > 5 days).
- **Major Flaw 2: Completely ignores "direct succession" / "no other event in between"**. Self-joins find *any* later Confirm after *any* Create (after any Approve), ignoring intermediates. Example: Approve (t1), Intermediate (t2), Create (t3), Confirm (t4 > t3+5 days) falsely matches.
- **Major Flaw 3: Incorrect time measurement**. `HAVING MIN(e3.timestamp) - MAX(e2.timestamp) > interval '5 days'` uses aggregates across *all* matching triples per case, not the specific Create-Confirm pair "of that sequence". This falsely triggers on unrelated pairs (e.g., early Create + late Confirm elsewhere) or fails to trigger on valid long pairs if aggregates dilute (e.g., one short pair pulls MIN(e3) early or MAX(e2) late).
- **Major Flaw 4: Faulty join logic**. `e2.activity = 'Create Order'` is in the *e3* join condition, causing cartesian-like explosion before filtering. `e1.activity` in *e2* join redundantly filters but doesn't sequentialize. Redundant `e1.case_id = e3.case_id`.
- **Minor Flaws**: No ties/duplicate timestamp handling (assumes strict order). `GROUP BY` unnecessary for existence but mangles per-sequence logic. Works in DuckDB syntax but irrelevant due to logic failures.
- **Partial Credit Denied**: Structure (CTE exclusion, final SELECT/ORDER BY) superficially matches output form but computes wrong `target_cases`, yielding incorrect results. No attempt at consecutiveness (e.g., no `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LAG()`, or gap checks). Utterly flawed for core requirements. Equivalent to broken code.
