**4.0**

### Hypercritical Breakdown (for transparency, not part of grade):
- **Strengths (limited)**: Correctly identifies recurring activities (Verify Documents, Call Customer) and their positional/contextual shifts (initial vs. re-verification; info-request vs. confirmation). Justification is mostly logical, brief, and ties to clues like "verification incomplete," "clarify discrepancy," and post-adjustment rechecks.
- **Major Flaws (severely penalizing)**:
  - **Incomplete revised log (critical failure on Task 3)**: Original log has ~6 rows per case in full tables for C001/C002/C003. Answer provides only a broken partial table for C001, a sloppy abbreviated text block for C001 only, and "(Repeat analogous substitutions...)" — no actual full revised log for C002/C003. This is not "present[ing] a revised version of the event log"; it's a sketch.
  - **Formatting butchery**: Markdown tables broken (missing pipes, inconsistent bolding, non-standard hyphens like , truncated/mutated timestamps e.g., "10:{10}00", "09:{45}0", "2024-05-01T09:15" vs. original "2024-05-01 09:15:00"). Additional Context altered/ shortened (e.g., "Verification incomplete  agent calls" adds arrows; "<same>" placeholders). Destroys usability.
- **Inaccuracies/Unclarities (significant deductions)**:
  - Renaming inconsistent/overly specific: `OutboundContact-MissingDocs` fits C001 but not C002 ("clarify account discrepancy") or C003 ("calls to have them return" after step-out — neither "missing docs" nor discrepancy). Justification claims it "always follows incomplete verification or seeks clarification" but labels it too narrowly, failing disambiguation across cases.
  - No handling of case-specific nuances (e.g., C003's branch/physical vs. web; doesn't rename Initiate Request variant for "Walk-in at branch").
  - Ignores Task 1 fully: Doesn't explicitly list/interpret *all* recurrences per case upfront in final output.
- **Minor but compounding issues**: Unchanged activities justified correctly, but overall output verbose/messy (e.g., "> *Note:*", dashed lines). Alters non-Activity columns subtly, against implication to revise only activities.
- **Why not lower?** Core analysis in justification is sound enough to avoid 1-3; shows understanding. Why not higher? Far from "nearly flawless" — incomplete/illegible log alone tanks it below 5.
