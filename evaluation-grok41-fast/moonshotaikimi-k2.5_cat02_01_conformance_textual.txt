The answer is flawless in its final conclusions and explanations. It correctly identifies exactly the violating cases (2, 3, 5) with no omissions or false positives. All explanations are precise, directly reference relevant textual quotes without distortion, logically interpret constraints (e.g., mandatory sequencing/prerequisites, no post-cancellation fulfillment), and resolve ambiguities conservatively per the description (e.g., focusing on explicit rules like "never after cancellation" and "only after packaging" rather than speculating on unmentioned scenarios like post-authorization cancellation causes). Structure is clear, comprehensive (covers conformance too), and free of inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws—even minor phrasing is exact and professional.
