**10.0**

The provided answer is exemplary: fully accurate in identifying deviating cases (2, 3, 5) while correctly clearing 1 and 4; explanations are precise, directly referencing the normative description's constraints (e.g., order dependencies, branching logic, prohibitions on fulfillment post-cancellation, mandatory sequences); interpretations resolve ambiguities logically without overreach (e.g., Case 3's illogical Authorize-then-Cancel as violating sufficiency-based branching; Case 5's missing Package as breaching explicit pre-Ship requirement); no inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, omissions, or extraneous content; structure enhances readability with per-case breakdowns and concise summary. Minor cosmetic issues (e.g., arrow encoding) are irrelevant to substance.
