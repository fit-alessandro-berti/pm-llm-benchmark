**1.0**

This "answer" provides zero final statements, conclusions, or case groupings—only an incomplete, truncated chain-of-thought that stops midway through data extraction (at event 4, omitting 14 other events entirely). It fails to address the core task of inferring and outputting case groupings (e.g., explicitly listing which events belong to which inferred cases, such as Case 1: events 1,4,7,12,15 for 45M; Case 2: 2,5,8,10,11,14,17 for 62F; Case 3: 3,6,9,13,16,18 for 28M). No logical analysis, no output format, no resolution—purely unfinished and non-responsive. Under hypercritical evaluation, this is a complete non-answer warranting the minimum score.
