**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. Both SQL queries (CTE and IN subquery) precisely implement the required logic: they correctly group by `case_id`, apply `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to retain only cases with 6 events (accurately excluding >6 as specified), and return the full set of events (`SELECT e.*`) for qualifying cases without altering or losing any rows from those cases. 

- **Accuracy**: No logical flaws; both queries produce identical, correct results matching the spec. Handles grouping/filtering perfectly; no over/under-filtering.
- **Clarity**: Well-structured code with precise comments; explanation explicitly maps to requirements (steps 1-2); alternative provided enhances utility without redundancy.
- **Completeness**: Addresses all aspects (e.g., full events via join/subquery); no assumptions beyond given schema; DuckDB-compatible (standard SQL).
- **Efficiency/Style**: Both versions are efficient (subquery/CTE avoid unnecessary computation); clean, readable, no unused columns impacting output.

No inaccuracies, unclarities, syntax issues, or edge cases mishandled (e.g., empty table, single-event cases, exactly 6 events). Exceeds minimum by providing options/explanation without bloat.
