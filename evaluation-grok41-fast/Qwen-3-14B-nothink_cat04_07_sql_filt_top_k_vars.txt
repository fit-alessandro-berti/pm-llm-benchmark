**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
This answer is **nearly flawless** in logic, structure, and fulfillment of requirements, warranting a very high score. It correctly:
- Extracts ordered sequences per `case_id` using `STRING_AGG` with `ORDER BY timestamp` (DuckDB-supported, precise).
- Groups/counts variants accurately.
- Ranks and selects top K via CTEs.
- Filters cases belonging to top K variants.
- Joins back to `event_log` to return **all events** (`e.*`) only from those cases, excluding others perfectly.
- Includes helpful step-by-step breakdown and notes.

**Minor deductions (-0.8 total)**:
- `LIMIT K` is a literal placeholder, rendering the query **syntactically invalid** in DuckDB (errors: "no such variable K"). Notes acknowledge "replace K", but the "Final Query" as copy-pasted fails execution—strictly an inaccuracy (deduct -0.5). Benchmarks expect either parameterization (e.g., `LIMIT ?`) or numeric assumption (e.g., 10).
- Unnecessary final `ORDER BY e.timestamp` (global order across cases; prompt requires no specific ordering, risking non-deterministic interleaving if timestamps overlap cases—minor unclarity, deduct -0.2).
- String delimiter `' -> '` risks theoretical collision if activities contain it (negligible in practice, but hypercritically imprecise vs. `LIST_AGG` for exact sequences, deduct -0.1).

No logical flaws, unclarities in core logic, or misses. Fixes are trivial; core solution is production-ready. Higher than 9.2 would ignore strict syntax enforcement.
