**9.7**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (near-flawless aspects)**:
  - **Core Output Matches Task Perfectly**: Delivers a valid Python dictionary with correct structure: keys as tuples like `('SS', 'OP')`, values as `(avg, std)` tuples in seconds. Includes 9 immediate pairs + 7 non-adjacent pairs (e.g., `('SS', 'QI')` spans 3 steps, `('QI', 'WS')` spans 4, `('SS', 'AS')` spans 9), ensuring "representative subset" with "complexity by considering pairs separated by multiple steps." All pairs respect logical order (no invalid successors).
  - **Plausible, Process-Aware Estimates**: Averages reflect supply chain realities (e.g., logistics like `('OP', 'RC')`: 86400s/1 day; quick decisions like `('SS', 'OP')`: 3600s/1h; cumulative for spans like `('SS', 'AS')`: 241200s/~2.8 days total process). Std devs reasonable (e.g., lower relative variability for logistics).
  - **Mathematical Consistency**: Non-adjacent pairs correctly computed as sum of means and (sum of variances) assuming independence—matches temporal profile definition. Calculations accurate (e.g., `('SS', 'QI')`: 97200, 5400 exactly; approximations like 4025 for 16200000=4024.94 rounded sensibly, no major errors).
  - **Matches Example Style**: Uses seconds, similar magnitudes to sample `{('A', 'B'): (86400, 3600)}`.
  - **Clarity & Polish**: Explicit final dict; comments explain methodology without altering output. No syntax errors; runnable Python.

- **Minor Deductions (strict/hypercritical flaws, preventing 10.0)**:
  - **Rounding Inconsistencies**: Some std devs rounded (e.g., 64800000=8049.848050 ok; 275400000=16599.416600 ok; 317400000=17816.617800 slightly off by ~16s or 0.09%; 320760000=1791017900 off by ~10s). While negligible (~0.1% error), strictness demands exact integers or floats (e.g., 17817, 17910) without silent approximation—minor logical flaw in precision.
  - **Presentation Verbosity**: Initial "variable/formula" dict uses undefined vars (quick_mean etc.) and round(), not a standalone executable dict (requires evaluation). Only the final explicit dict is pure, but dual presentation introduces redundancy/clarity risk. Comments have minor typos (e.g., “square–root–of–sum–of–variances”, “manufacturingrelated”).
  - **Subset Scope**: 16 pairs is representative but borders exhaustive (could trim redundant spans like `('SS', 'RC')` and `('SS', 'QI')` both early-process); prompt wants "subset", not near-complete chain.
  - **No Edge Cases**: Lacks variety like mid-chain skips (e.g., `('CA', 'DT')`) or highly variable pairs, but still complex enough—no penalty as "representative."

Overall: Exceptionally strong (flawless core logic/output, thoughtful design), but tiny precision/presentation nits drop from 10.0. Equivalent to A++ with microscopic polish needed.
