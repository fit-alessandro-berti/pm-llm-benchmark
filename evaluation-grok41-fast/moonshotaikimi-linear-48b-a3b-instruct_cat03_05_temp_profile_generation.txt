**7.2**

### Strengths (supporting the score):
- **Correct format and structure**: Valid Python dictionary with tuple keys `(earlier_activity, later_activity)` and values as `(avg_time_seconds, stdev_seconds)`. Includes realistic second-based units (e.g., 86400s = 1 day).
- **Representative subset with complexity**: Covers all 9 direct consecutive pairs (SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS) plus 6 indirect pairs separated by multiple steps (e.g., SSRC spans 1 step; QIPK spans 3; RCDT spans 6). Total 15/45 possible pairs in linear sequence—appropriately "representative" without exhaustiveness.
- **Reasonable individual estimates**: Times scale logically by phase (hours for internal ops like SSOP/RCQI; days for procurement/assembly like OPRC/QICA; weeks for distribution/AS). Stdevs ~50% of avg reflect high supply chain variability (e.g., supplier delays). Comments and summary provide clear rationale tied to process phases.
- **Valid pairs only**: All respect linear order (no reverses or skips violating "eventually follow each other").

### Critical Flaws (deducting points harshly per instructions):
- **Major logical inconsistency in indirect times**: Averages must approximately sum additively along the path in a linear process (as per temporal profile definition from traces). Examples:
  | Indirect Pair | Assigned Avg (hours) | Path Sum of Direct Avgs (hours) | % Error |
  |---------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|---------|
  | OPPK        | 72                  | 48 (OP-RC) +4+24+72+20 = **168** | -57%   |
  | CADT        | 120                 | 72 (CA-PT) +20+10+120 = **222**  | -46%   |
  | SSPT        | 96                  | 8+48+4+24+72 = **156**           | -38%   |
  | RCDT        | 144                 | 4+24+72+20+10+120 = **250**      | -42%   |
  | QIPK        | 96                  | 24+72+20 = **116**               | -17%   |
  *(SSRC matches perfectly at 56h, minor win.)*
  
  This violates the model's intent (computed from real trace intervals); indirects systematically underestimate, undermining realism/credibility. No justification for divergences (e.g., "parallelism" impossible in described linear process).
- **Minor estimation implausibilities**: OPRC at 48h (2 days) too short for "global supply chain" high-tech components (typically 1-4 weeks); WSDT at 120h (5 days) arbitrary without multi-step justification.
- **Incomplete coverage**: No end-to-end pairs (e.g., SSDT, SSAS, OPDT) despite "complexity" emphasis; skips some mid-chain (e.g., PTDT, RCPK).
- **Extra prose**: Helpful but slightly verbose/unnecessary ("This temporal profile captures..." reads promotional, not concise).

Nearly flawless would require additive consistency (±10-20% variance allowance), fuller indirects, and tighter supply-chain realism. Solid effort (mid-high score) but flaws are logically glaring under hypercritical lens.
