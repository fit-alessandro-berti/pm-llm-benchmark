**9.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
**Strengths (justifying high base score):**
- **Structure and Completeness**: Perfectly mirrors the task's 1-2-3 structure. All cases analyzed for normative (hard) rules with clear explanations, violations precisely tied to log evidence (e.g., Case 2's Risk before Credit, missing Inform, prohibited Finalize). Desiderata correctly treated as "soft" with explicit clarification of suboptimality (e.g., "Minor issues only", "soft deviations"). Part 3 provides plausible, constraint-aligned justifications for *all* cases, including violations (e.g., "clerical error" for Case 2 Finalize), plus bonus operational insight.
- **Accuracy on Normative**: Flawless. Case 1/3 compliant (correct sequence, conditional Finalize logic). Case 2 violations exhaustive and correctly prioritized (ordering, missing mandatory Inform—"must be informed" per rules—prohibited Finalize). No misses like overlooking Inform's universality (post-Decision for all outcomes).
- **Accuracy on Desiderata**: Timings precisely calculated (e.g., Case 3's 49h/51h). Follow-up correctly flagged as universal miss. Clarifies non-severity well.
- **Part 3**: Creative yet grounded interpretations (e.g., unlogged batch for Case 2 Inform justifies without excusing violation).

**Flaws Deducting from 10.0 (hypercritical deductions, each significant per instructions):**
- **-0.3: Incomplete Desiderata Assessment for Case 2**: States "Timing not assessed because the case is already non-compliant." Logical flaw—desiderata are *independent* of normative (task treats as separate identification). Should explicitly check: Credit ~1h (meets 24h), Inform absent (timing N/A), Follow-up miss. Summary luckily infers timings met ("only the missing Follow-up"), but evasion creates unclarity/logical gap. Minor but "significantly lower" per rubric.
- **-0.3: Minor Unclarities/Formatting Issues**: Bullet phrasing awkward/incomplete (e.g., Case 1/2: "Not present desideratum missed."—missing punctuation, reads as fragment). Part 2 Case 1 says "Minor issues only" then lists *one* issue (Follow-up); implies timings perfect but could explicitly say "Timings fully met" for precision. Hypercritical: even cosmetic flaws count.
- **-0.2: Slight Overreach in Part 3 Case 2 Justifications**: "Data-entry mistake" or "template opened automatically" for violations is interpretive but borders speculative without log evidence; task wants "in line with constraints" (ok for desiderata, stretched for hard violations). "Illegal state" phrasing in Part 1 good, but here risks implying violations were "non-violations" via error. Subtle logical tension.

**Overall**: Near-flawless (exceptional detail, no major errors), but three minor issues (incompleteness, clarity, overreach) mandate deduction to 9.2. A 10 requires *zero* flaws.
