**9.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**: The answer comprehensively follows all instructions: groups all 15 events into logical phases (1-3, 4-6, 7-8, 9, 10, 11-12, 13-15), assigns intuitive labels matching prompt examples (e.g., Cutting, Assembling, Welding, Quality Inspection), provides a clear summary table and detailed rationales tied to specific sensor patterns (e.g., vibration spikes for cutting/welding, pressure for assembly). Progressions are coherent (idle  cut  assemble  weld  cool  inspect  idle), and explanations are evidence-based (e.g., temp/energy spikes for welding). Covers transitions and full cycle effectively.
  
- **Weaknesses/Flaws (deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Inaccuracy in Event 10 rationale (moderate deduction, -0.5)**: Labeled "Cool Down / Reset" in table and detailed analysis claims "tool to retract," but tool position remains at 15mm (no reset/retraction occurs here—retraction to 20mm happens in 11, full home reset in 13). This introduces a factual error in sensor interpretation, undermining precision.
  - **Minor label inconsistencies/unclarities (-0.3)**: "Standby / Idling" (1-3) vs. "Standby / Cycle End" (13-15)—same pattern but differentiated without strong justification (readings are nearly identical). "Part Assembly / Pressing" (table) vs. "Assembling / Joining" (detailed)—slight drift. "Quality Inspection / Offloading" speculatively merges two activities without clear sensor distinction (low flow/vib could be either, but not decisively both).
  - **Typos/formatting nitpicks (-0.2)**: "5mm  7mm  10mm" (extra spaces in cutting rationale). Bolded table headers are inconsistent with plain text.
  - **Speculative overreach (minor, -0.0 additional as balanced by evidence)**: "Coolant" for material flow in cutting (plausible but unproven; label is "Material Flow"). Welding vib at 50Hz (higher than cutting's 38Hz) fits spike but stretches typical welding patterns slightly.

Overall: Nearly flawless structure/content (95%+ alignment), but minor logical inaccuracy (tool reset) and unclarities prevent 10.0. Equivalent to A- under hypercritical lens—excellent but not impeccable.
