**3.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation:
- **Major Inaccuracies in Loop Modeling (Severe Flaw, -4 points)**: 
  - `loop_IQC_AS = LOOP(IQC, AS)` always starts with IQC (minimal trace: IQC), but all traces start assembly with AS after QS (e.g., cases 1-5: QS  AS; case 4: QS  AS  TST, **no IQC**). Cannot replay case 4 or any trace without forcing extraneous IQC. LOOP semantics (A then optional (B  A)*) produces IQC AS IQC AS..., mismatching log's AS IQC AS... patterns. Case 3's IQC IQC (double IQC) impossible. Explanation claims "repetition of IQC and AS", but code/loop order contradicts log and even its own description.
  - `loop_RT_TST = LOOP(RT, TST)` always starts with RT (minimal: RT), but testing always starts with TST (e.g., case 2: TST  PK; case 4: TST  PK). Produces RT TST RT..., impossible in log (TST RT TST...). Cannot replay non-rework cases (2,4) or rework (1,3,5). Proper modeling needs TST  optional LOOP(RT, TST), but absent.

- **Structural Omissions and Forced Mandatories (-2 points)**: No standalone AS; entire assembly/testing forced through flawed mandatory loops (QS  loop_IQC_AS  loop_RT_TST). Case 4 (QS  AS  TST) impossible (would require IQC  RT minimally). No modeling of interleaved/multiple AS/IQC flexibility beyond simplistic (flawed) loop.

- **Minor Positives (+1 point total)**: Optional LB correctly as `XOR(LB, skip)` after PK (matches case 2 skip, sequencing in others). Sequential partial order chain mostly aligns with backbone (ORMSQS...PK...D). Uses correct POWL classes/operators/syntax. Silent skip appropriate.

- **Unclarities/Logical Flaws (-1 point)**: Explanation claims "captures observed behavior" (false; see above). Notes "no explicit concurrency" but log timestamps imply full sequencing (correctly chained, no issue). "PK always precedes LB" accurate but concurrency comment irrelevant/misleading. Inconsistent loop descriptions vs. code (e.g., IQC-AS order).

Overall: Ambitious structure with correct POWL usage, but core process (assembly/IQC/testing loops/optionals) fundamentally misrepresents log traces—cannot generate valid sequences for cases 2/4, distorts 1/3/5. Not "representing this complex process"; partial skeleton only. Far from flawless.
