**9.7**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—comprehensive, structured, accurate, and directly responsive to the question—but deducts a minor 0.3 for two small issues under utmost strictness: (1) slight overgeneralization in Step 3 bias description (claims "long-standing residents... receive [adjustment]" but process specifies adjustment for *local address* or *voluntary club listing*, with "long-standing" only as an example correlation; this introduces a tiny inaccuracy in "how" bias is introduced), and (2) use of "disparate impact" term in Manual Review without qualifying its limited legal applicability (since traits aren't protected classes), risking minor logical overreach in a fairness-focused discussion. No other inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws: identifies exact stages/mechanisms precisely; balances justifiability (risk/business rationale) vs. problematic nature (equity/transparency); thoroughly covers implications for non-protected groups; logical flow impeccable; recommendations enhance without detracting. Nearly flawless, warranting very high score.
