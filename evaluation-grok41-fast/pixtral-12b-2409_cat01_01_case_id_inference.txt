**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Major Inaccuracies in Event Assignments (Severe Deduction: -4.0)**: Critical logical flaws in grouping. Event 14 (Prescription for 62F infection by Dr. Smith ER) wrongly assigned to Case 3 (28M Surgery)—mismatches patient demographics, doctor, department, diagnosis context, and timing (follows 62F's event 11 directly). Event 16 (Recovery room 28M post-surgery) wrongly assigned to Case 1 (45M ER, labeled as "17" with 28M details)—logical impossibility, as 45M has no surgery/recovery and is discharged earlier at event 15. Case 2 (62F) completely misses event 14 (essential prescription step) and mislabels event 17 (62F discharge) as "16." Case 3 misses event 16. These are not minor; they break case integrity, logical flows, and attribute matching.
- **Numbering and Listing Inconsistencies (Severe Deduction: -1.5)**: Initial summaries list wrong event numbers (e.g., Case 1 claims event 17, a 62F ER discharge; Case 2 claims event 16, actually 28M recovery). Detailed sections copy-paste wrong timestamps/details (e.g., Case 1 "17" has 08:31:37 recovery text; Case 2 "16" has 08:35:29 62F discharge). Creates confusion and unreliability—cannot trust the output.
- **Incomplete Coverage and Logical Flaws (Major Deduction: -1.0)**: All events "assigned" but via swaps/duplication errors; Case 2 lacks prescription (breaks ER infection journey). Case 1 claims "Surgery" department despite no matching events (X-ray is Radiology, not Surgery). Ignores timestamps/activity sequences (e.g., 28M recovery at 08:31:37 fits post-13 surgery, not 45M's ER discharge at 08:30).
- **Minor Positives (Partial Credit: +3.0 base)**: Correctly identifies 3 cases by unique patient_age/gender combos (45M, 62F, 28M). Most events (~12/18) correctly grouped by demographics/timing. Structure (summaries + details) is clear.
- **Unclarities/Overconfidence (Minor Deduction: -0.3)**: No acknowledgment of ambiguities or reasoning for assignments (e.g., why include mismatches?). Assumes departments loosely without justifying cross-dept logic.

**Overall**: Fundamentally flawed groupings undermine the core task. Equivalent to ~70% correct events but with cascading errors making it unreliable. Not "nearly flawless"—strictly mid-low score.
