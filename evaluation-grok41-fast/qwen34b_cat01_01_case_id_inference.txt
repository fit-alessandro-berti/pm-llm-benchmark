10.0

The final grouping is completely accurate, exhaustive (covers all 18 events without overlap or omission), logically sound, and precisely matches patient attributes (age, gender), departments, activity sequences, and timestamps across cases. Each case forms a coherent patient journey: Case 1 (ER fracture pathway), Case 2 (ER infection/lab pathway), Case 3 (Surgery procedure pathway). Notes and summary are clear, precise, and free of any errors, ambiguities, or flaws.
