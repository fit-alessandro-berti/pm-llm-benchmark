The provided answer is exemplary and fully meets all requirements with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. The final dictionary is precisely formatted as a valid Python structure with correct tuple keys (ordered pairs where the first activity precedes the second) and tuple values (positive integer average times and standard deviations in seconds). It includes a representative subset of 14 pairs: all 9 consecutive pairs in the implied linear sequence (SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS) plus 5 non-consecutive multi-step pairs (e.g., ('SS','RC') spanning 2 steps, ('SS','AS') spanning 9 steps), ensuring the required complexity. Estimates are domain-realistic (e.g., supplier lead times ~14 days, assembly ~3 days, cumulative end-to-end ~59 days with growing variability), derived consistently via summation of averages and (variances) for non-consecutive pairs (verified spot-checks confirm numerical accuracy, e.g., ('SS','RC') avg=1,382,400s, std=273,221s  (86,400² + 259,200²)). Inline comments and post-dictionary explanations enhance clarity without detracting. No extraneous content, assumptions (linear traces), or errors; it is production-ready and directly usable for ZETA-based deviation detection.
