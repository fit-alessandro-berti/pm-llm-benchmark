**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**:
  - **Completeness**: All events from both logs are included; no omissions. Non-matching events (Quality Check, Item Delivered, Payment Processed/PaymentCheck) are preserved as-is with origin indicated via "Source Systems" column.
  - **Merging Logic**: Semantic matching (e.g., "Order Received"  "OrderReceived"; "Item Shipped"  "Shipping") is appropriate and documented. Attributes are fully enriched (e.g., user_id, resource_id, notes from B integrated into merged rows).
  - **Chronological Order**: Correctly sorted using chosen primary timestamps (A for merged/only-A; B for only-B). Order reflects realistic sequence without distortion.
  - **Timestamp Handling**: Prioritizes Log A as "primary timeline" for merged events (e.g., 10:00:00Z over 09:59:58Z), per requirements. No both-timestamps clutter; selection is explicit and reasoned.
  - **Output Format**: Clean, professional table with enriched schema (adds User ID, Resource ID, Notes, Sources). Readable and directly usable as "single, integrated event log".
  - **Reasoning**: Comprehensive, event-by-event, transparent (e.g., admits 2s edge cases). Covers matching criteria (order_id + timing + semantics), conflicts (timestamps/names), and decisions. Logical separation of Payment events due to 5s gap + "delay" note.
  - **No Extraneous Issues**: No invention of data; no unsafe merges; handles missing attributes consistently ("-").

- **Flaws/Deductions (Strict/Hypercritical)**:
  - **Tolerance Inconsistency (-0.5)**: Prompt specifies "less than 2 seconds" (e.g., example). Answer merges *exactly* 2s diffs (Order Received: 2s; Item Shipped: 2s) despite explicitly noting "less than" in strategy. Override relies on semantics ("names identical"), but this bends the heuristic without prompt support, introducing minor subjectivity. Confident? Yes, but not "strict" adherence.
  - **Event Name Standardization Minor Inconsistency (-0.2)**: For merged events, prefers A's names (good), but PaymentCheck kept as B's raw "PaymentCheck" (separate, so fine). However, table mixes conventions without a unified "standardized" column, slightly reducing clarity (e.g., "Payment Processed" vs. "PaymentCheck" could note semantic link in Notes).
  - **Timestamp Absorption Clarity (-0.1)**: For merged events, B's timestamps aren't explicitly "included both" (e.g., no "ts_a: ..., ts_b: ..." field). Prompt allows "select one ... or include both"; selection is fine, but zero visibility of discarded B ts (e.g., 09:59:58Z lost) is a tiny gap in "include all attributes".
  - **Payment Separation Overly Cautious? (No deduction, but noted)**: 5s >2s + notes justify separation perfectly; no flaw.

Nearly flawless execution; deductions only for edge-case rule-stretching and micro-clarities. 10.0 requires zero subjectivity or omissions.
