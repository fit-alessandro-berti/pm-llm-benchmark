**8.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation
The answer is strong overall—thorough identification of *all* intra-case recurrences (Verify Documents in C001/C003; Call Customer in C002), clear contextual interpretations, a well-structured revised log mirroring the original format, and concise justifications tied to clues. Renaming for Verify Documents is flawless: "Initial Document Verification" perfectly captures primary checks (e.g., "Agent checks identity documents," "Physical verification of ID," "Identity verification"), while "Re-verify Documents" precisely reflects post-update reviews (e.g., "now that ID scan is provided," "after account adjustment"). Applying "Initial" consistently to C002's single instance enhances disambiguation without harm.

However, deductions for multiple flaws (strict policy: even minor issues significantly lower score; this is not "nearly flawless"):

- **Logical flaw/inaccuracy in renaming non-recurring "Call Customer" instances (major, -1.0)**: Task specifies identifying/renaming *activities that recur within the same case* ("appear multiple times within the same case"). Call Customer recurs *only* in C002, yet answer renames single occurrences in C001/C003 to "Call Customer for Clarification." C001 fits ("request missing docs" = clarification/info-gathering), but **C003 does not** ("Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return" = logistical recall/summoning, not clarification of info/discrepancy). This misapplies the name, distorting context and failing "clearly reflect their contextual differences." Should leave non-recurring as "Call Customer" or rename *only* if perfectly analogous (not here).

- **Overstepping task scope (moderate, -0.4)**: Renames non-recurring Calls and C002's single Verify, unrequired by "For each activity that recurs, rename them." While consistent naming aids disambiguation (task goal), it introduces risk of inaccuracy (as above) without justification mentioning broader application.

- **Minor unclarity in justification (-0.2)**: Call Customer section explicitly says "(in C002)," but log applies renames beyond—creates disconnect/misleads on scope.

- **Formatting nitpicks (-0.1 each, total -0.2)**: Inconsistent **bolding** (highlights some changes, not others); slight naming parallelism issue ("Initial *Document* Verification" vs. "Re-verify *Documents*"—wording varies trivially); table separators fine but original had per-case tables (answer's split is close but not identical).

No other recurrences missed; non-recurring activities (e.g., Adjust Account) untouched—correct. C002 Call renames ("for Clarification"/"Follow-up") impeccable. Starts at 10.0, docks total 1.8 for precision. Very high but not flawless due to C003 mismatch and scope creep.
