The answer precisely identifies the violating cases (2, 3, and 5) with no omissions or false positives—Case 1 and 4 are correctly cleared. Explanations directly reference and accurately quote the normative text's rules and constraints (e.g., payment before packaging, Ship never after Cancel, mandatory Package before Ship). Logical inferences (e.g., Authorize implies sufficient inventory, thus invalidates later Cancel in Case 3) align perfectly with the description without overreaching or introducing unsupported ambiguities. Structure is clear and task-complete; ambiguity resolution reinforces strict adherence. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws.
