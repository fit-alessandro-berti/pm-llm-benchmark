The provided answer is nearly flawless. The SQL query precisely identifies cases with the required consecutive sequence using `LEAD` window functions (correctly capturing direct succession via `LEAD(activity, 1)` and `LEAD(activity, 2)`), computes the exact time difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events in that sequence (`next_ts2 - next_ts1 > INTERVAL '5 days'`), collects those `case_id`s, and excludes all events from matching cases via `NOT IN`. DuckDB syntax is correct, including interval handling and window partitioning/ordering by `timestamp`. Edge cases (insufficient events, non-consecutive sequences, time 5 days, multiple sequences per case) are handled implicitly and correctly. The query returns all columns/events from non-matching cases as required, with no extraneous grouping/ordering needed (prompt does not specify output order). Explanation is clear and accurate. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. Minor style notes (e.g., `NOT EXISTS` or `DISTINCT` for robustness) are unnecessary given assumptions and do not detract.
