**2.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Structure and Format (minor positive, but trivial)**: Correctly uses Python dict with exact keys (`'equivalence'`, etc.) and sets/tuples/dicts as specified. `activ_freq` and `directly_follows` perfectly formatted. +1 point baseline.
- **Activity Frequencies (`activ_freq`)**: Assumes exactly once per activity (`{1}` for all 10). Scenario implies a mandatory linear process per order, but RP ("once the customer pays") could logically allow 0 in incomplete cases; however, prompt focuses on complete fulfillment, so defensible. No bounds violation. **Flawless here.**
- **Directly-Follows**: Perfect linear chain `RO  CA  RI  PI  QC  PO  GSL  D  IC  RP` matches scenario dependencies exactly (receive  check  reserve  pick  QC  pack  label  dispatch  invoice  payment). Enforces immediate succession correctly. **Flawless.**
- **Never Together**: Empty set correct—no activities conflict or are mutually exclusive. **Flawless.**
- **Equivalence**: Catastrophic. Lists ~50 forward-only pairs (e.g., `('RO', 'RP')`), claiming "all pairs equivalent" due to `{1}` freq. But:
  - Definition is *directed*: `('A', 'B')` means *if A occurs, then #A = #B*. Forward-only means if early occurs  late matches, but *not vice versa* (no `('RP', 'RO')`). Fails bidirectionality; breaks full equivalence class.
  - Redundant/overkill (transitive chain suffices); clutters without need since `activ_freq` already enforces #=1 .
  - With `activ_freq`, equivalence is unnecessary/redundant. -3 points.
- **Always Before**: Fundamentally broken. Same forward pairs as equivalence (e.g., `('RO', 'CA')`). Definition: *if first occurs, second executed *previously***  `('RO', 'CA')` demands CA *before* RO. Impossible in any valid trace (RO first). Model rejects *all* traces. No reverses like `('CA', 'RO')`. Copy-paste error from equivalence. **Fatal logical flaw.** -3 points.
- **Always After**: Equally broken. Reverse pairs (e.g., `('CA', 'RO')`). Definition: *if first occurs, second executed *after***  demands RO *after* CA. Again, impossible; rejects all traces. Swapped semantics with before. **Fatal logical flaw.** -3 points.
- **Overall Model Validity**: Combined relational constraints make skeleton *unsatisfiable*—no trace complies (violates before/after immediately). Direct/freq can't salvage; declares invalid process. Ignores transitivity/implications.
- **Reasoning**: Identifies correct sequence and "exactly once," but justifications lie ("all pairs equivalent"—not implemented bidirectionally; ignores directional defs). "Streamlined process" ignores self-contradictions. Unclear/overconfident.
- **Completeness/Minimalism**: Over-specifies redundant pairs (100s implied transitively); ignores scenario nuances (e.g., no equivalence needed).
- **Strict Deductions**: Major semantic inversions (before/after) = auto-fail on core constraints (60% of relations). Incomplete equivalence. Minor: No bidirectional pairs; assumes freq without evidence for RP=1 mandatorily. Only survives on 2/6 keys flawless.

**Net: 2.0**. Captures intent/sequence but outputs broken model. Needs total rewrite of relations for >5.0.
