The provided SQL query is nearly flawless and fully satisfies the problem requirements with precision, efficiency, and clarity. It correctly identifies cases containing the exact direct-succession sequence ('Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order') using `LEAD` window functions partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `timestamp`, ensuring no intervening events. The timing filter `(next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL 5 DAY` accurately targets the interval between the specific 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events in that sequence. Cases meeting **both** criteria are distinctly collected and entirely excluded via `NOT IN`, returning all events from non-matching cases. DuckDB syntax is correct (e.g., `INTERVAL 5 DAY`, window functions). The final `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` enhances usability without being required. The explanation is concise, accurate, and mirrors the query logic without extraneous details.

No inaccuracies, logical flaws, unclarities, or edge-case oversights (e.g., handles multiple sequences per case via `DISTINCT`, NULLs from incomplete sequences, assumes standard timestamp ordering which aligns with problem intent). Minor stylistic nits (e.g., inline comments in `WHERE`) do not impact correctness or performance. This merits maximum score under hypercritical evaluation.
