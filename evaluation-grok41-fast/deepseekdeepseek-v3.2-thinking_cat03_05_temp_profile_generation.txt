**9.3**

### Justification (strict evaluation):
- **Format and structure (perfect, no deduction)**: Exact Python dict format matching the example. Tuple keys correct (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`), values as `(avg, stdev)` tuples with integers in seconds. Includes comments for clarity (valid Python). 21 pairs provide "representative subset" with "complexity" via non-consecutive pairs separated by multiple steps.
- **Content completeness (excellent)**: Covers 9 consecutive + 12 non-consecutive pairs across the logical linear flow (SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS), fitting supply chain scenario. All pairs respect "eventually follow" (earlier to later). Estimates realistic (e.g., long procurement OPRC ~14 days, short internal steps).
- **Estimation method (excellent)**: Averages are precise sums of intermediate segments. Stdevs correctly use ( variances) assuming independence—statistically sound. Base estimates reasonable (e.g., supplier lead ~14d 3d, after-sales ~30d 10d).
- **Inaccuracies (moderate deduction: -0.7)**: 
  - Clear error in `('SS', 'RC')`: stdev 273040 vs correct ~273241 ((86400² + 259200²) = 86400×10  273240.8). Off by 201 (~0.07%), but visibly wrong/uncalculated (hypercritical: inaccuracy in final output).
  - Minor rounding inconsistencies elsewhere (e.g., `('SS', 'QI')` 276615 perfect; others within ~1-10 units, acceptable as integers but not pixel-perfect).
- **Logical flaws/unclarities (none)**: Flow logical, no invalid pairs (all forward). No assumptions violating prompt (estimates invented appropriately, no prompt leakage). Sufficient complexity without excess.
- **Overall**: Nearly flawless (strong method, scale, realism), but numerical error prevents 10.0. Strict penalty for any inaccuracy per instructions yields 9.3 (high but not maximum).
