9.2

### Explanation of Grade
This is an exceptionally strong answer—clear structure, accurate verdicts on all cases (correctly identifies conformant cases 1 and 4, non-conformant 2, 3, and 5), precise quoting of the normative text, logical case-by-case breakdown with sequences restated for clarity, and a concise summary. It interprets ambiguities reasonably (e.g., cautious on Authorize before Cancel in Case 3) and sticks closely to described constraints without overreaching.

**Minor deductions (-0.8 total):**
- **Incomplete violations in Case 3 (significant but not verdict-changing flaw, -0.5):** Flags the explicit "never ship after cancellation" correctly and notes path semantics, but omits the equally explicit key constraint "Ship order should only occur after packaging" (no Package occurs at all before Ship). This is identical to Case 5's flagged violation but unmentioned here, creating analytical inconsistency. Hypercritical note: the answer lists this constraint in its intro summary but fails to apply it uniformly—a logical oversight, though the primary unique violation (post-cancel ship) is nailed.
- **Slight vagueness in Case 2's second violation (-0.2):** Describes "precondition for legitimate shipping is broken" as derivative of prior error, but doesn't tie it directly to constraints like Authorize < Package < Ship chain; minor since primary violation is crystal clear.
- **Soft-pedaling Case 3 Authorize-then-Cancel (-0.1):** Calls it "not explicitly forbidden" but "inconsistent"—accurate but could more assertively reference "directly proceed to Cancel" and "payment only makes sense once sufficiency known," per description.

No factual errors, no wrong verdicts, no unclarities, excellent fidelity to text. Nearly flawless under hypercritical lens; only the Case 3 omission prevents 10.0.
