The provided final SQL query is correct, complete, and precisely matches the requirements. It uses a standard subquery with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to identify qualifying `case_id` values (those with `COUNT(*) <= 6`), then filters the full `event_log` table to return all original events (via `SELECT *`) for only those cases. This is efficient, DuckDB-compatible, preserves all columns including unspecified ones, handles grouping accurately, and has no syntax errors, ambiguities, extraneous output, or logical flaws.
