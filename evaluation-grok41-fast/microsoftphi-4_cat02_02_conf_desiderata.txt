**Grade: 3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This grading is based on utmost strictness, treating **any inaccuracy, omission of required analysis, unclarity, logical flaw, or failure to fully address the task as warranting major deductions**. Minor issues alone dock 1-2 points; major ones (e.g., missing key violations, hallucinating log events) dock 3+ points from a baseline. Perfect structure and coverage of *some* points start at ~7; flaws cascade downward. Only 9-10 for near-flawlessness (complete, precise, no errors).

#### Strengths (Supporting ~5.0 baseline before deductions):
- Good structure mirroring the task (Part 1/2 separation, case-by-case, justifications section).
- Correctly identified **no normative violations in Case 1 and Case 3**.
- For Case 2 normative: Accurately flagged Risk Assessment before Credit Check and Finalize Documentation after rejection (matches log annotations).
- Desiderata for Case 1 and Case 3: Precise, with approximate timings reasonable (e.g., Case 3 ~48-51h calcs close enough; clarified "suboptimal" implicitly via "not severe" context).
- Justifications provided for all cases, somewhat in line with task (e.g., "resource constraints").
- Minor positive: Noted desiderata are not normative; summary correct on "only Case 2 normative."

#### Major Deductions (Cascading to 3.0):
1. **Omission of key normative violation in Case 2 (-2.0)**: Completely missed absence of "Inform Applicant," which is **strictly required** after *every* Loan Decision (per sequence: Decision  Inform  [branch]). Log has Decision (09:30)  Finalize (10:00)  Close (10:30), skipping Inform entirely. This is a clear sequence skip (not allowed), separate from the two violations noted. Explanation incomplete—task demands *all* violations explained. Logical flaw: Claims "sequence" violated only via order, ignoring this.
   
2. **Hallucination/inaccuracy in Case 2 desiderata (-2.0)**: Falsely asserts "applicant was informed within less than 2 hours, meeting the recommendation." **No such event exists in the log**—pure invention. This misreads the log, creates logical contradiction (can't time a non-event), and undermines timeliness analysis. Since desiderata includes "Inform promptly within 48h of decision," absence is a failure (infinite delay), not "met." Hypercritical: This is not "unclarity"—it's a factual error.

3. **Incomplete normative analysis for Case 2 (-1.0)**: While order and finalize noted, no mention of Close Case without prior Inform (violates "no skipping"). Ties to #1; explanation not exhaustive.

4. **Minor unclarities/logical issues (-0.5 cumulative)**:
   - Case 1 desiderata: "Not logged, thus missing" good inference, but log only explicitly notes for Case 3—consistent application would note for all, but ok.
   - Case 2 desiderata: "Credit Check and Risk Assessment Timing: Although not recommended, the delayed order... does not affect" — unclear/logically odd; order is normative, but desiderata timing from *App Received* (Credit was ~1h, fine)—ties wrongly to normative.
   - Phrasing: "Credit Check before Risk Assessment: The log shows Risk... violates" — awkward double-negative.
   - Extraneous: "Finalize Documentation: Violates normative, not desideratum" in desiderata section (redundant); unasked "Training... audits" in summary.

#### Overall:
- ~60% accurate (strong on Cases 1/3, partial Case 2), but core task failures on Case 2 (missed violation + fabrication) make it unreliable. Not "suboptimal" analysis—fundamentally flawed. Far from flawless; would mislead on compliance. 3.0 reflects "adequate skeleton with critical gaps/errors."
