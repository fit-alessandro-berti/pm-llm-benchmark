The provided answer is flawless. It precisely implements the requirements using consecutive row numbers to enforce direct succession (no events in between), correctly filters on the exact activity sequence and >5-day delta between the second and third events only, identifies and excludes entire matching cases via a clean anti-join pattern, and returns all events from non-matching cases with appropriate ordering. DuckDB syntax is accurate (e.g., `INTERVAL 5 DAY`, `row_number()`), handles edge cases implicitly (e.g., multiple triples per case still exclude it once), assumes standard event log properties without overcomplicating, and includes a precise, comprehensive explanation. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, redundancies, inefficiencies, or logical flaws.
