The provided answer is flawless. The SQL query precisely meets all requirements: it correctly constructs ordered activity sequences per `case_id` using `string_agg` with `ORDER BY timestamp` (DuckDB-supported syntax), groups and counts variants accurately via CTEs, identifies top-K via `ORDER BY frequency DESC LIMIT :k` (with clear parameterization instructions), and filters the original event log to return only events from matching cases via correct INNER JOINs, preserving all specified columns. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, ambiguities, or inefficiencies; edge cases (e.g., ties handled by standard SQL semantics, consistent delimiter for uniqueness) are implicitly robust. Explanation is precise, modular, and directly tied to prompt steps without extraneous content.
