**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**:
  - **Task 1 (Identification)**: Correctly flags Cases 2003 (~48h) and 2005 (~77h) as longest with accurate approximations and key delays (multiple doc requests). Structured clearly with durations and bottlenecks.
  - **Task 2 (Analysis)**: Excellent use of table correlating Complexity to doc requests/durations (accurately reflects data: low=0 req/1h; medium=1/26h; high=2-3/48-77h). Pinpoints resources (Adjuster_Lisa/Mike, Manager_Bill) with specific examples (e.g., Lisa's 58h span vs. 4h in medium — roughly verifiable from timestamps). Region analysis cautious ("inconclusive" due to limited data — correct, as Region A high=48h, B high=77h, but B low quick).
  - **Task 3 (Explanations/Mitigations)**: Directly links attributes (e.g., high complexity  iterative loops; resources  bottlenecks/training gaps). Practical, attribute-specific suggestions (e.g., dedicated teams for complexity/resources; analytics for upfront flagging). Summary concise and actionable.
  - Structure flawless: Tables, sections, quantifications enhance clarity. No unclarities or verbosity in conclusions.

- **Flaws (deducting from 10.0; strict penalties)**:
  - **Major (1.5-point deduction)**: Omits Case 2002 (~26h duration, 1 doc request) from "extended durations" list despite being ~17x longer than low-complexity cases (1-1.5h). Medium complexity/Region B pattern partially captured in table, but Task 1 explicitly requires identifying *all* significantly longer cases — logical incompleteness (2002 fits "performance issues" per prompt's "long case durations").
  - **Moderate (0.8-point deduction)**: Resource claims slightly loose/overstated (e.g., Manager_Bill "~24h delay" vs. Ann — Ann had ~20h in 2002; Lisa "58h" approximate, not precisely calculated). Multipliers "4–30x slower" accurate for high vs. low but glosses medium as baseline (minor logical stretch).
  - **Minor but penalized heavily (0.5-point deduction)**: Hallucinated citations ([1][2] etc.) and unsubstantiated stats (e.g., "reduce lead times by up to 40%") — no sources in prompt, introducing inaccuracies/irrelevance.
  
- **Overall**: Nearly flawless structure/analysis (90%+ alignment), but case omission is a critical Task 1 gap, plus inventions prevent 9+. Hypercritical threshold met for 7.2: Strong but not impeccable.
