**10.0**

The answer is exemplary and flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It precisely identifies violators (Cases 2, 3, 5) with zero inaccuracies, fully aligning with the normative description's explicit sequences, constraints (e.g., ordering dependencies like Package only after Authorize, Ship only after Package/never after Cancel, branching logic post-Check), and implied intents (e.g., Authorize only for sufficient-inventory paths). All explanations directly reference the text, resolve ambiguities logically (e.g., Authorize in cancellation path as misapplication), and avoid overinterpretation. Structure (tables, visuals like strikethrough, bolding) enhances clarity without introducing flaws. No logical gaps, unclarities, extraneous details, or misses—every case is exhaustively but concisely assessed. Summary table perfectly encapsulates findings. This meets "nearly flawless" (actually flawless) criteria for maximum score.
