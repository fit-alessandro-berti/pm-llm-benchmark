**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
The answer is strong in structure (excellent use of tables for clarity), comprehensive coverage of normative violations, and creative yet constraint-aligned justifications. It correctly identifies Case 2's three hard violations (out-of-order Risk Assessment, missing Inform Applicant, forbidden Finalize after rejection) with precise timestamps and rule mappings. Case 1 and 3 are accurately cleared of normative issues. Desiderata are properly framed as non-severe. Summary is concise and actionable. Justifications are plausible reconciliations (e.g., prescreen, unlogged email) without denying violations.

**Deduction reasons (strictly applied, even minors accumulate to -0.8 total):**
- **Minor inaccuracy/incompleteness in Part 2 (desiderata, -0.3):** Follow-up Call is "encouraged" (thus a desiderata condition); log shows none for *any* case (activities absent, Case 3 explicitly notes it). Answer lists it only for Case 3 but marks Case 1/2 as "–" (implying no fails), inconsistently treating omission as a "fail" only when highlighted. Case 2 also fails "prompt inform" desiderata (never informed = not within 48h), yet marked "–" as "secondary." Incomplete identification.
- **Presentation unclarities/sloppiness (-0.3):** Typos/missing spaces ("Normativerule," "softrule," "hardrule," "Approved Finalise Close," "within0.5h," "within2h," "wellinformed," inconsistent "followup"/"Follow-up"). Awkward table cell breaks (<br>, double spaces). Bold/italics inconsistent (e.g., **Case** vs plain). Reduces polish/readability.
- **Minor unclarities/logical nitpicks (-0.2):** Justifications table headers "Observation | Reasonable justification" but rows prefix "**Case2 –**" repetitively (unclear if exhaustive). Case 1 desiderata claims "all timing recommendations satisfied *and* optional call omitted permissible," blurring "permissible" (not required) with "meets desiderata" (encouraged = ideally met). No explicit note that Case 2 Credit timing *would* meet desiderata if order fixed.

Flawless content/content logic would be 10.0; these prevent it (per instructions). Still very high due to near-perfect normative analysis and overall utility.
