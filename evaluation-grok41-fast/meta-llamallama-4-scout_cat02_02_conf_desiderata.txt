**5.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (partial credit, ~50% alignment):** Correctly identifies Case 1 as fully normative-compliant. Correctly flags Case 2 as normative violator with *some* reasons (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection). Correctly states Case 3 is normative-compliant and flags its desiderata timing issues (credit check >24h; inform >48h). Distinguishes normative (strict) vs. desiderata (recommended). Case 2 summary notes "skips steps" vaguely.
- **Major Inaccuracies/Omissions (severe deductions):**
  - **Misses core normative violation in Case 2:** No "Inform Applicant" activity *at all* (required after *every* Loan Decision per rules/sequence). Log clearly skips it entirely—explicit strict rule violation equivalent to order/skip prohibitions. Answer never mentions or explains this (huge flaw; ~20% deduction alone).
  - **Misclassifies desiderata into normative analysis:** Step 4 claims Case 3 normative analysis includes "delay in informing the applicant"—delays are *exclusively* desiderata, not normative (sequence ordering is satisfied). Blurs strict distinction (~15% deduction).
  - **Incomplete desiderata coverage:** Lists Follow-up Call as desiderata (Step 6) but *never analyzes it* (Case 3 explicitly notes absence; Cases 1-2 implicitly none). Fails to identify suboptimal behavior for any case on this (~10% deduction). Calls desiderata "violates" without clarifying "not severe, suboptimal" as tasked.
  - **Incomplete/unclear normative explanations:** Case 2 lists partial sequence (implicitly omits Inform but doesn't explain as violation). No mention of other Case 2 issues (e.g., no Risk Assessment *after* corrected Credit Check order).
- **Logical Flaws/Unclarities (~15% deduction):**
  - Step 8 wrongly claims Case 2 "does not provide information on timing"—log *has* timestamps (e.g., Credit Check <24h despite order violation).
  - Repetitive/overly verbose (Steps 2-4, 7-9, 10-11 redundant summaries); doesn't structure clearly around Task's 1-2-3 (e.g., no explicit sections).
  - Task 3 (interpretations/justifications) weak/vague: Step 12 offers no "in line with constraints" suggestions (e.g., no possible justifications like data issues for Case 3 delays; just generic "mishandled"/"need efficiency").
- **Structural/Other Flaws (~10% deduction):** Weird $\boxed{Case 2}$ at end—misinterprets task (no such request; ignores desiderata/Task 3). Minor rephrasing of rules ok but numbering inconsistent/messy (## Step 1, then 2: etc.).
- **Overall:** ~50% accurate but riddled with critical misses (e.g., skipped mandatory step), misplacements, incompleteness. Not "nearly flawless"—mid-low score warranted under hypercritical strictness.
