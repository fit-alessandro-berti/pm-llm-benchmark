**4.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Major Inaccuracy (Fatal for High Score)**: The proposed `loop_IQC = *(AS, IQC)` generates traces strictly alternating AS-(IQC AS)* (e.g., AS; AS IQC AS; AS IQC AS IQC AS), but **Case 3 has AS IQC IQC AS IQC AS** (consecutive IQCs without intervening AS). This trace is impossible in the model, yet the answer explicitly claims it "captures all observed paths (Cases 1–5)". Direct logical flaw; model fails reproducibility for ~20% of traces. Deduction: -3.0.
- **Reasoning Flaws & Unclarities**: Rambling, repetitive (multiple "but wait", "not quite right", "actually"), contradictory loops deliberations (e.g., confuses A/B roles in POWL loop semantics repeatedly). Fails to analyze Case 3 sequence explicitly despite listing "3 IQC". Overlooks consecutive IQCs entirely. Unintuitive justifications (e.g., "IQC is not part of the loop body — it’s the bridge"). Deduction: -1.5.
- **Minor Inaccuracies**: 
  - `loop_RT = *(TST, RT)` fits Cases 1/3/5 (TST (RT TST)*) and Case 2/4 (TST exit), good.
  - `xor_LB = X(LB, tau)` correctly optionals LB post-PK.
  - Sequential partial order correct (no concurrency observed; timestamps linear).
  - Code syntactically valid, uses correct POWL classes/operators.
  - But root PO edges complete/minimal? Yes, but `add_edge(DP, D)` minor typo risk (should be `root.order.add_edge(DP, D)` explicit).
  Deduction: -0.5 (minors compound).
- **Strengths (Partial Credit)**: Captures Cases 1,2,4,5 perfectly; approximates Case 3; overall structure (initial seq + loops + optional + end seq) sensible; no extraneous concurrency/choices; text/code dual presentation clear.
- **Overall**: Competent approximation (~80% coverage) but not "represents this complex process" fully. Far from flawless; strict policy demands deduction for any inaccuracy/logic gap. Ceiling crushed by Case 3 failure.
