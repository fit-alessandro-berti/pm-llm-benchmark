The provided answer is nearly flawless: the SQL query is logically correct, efficient, and precisely meets the requirements by using a CTE to compute event counts per `case_id`, joining back to retrieve all events (`event_log.*`), and filtering via `WHERE event_count <= 6`. This excludes all events from cases with >6 events while preserving the full set for qualifying cases, with proper grouping (`GROUP BY case_id`) and no data loss or duplication issues. DuckDB compatibility is unproblematic (standard SQL features).

The explanation is clear, structured, and directly maps to the query steps without extraneous details or errors. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, syntax issues, or unnecessary assumptions (e.g., handles varying column counts via `.*`, no unneeded `ORDER BY` or `DISTINCT`). Alternative approaches (e.g., window functions) exist but are not required; this is optimal as-is.
