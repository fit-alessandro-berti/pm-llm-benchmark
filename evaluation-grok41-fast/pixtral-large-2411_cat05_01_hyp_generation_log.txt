**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (supporting score above 5):**
- **Anomaly Identification (8/10):** Accurately spots key issues like out-of-order sequences in cases 1002/1003, missing activities in 1003/1004, early payment in 1004, and policy flags via `additional_info`. Specific case references and ties to normal flow are precise. Minor plus for noting department-implied violations indirectly.
- **Hypotheses (8/10):** Covers required examples (system errors, policy violations, training issues) plus operational constraints. Logical and data-grounded (e.g., flags, sequences).
- **Query Relevance & Variety (7/10):** Uses all tables (`order_event_log`, `orders`, `resources`). PostgreSQL-specific syntax (e.g., `BOOL_OR`) correct. Queries 2-6 are solid: Q2 detects missing activities accurately; Q3 correctly finds pre-invoice payments via correlated subquery (works in PostgreSQL despite no outer alias); Q4 parses `additional_info` well; Q5/Q6 link to resources/orders for incomplete cases (good proxy).
- **Structure & Clarity (9/10):** Well-organized sections, concise, no fluff.

**Flaws Deducting Points (strict deductions for inaccuracies/logical gaps; each major flaw -0.5 to -1.0):**
- **Major Inaccuracy in Q1 (-1.0):** Labeled "Identify Out-of-Order Activities," but subquery targets cases with `<2` counts of `Credit Check`/`Validate Stock` (i.e., missing at least one), then pulls shipments. Misses core out-of-order case 1002 (both activities present, COUNT=2, but timestamps wrong: shipments before checks). Fails to detect sequence violations (e.g., no `LAG`, `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) != event_id`, or timestamp comparisons like `MIN(shipment_ts) < MAX(credit_ts)`). Logical mismatch between anomaly description and query purpose.
- **Missed Anomalies (-0.6):** Omits invoicing before shipment confirmation (1003: `Issue Invoice` 09:30 > `Ship Goods` 09:10 but before `Confirm Shipment` 09:45); shipment despite `scheduled=N` (1004); potential dept violations (e.g., Logistics before Finance in 1002); priority order (1002) correlation with skips. Not exhaustive.
- **Incomplete Sequence Detection (-0.5):** No dedicated query for general deviations (e.g., `activity` not in expected order by timestamp/resource dept). Relies on count/missing proxies, missing 1002 (complete count=7 but anomalous).
- **Hypotheses Weak Ties (-0.3):** Generic; doesn't hypothesize data-specific causes (e.g., `priority` order_type skips checks; low `credit_score` ignored in 1002/1003; high-value 1004 fraud via early payment).
- **Minor SQL Issues (-0.2):** Q1/Q5 use `<7` count (assumes exactly 7 normal; brittle if variants exist). Q3 alias sloppy (outer unaliased; works but unprofessional). No `ORDER BY timestamp` in sequence queries.
- **Unclarity/Overclaim (-0.2):** Q1 implies out-of-order detection but proxies missing; anomalies section claims 1003 "out-of-order Ship Goods before Validate Stock" (accurate but Validate fully absent, not just reordered).

**Overall:** Strong but not "nearly flawless" (flawed Q1, gaps in sequence detection, missed details prevent 9+). 7.2 reflects quality with strict penalties for logical/SQL mismatches.
