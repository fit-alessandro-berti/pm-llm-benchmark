**9.7**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Accuracy (perfect)**: All factual references to logs are precise (e.g., correct scores, adjustments, timestamps irrelevant but not misused, exact examples like U003 695705 Approved vs. P002 710 Rejected). Correctly identifies bias mechanism (+10 "Community Boost" conditionally applied only in Group B log based on LocalResident=TRUE + CommunityGroupNone). Notes aggregate rates similar (2/3 approved each) but mechanism differs—spot-on. No inventions or misreads (e.g., doesn't claim all Group B get boost; excludes U002 correctly).
- **Clarity and Structure (excellent)**: Short answer up front, then evidence  outcomes  systematic diff  framing  consequences  remediation. Bullet points crisp; examples concrete. No jargon overload; arrows () enhance readability.
- **Logical Completeness (near-perfect)**: Fully addresses question—compares logs, IDs bias favoring Group B log (exhibits favorable adjustments absent in A), explains manifestation via attributes/ScoreAdjustment leading to systematic differences (e.g., pathway for lower prelim scores to approve). Discusses disparate treatment/proxy risks aptly. Hypothetical "without boost" for U003 logical (inferred threshold ~720 from P001/P002). Extra remediation/next steps add value without distracting.
- **Minor Deductions (hypercritical)**:
  - **Ambiguous phrasing on "which log" (0.2 deduct)**: Question says "which log exhibits bias"; answer implies Group B (via "bias in favor of Group B") but doesn't explicitly state "The Group B log exhibits bias (favoring its applicants)". Minor unclarity—could be read as logs jointly biased.
  - **Missed anomaly (0.1 deduct)**: Doesn't explicitly flag U003 (705 Approved) vs. P002 (710 Rejected)—stronger evidence of bias (lower adjusted score approved in B). Implied via "likely would not have passed" but not highlighted for emphasis.
  - **Trivial formatting (negligible, but noted)**: Double space "720  730"; not impacting substance.
- **No major flaws**: No inaccuracies, no overreach (e.g., doesn't assume unshown threshold), no logical gaps (e.g., acknowledges small sample), no unclarities. Far exceeds basics; proactive offers (a/b/c) demonstrate depth. Nearly flawless under strict lens—very high score warranted.
