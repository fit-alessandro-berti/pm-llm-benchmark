**3.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Major Format Violations (fatal, -4.0+ penalty)**: The prompt **explicitly requires** `{'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}` for **all** keys, including binary ones (`response`, `responded_existence`, etc.), as "corresponding value the support (1.0) and confidence of the declarative rule." Unary keys (`existence`, etc.) are correct in the "standard" version, but **all binary constraints lack any support/confidence**—they use bare `{'IG': ['DD']}` lists. This is not a minor omission; it's a complete failure to match the specified structure for ~70% of keys. First `declare_model` exacerbates this with misplaced top-level `support`/`confidence` (e.g., `responded_existence: {'IG': ['DD'], 'support': 1.0}`—invalid nesting).
- **Structural Inconsistencies (-1.5)**: Presents **two dictionaries**, first malformed/incomplete (e.g., `existence` only partial; `response`/`precedence` lack sup/conf entirely). "Standard" fixes some but introduces `responded_existence` as forward-reversed pairs (e.g., `'DD': ['IG']`—logically nonsensical; see below). Unnecessary `if __name__ == "__main__":` print block is extraneous code not requested.
- **Logical Flaws in Constraints (-1.5)**: 
  - `responded_existence` in "standard" reversed (e.g., `'DD': ['IG']` implies "if DD then IG exists afterward"—impossible in linear IGDD flow; should be `'IG': ['DD']`).
  - First `declare_model`: `precedence` comments/logic inverted (e.g., `'DD': ['TFC']` with comment "TFC must precede DD"—false; TFC follows DD). `coexistence` wrongly used/populated.
  - Succession/response/precedence redundantly chain the **exact same linear flow**, bloating without variation; real DECLARE models differentiate (e.g., no `alt*` or negative constraints despite "complex" scenario).
- **Incompleteness/Unclarities (-0.5)**: `existence` incomplete in first dict; "standard" assumes all exist without `exactly_one`/`absence` justification. Explanation misdefines `coexistence` ("can coexist"—wrong; it's mutual existence obligation) and ignores sup/conf absence. "Hypothetical" note admits fabrication without data-driven rationale.
- **Minor Issues (-0.3)**: Overly verbose explanation/usage/note not requested; assumes linearity ignoring "multi-department" complexity (no `noncoexistence` for parallel depts like TFC/CE).
- **Strengths (partial credit +1.0)**: Covers all required keys; linear chain semantically plausible for scenario; `init`/`existence` correct where formatted.

Nearly flawless requires **exact format match, zero logical errors, no extras**—this fails on core requirements. Equivalent to half-baked code with critical bugs.
