**2.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Task 1 (Identify long cases)**: Catastrophically flawed. Fundamentally miscalculates all multi-day durations by ignoring dates (e.g., Case 105 spans ~49 hours to Mar-03 09:30, Case 102 ~25 hours to Mar-02 09:15, Case 104 ~24 hours to Mar-02 08:30; these are the longest). Wrongly crowns Case 101 (only ~2.25h) as longest and lists absurd times (e.g., Case 105 as "65 minutes," Case 103 as "120 minutes" instead of ~80). No average computed; "significantly longer" claim baseless. Fatal inaccuracy.
- **Task 2 (Root causes)**: Built on false premises. Attributes delays to wrong cases/times (e.g., Case 101 "1 hour 40 minutes after assign" to investigate—in reality 40 min; ignores true delays in escalated multi-day cases like 105's post-escalation gap from Mar-01 10:00 to Mar-03 09:00). Lists escalations correctly for 102/105 but misses their true multi-day impact. Vague/unsubstantiated (e.g., "5-hour delay" in 105 ignores it's actually ~47 hours post-escalation). Logical flaws abound.
- **Task 3 (Explanations/Recommendations)**: Generic, uninsightful platitudes recycling flawed analysis (e.g., ties bottlenecks to non-issues like Case 101). No quantitative cycle time links; recommendations ignore real patterns (e.g., escalations + overnight delays in 102/104/105). No novel insights.
- **Overall**: Well-structured but content is nearly entirely inaccurate/unreliable. Minor positives (spotting escalations) drowned by core failures. Far from flawless—unsuitable for real analysis.
