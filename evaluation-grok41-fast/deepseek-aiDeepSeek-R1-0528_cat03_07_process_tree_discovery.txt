**2.0**

The provided process tree fundamentally fails to fit the event log, exhibiting zero fitness for Case 3 (AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC). The loop `* (tau, -> ('RMI', 'VF'))` generates only zero or more disjoint blocks of **RMI  VF** (e.g., empty, RMI VF, RMI VF RMI VF), which cannot produce consecutive **RMI  RMI  VF** (no mechanism for multiple RMI without intervening VF). This is a critical logical flaw and inaccuracy, misrepresenting the "repeating loop for missing information and re-validation" (actual log shows blocks of 1+ RMI followed by a single VF, not interleaved VF per RMI). The explanation falsely claims it "handles RMI+VF repetitions" for Case 3, compounding the error. While the overall sequence (RA  VF  AE  [loop]  AD  SC  AC) and zero-iteration handling for Case 2 are correct, the core loop mismatch destroys fitness balance. Minor positives (notation matches prompt style, simplicity) cannot offset this.
