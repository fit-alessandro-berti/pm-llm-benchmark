**3.2**

### Critical Evaluation Summary
This answer fails fundamentally on the core requirement of **direct succession** ("these three events must appear in this exact order, with no other event from the same case in between them"). It only verifies that the three activities exist in timestamp order via `MIN(timestamp)` per activity, which ignores intervening events entirely—a **major logical flaw** that renders the query incorrect for the prompt. Examples:
- Case with events: Approve  OtherActivity  Create  Confirm: Wrongly included as a "sequence" case.
- Case with Create (early)  Approve  Create  Confirm: `MIN`s might still order incorrectly or coincidentally pass.

This alone warrants a low score under hypercritical standards.

#### Additional Severe Issues (compounding deductions):
- **Incorrect `approve_time` alias**: `MIN(timestamp) AS approve_time` (unfiltered) computes the global min timestamp among *all three activities*, not Approve-specific. Only the `HAVING` clause coincidentally uses correct `FILTER`ed expressions. This is sloppy, produces misleading/wrong column, and breaks if non-Approve events precede Approve among the filtered rows.
- **No handling of duplicates/multiples**: `MIN`s pick earliest instances, ignoring if the ordered mins don't correspond to *consecutive* events (e.g., multiple Creates; sequence might skip).
- **Assumes unique timestamps/strict ordering**: No ties handling; prompt implies `ORDER BY timestamp` per case needed for true sequencing.
- **Inefficient/unnecessary `COUNT(DISTINCT activity)=3`**: Redundant with order checks but doesn't prove sequence.
- **DuckDB syntax minor risk**: `INTERVAL '5 days'` works but pedantically `INTERVAL 5 DAY` is safer; trivial but noted.

#### Minor Positives (limited credit):
- Correctly excludes *whole cases* matching both sequence + timing.
- CTE + `NOT IN` structure is efficient/logical for final filter.
- Explanation is clear but overclaims ("specific sequence") without addressing directness.
- Would "work" coincidentally for simple cases (no interveners/duplicates), justifying slight uplift from 1.0.

#### Path to 10.0:
Requires row_numbering per case (`PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp`), joins/LAG/LEAD for *consecutive* rn+1/rn+2 matches on exact activities, then timestamp diff on *those specific events*. This answer is nowhere near flawless—significant rework needed.
