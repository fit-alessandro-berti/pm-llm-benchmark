**9.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (why not lower)**:
  - **Query correctness (flawless, +10 potential)**: The CTE accurately computes event counts per `case_id` using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` (correct use of `HAVING` for aggregates). The `INNER JOIN` precisely filters to return *only* events (`e.*`) from qualifying cases, preserving all original columns. Handles the requirement perfectly: excludes >6 events cases, returns full events for <=6. Efficient, standard SQL (DuckDB-compatible). `ORDER BY` is logical for event logs (cases grouped, events chronological) and not harmful.
  - **Completeness**: Matches prompt exactly—identifies counts, excludes >6, returns full events for rest.

- **Issues (deductions for minor-to-moderate flaws, strictly applied)**:
  - **Explanation unclarity/incompleteness (-0.4)**: Bullet 2 states "passed the filter ( 6 events)"—mangled/incomplete phrasing (likely intended "<= 6 events" but appears truncated/broken). Creates minor confusion/reading hiccup; hypercritically, any textual ambiguity counts as "unclarity."
  - **Unnecessary elements (-0.2)**: Aliases `COUNT(*) as event_count` but never uses `event_count` (could omit for cleaner CTE: `SELECT case_id ...`). Minor bloat, not a flaw but not "minimal/perfect."
  - **Unrequested addition (-0.1)**: `ORDER BY` unasked for (prompt specifies no ordering). Nice-to-have, but adds unrequested output/behavior; strict reading penalizes extras.
  - **No major logical flaws, inaccuracies, or inefficiencies**: Window function alternative exists (e.g., `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) <=6`), but CTE+JOIN is equally valid/correct. No performance issue in DuckDB.

Nearly flawless query elevates score; explanation glitches prevent 10.0. Significantly lower than max per "even minor issues" rule, but not catastrophic (e.g., wrong filter would be <5).
