**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It delivers precisely what the prompt requires: a list of targeted, open-ended questions that systematically uncover missing details (e.g., weighting factors in Q4, qualitative tenant criteria in Q6), decision criteria (e.g., Q4–6), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q1–3), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q7–9), and exception handling (e.g., Q9–12). Every question ties directly to elements in the process description without introducing inaccuracies, logical gaps, or unclarities—e.g., Q2 probes post-marketing accountability logically extending from inspection/compliance mentions; Q17 verifies financial integration as a described quality check.

No requests for SQL, code, or implementation details; all remain conceptual (tool mentions in Q13/15 deepen communication flow already referenced in the description, without veering into technical specs). Structure enhances clarity without excess; 20 questions are comprehensive yet non-redundant, grouped logically. Intro/closing add value by framing without deviating. Zero flaws in alignment, phrasing, or scope—deserves maximum score.
