**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This grade reflects a solid structural effort but is dragged down significantly by **critical inaccuracies**, **omissions of key violations**, **logical flaws**, **factual errors**, and **unclarities**. Even though the answer is well-organized and covers ~70% of the requirements competently, the misses are not minor—they directly undermine the core task of precise violation identification, especially under "utmost strictness." High scores (9+ ) are reserved for nearly flawless responses; this has multiple flaws warranting deduction.

#### Strengths (Supporting the Base Score):
- **Structure and Coverage**: Mirrors the task's 3 parts clearly. Concise summary. Good interpretations in Part 3 (plausible justifications like "system glitch" align with constraints).
- **Correct Identifications**:
  - Case 2's Risk Assessment before Credit Check: Noted (core ordering violation).
  - Case 2's Finalize Documentation after rejection: Correctly flagged as prohibited.
  - Case 1: Accurately deemed normative-compliant and mostly desiderata-compliant.
  - Case 3: Correctly normative-compliant; delays properly identified as desiderata issues with clarification of "suboptimal" (e.g., "not a rule violation, it indicates a delay").
- **Tone**: Distinguishes normative (strict) vs. desiderata (suboptimal) well.

#### Major Flaws (Severe Deductions: -2.0 total):
1. **Missed Critical Normative Violation in Case 2 (Task 1)**: No "Inform Applicant" event after Loan Decision (required post-Decision for *all* outcomes per normative sequence: "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"). Case 2 jumps from Decision (Rejected, 09:30) to Finalize (10:00)  Close (10:30), skipping it entirely. This is a **third explicit violation** (not just two). Omitting it makes the analysis incomplete/false—Case 2 has *three* normative breaches, not two. Hypercritical: This is a "strict rules" core miss, invalidating the claim "two violations."
2. **Factual Error in Timestamps (Task 1)**: Case 2 Violation 1 cites "08:20 vs. 2024-01-11 08:20"—incorrect; it's Risk Assessment (08:20) vs. Credit Check (**09:00**). Obvious log-reading error undermines credibility.

#### Significant Flaws (Moderate Deductions: -1.5 total):
3. **Incomplete Desiderata Analysis (Task 2)**: 
   - Ignores "Follow-up Call" entirely (explicitly "encouraged—but not strictly required" before Close Case). Log notes it only for Case 3, but none appear in *any* case (Cases 1/2 also lack it). Should flag all as suboptimal deviations, clarifying non-severity. Case 3 explicitly calls it out—missed opportunity.
   - Case 2 desiderata: Vague/wrong claim ("speed... isn't necessarily *good*"). Reality: App (08:00)  Credit (~1h, *meets* <24h); but *no Inform at all* fails promptness desideratum. "Highlights severity of rule violations" dodges specifics.
4. **Logical Flaw/Unclarity in Case 1 Desiderata (Task 2)**: Claims "we don't have enough information to definitively say if the timing was optimal." False—timestamps prove optimal: App (09:00)  Credit (09:30, <24h); Decision (11:00)  Inform (13:00, ~2h <<48h). Unnecessary doubt introduces uncertainty where data is clear.

#### Minor Flaws (Minor Deductions: -0.5 total):
- Vague phrasing (e.g., Case 2 desiderata "doesn't meet... isn't necessarily good"—lacks specifics).
- No explicit "when possible" qualifier for interpretations (Task 3), though mostly reasonable.
- Minor redundancy (e.g., "serious process breakdown" restates obvious).

#### Overall:
- **Accuracy**: 70% (missed violation + errors = fatal for strict grading).
- **Completeness**: 80% (good coverage, but omissions).
- **Clarity/Logic**: 85% (strong structure, but flaws erode trust).
- Not "nearly flawless"—flaws are not edge cases; they're central to Task 1/2. Equivalent to a B-/C+ in academic terms, scaled to 6.0. Fix the Case 2 Inform miss + details  9.0+.
