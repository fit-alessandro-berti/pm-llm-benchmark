**3.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies (Partial credit, major flaw: ~4/10)**: Correctly flags `noncoexistence` for `E` with `"C"` as anomalous vs. intended flow (both occur sequentially), but fundamentally misinterprets "noncoexistence" as *allowing* EC (it actually *forbids* coexistence of E and C in a trace, directly contradicting the flow requiring both). Second anomaly ("ambiguous precedence") is contrived/non-existent; `existence` + `precedence` reinforce each other without conflict. Undermines business logic identification.
- **Hypotheses (~6/10)**: Plausible and matches prompt examples (e.g., misinterpretation, policy changes), but unprecise/tied to flawed anomaly read (e.g., "skipping steps" assumes allowance, not prohibition). Lacks depth on true contradiction (e.g., no hypothesis for why model forbids required steps).
- **SQL Verification (~1/10)**: Critically flawed, non-executable, schema-violating:
  | Issue | Impact |
  |-------|--------|
  | Invents non-existent `claim_events_participation` table & `resource_id` column (schema has `resource` VARCHAR in `claim_events`). | Queries 1 & 3 fail entirely. |
  | Confuses `event_id` (INT) with `activity` (VARCHAR): e.g., `event_id = 'P'`, `'R'`, `'A'`, `'C'`. | All queries syntactically invalid. |
  | Query 4: Pointless self-JOIN (`e.event_id = ce.event_id`); wrong condition (`c_event.timestamp < e.timestamp` checks C *before* E, opposite of "followed by"). |
  | Query 1: Unclear/irrelevant `NOT IN` on adjusters (why exclude home/auto specialists for closing?). No link to anomalies. |
  | No query checks core anomaly (E + C coexistence, e.g., `EXISTS` both activities per `claim_id`). Ignores timestamps/precedence properly. No `claims`/`adjusters` use beyond errors.
- **Overall**: Structure follows tasks, but logical flaws, misreads model, broken SQL make it unreliable. Minor clarity issues (e.g., vague "confirms claims closed without approval" in Q1). Not "nearly flawless"—significant deductions for core inaccuracies.
