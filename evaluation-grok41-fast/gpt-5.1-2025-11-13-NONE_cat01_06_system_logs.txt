**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (supporting high score):**
- **Format & Attributes**: Excellent CSV-like structure with required fields (Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp) plus useful extras (Application, Window, RawAction, Notes). Readable, tool-ready (e.g., ProM, Celonis importable after flattening). Timestamps preserved exactly.
- **Coverage**: All 26 raw events mapped (no omissions). Abstraction creative but faithful.
- **Activity Naming**: Strong standardization within types (e.g., "Edit content" for Word TYPING, "Compose reply" for email). Higher-level, meaningful (e.g., CLICK send  "Send email"). Context-aware (app/document-specific).
- **Case Logic**: Coherent per "logical unit of user work" (documents/files/emails as cases). Analyst-friendly for discovery (e.g., variants like open-edit-save-close). Interleaving handled via resume events. Narrative clear: tells stories of per-item workflows.
- **Explanation**: Thorough yet concise. Maps rawabstract explicitly. Describes narrative well. Acknowledges SWITCH handling.

**Flaws (deducting from 10.0; each minor= -0.2 to -0.5, major= -1.0+):**
- **Major: Event Duplication & 1:m Mapping (-1.2)**: Raw SWITCH 09:06:00 (ExcelDoc1) split into *two distinct log events* (Excel "Switch away" + Doc1 "Resume editing"), inflating to 27 events vs 26 raw. Violates clean transformation (each raw event  one log event). Fabricates without justification; PM logs avoid duplicate timestamps across cases for same source.
- **Major: Inconsistent SWITCH Assignment (-0.8)**: Explanation claims "to destination... and to source if leaving (Excel case)", but arbitrary—prior SWITCHes (e.g., Doc1Email, EmailPDF) assigned *only* to destination (no source "switch away"). Excel specially cased, leading to duplication. Breaks standardization; cases have uneven starts/ends (e.g., Excel/PDF end explicitly/abruptly, Email/Doc1-first via implicit).
- **Minor: Over-Interpretation of Brief Sessions (-0.3)**: Quarterly initial FOCUS (08:59:50  "Open document") lacks follow-up activity (immediate switch); feels like "Glance/Select" not full open-edit. Resume gap (7min) ok but weakens coherence.
- **Minor: Activity Standardization Gaps (-0.3)**: Names good but not fully uniform (e.g., "Open document"/"Open spreadsheet"/"Open email thread"; "Edit content" vs "Edit data"). Could standardize to "Initiate work on [item]" / "Update [type]".
- **Minor: No Explicit Aggregation (-0.1)**: Multiple TYPING/SCROLL as separate events (fine, but opportunity for "Draft content" aggregation if session-based).
- **Minor: Presentation (-0.1)**: Grouped by case (not single chronological CSV); requires reformat for direct import. Header "Activity" vs "Activity Name" nit.

**Overall**: Exceptionally strong (coherent, useful log; great inference from temporal/app context). Flaws are logical/inconsistent but don't destroy usability—still "suitable for analysis". 10.0 requires zero issues (perfect 1:1 mapping, uniform handling, flawless uniformity). 8.2 reflects "very good" with targeted deductions.
