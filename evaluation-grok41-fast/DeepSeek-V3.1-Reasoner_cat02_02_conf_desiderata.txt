### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (Near-Flawless Aspects):**
  - **Task Coverage (Perfect):** Precisely structures response into 1, 2, 3 as required. Identifies all normative violations accurately (Case 1/3: none; Case 2: exactly the three key ones—reversed order, missing Inform Applicant, forbidden Finalize after rejection). Desiderata correctly separated as "not severe/suboptimal," with per-case breakdowns. Interpretations provided only where relevant (Cases 2/3), reasonable, and aligned (e.g., human error, workload/weekends).
  - **Accuracy (Excellent):** All sequence/ordering checks correct. Timings precisely assessed (e.g., Case 1: 30min/2hr good; Case 2: ~1hr good; Case 3: ~49hr >24h, ~51hr >48h). Crucially spots missing Inform Applicant in Case 2 as **normative** violation (not just desiderata), which is spot-on and often overlooked.
  - **Clarity/Logic (Excellent):** Concise, tabular-log-referential, no ambiguities. Distinguishes normative vs. desiderata sharply. Nuanced Case 2 desiderata (partial meet for Credit Check; missing Inform as promptness fail without double-counting as normative).
  - **No Major Flaws:** Ignores think tag per instructions; conclusions standalone perfect.

- **Minor Deductions (Hypercritical Penalties, -0.2 total):**
  - **Phrasing Imprecision (Case 3 Desiderata, -0.1):** "Credit Check... over 48 hours after Application Received... (exceeding the 24-hour recommendation)." Factually true (~49hr >48hr >24hr), but "over 48 hours" slightly misaligns emphasis (rec is 24hr; implies 48hr rec briefly). Hypercritical: Could be "over 49 hours, exceeding 24-hour rec" for pixel-perfect.
  - **Over-Speculation (Interpretations, -0.1):** Case 3 justifies "weekend delays (Application Received on Friday..."—plausible (2024-01-12 was Friday), but dates unspecified in prompt; assumes external calendar knowledge. Minor logical stretch vs. "purely prompt-based" (e.g., "high workload/resource constraints"). Not inaccurate, but not "in line with given constraints" 100% (prompt lacks days).
  
Virtually flawless; only nitpicks prevent 10.0 under "utmost strictness/even minor issues significantly lower" (but not "significantly" here as impact negligible).
