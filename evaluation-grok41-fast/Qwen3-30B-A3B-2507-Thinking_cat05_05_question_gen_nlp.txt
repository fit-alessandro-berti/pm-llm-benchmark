The provided answer delivers exactly 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions that precisely align with the described supply chain process. Each question directly draws from specific elements in the description (e.g., suppliers by country, JIT vs. aggregated shipments, digital systems/ML, carbon footprint, warranties/recalls, time zones/currencies, VIP/DTC, etc.) without introducing external or inaccurate details. They focus sharply on insights, issues, improvements, and decision implications through hypothetical scenarios, trade-offs, and strategic probes (e.g., geopolitical risks, data integrity, regulatory adaptations). All are purely open-ended ("How...", "What...", "Could..."), free of yes/no structure, SQL, or any prohibited content. No repetitions, unclarities, logical flaws, or minor deviations—coverage is comprehensive, balanced across stages, and flawlessly executed.
