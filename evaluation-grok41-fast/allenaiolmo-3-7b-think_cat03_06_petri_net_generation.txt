**3.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Answer Only):
- **Fatal Syntax/API Errors (Major Deduction)**: The code uses nonexistent `net.transition("label", source=place, target=place)` method. pm4py's `PetriNet` has no such constructor with `source`/`target` kwargs. Correct usage requires: (1) `Transition(label)`, (2) `net.transitions.add(t)`, (3) `petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(place_from, t, net)` for input arc, (4) `petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t, place_to, net)` for output arc. This code crashes on execution (`AttributeError`), failing core task. Imports `petri_utils` but never uses it—direct violation of prompt.
- **Incorrect Loop Modeling (Major Logical Flaw)**: Self-loops (RDS: place2place2; II: place3place3) allow *indefinite* firings (consume/add token to same place), enabling nondeterministic behavior where FC/CA compete with loops forever. Does not model "if incomplete  RDS (multiple times)  continue" or fraud doubts  II (multiple)  CA. No control places/tokens for conditional/multiple bounded loops; violates "logical sequence with possible loops... multiple times before proceeding."
- **Incomplete Process Coverage (Significant Inaccuracies)**: 
  - Missing "Insurance Claim (C)" as transition (prompt starts with C  CR).
  - AP always sequential, ignores "if amount surpasses threshold" (should be conditional/skip possible).
  - No explicit handling for "once paid, notification sent, claim closed" as enforced path.
- **Unclear/Redundant Elements**: Extra `print` statements irrelevant. Place names inconsistent ("After_C Registration" vs. "Paid"). Optional save commented but unused. Explanation admits vagueness ("depends on how the Petri net is used")—admits non-deterministic flaws.
- **Markings Correct but Trivial**: im/final correctly defined/syntax-valid, but irrelevant given broken net.
- **Minor Issues**: No `net.places.add()` explicit (though `.place()` may imply), but fails anyway. No example-style verification/removal.

Nearly flawless requires runnable, correct API, precise loop logic (e.g., control places with initial tokens for bounded repeats or choice via disjoint enabling). This is amateurish/inoperable—low score despite basic sequence attempt.
