**10.0**

The response excels across all tasks with precise calculations (lead times accurate to the minute, verified against timestamps), correct identification of problematic cases (2002, 2003, 2005 as outliers >1 day vs. <2 hours baseline), and rigorous attribute analysis (strong correlations for complexity and request loops; nuanced dismissal of region/adjuster after controls; novel insight on Manager_Bill vs. Ann). Root causes are evidenced tabularly without overclaim. Explanations are causally sound (e.g., loops compound waits empirically). Mitigations are targeted, prioritized (quick-wins table), and feasible (e.g., checklists, routing, SLAs). No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws; structure enhances clarity; exceeds prompt via implementation plan.
