**9.2**

### Explanation of Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (justifying high score)**: 
  - Correctly identifies *exactly* the violating cases (2, 3, 5) and clears 1 and 4—no misses or false positives.
  - Sequences accurately transcribed for each case.
  - Violations logically tied to description (e.g., Case 2 correctly flags Package before Authorize; Case 5 correctly flags missing Package; Case 3 flags key issues).
  - Clear structure: per-case breakdown + summary. Interprets ambiguities conservatively/straightforwardly (e.g., mandatory steps in "expected flow").
  - Concise, no fluff.

- **Weaknesses/Deductions (strict/hypercritical—minor issues compound)**:
  - **Minor inaccuracy in phrasing (Case 3, -0.4)**: " 'Authorize payment' should not occur before 'Cancel order'." This is imprecise/logically flawed. Normative implies *no* Authorize in cancel path (directly Check  Cancel if insufficient; Authorize only post-Check in sufficient path, before packaging). Phrasing focuses on *ordering relative to Cancel* rather than *conditional absence*, risking misinterpretation (e.g., implies Authorize *after* Cancel might be OK, which it's not). Better: "Authorize payment should not occur at all in cancellation path."
  - **Incomplete violation listing (Case 3, -0.2)**: Flags Authorize-before-Cancel and Ship-after-Cancel, but misses/ignores Ship *without* prior Package (description: "Ship order" only after packaging). Multiplies existing issues but compounds under-specification.
  - **Lack of direct textual references (-0.1)**: Task requires "referencing the textual description." Case 1/2/4/5 implicitly OK ("according to normative process"), but Case 3 has *zero* explicit tie-in (no quote/phrase like "directly proceed to Cancel" or "never after cancellation"). Weaker than "nearly flawless."
  - **Minor unclarity/redundancy (-0.1)**: Summary repeats Case 3 phrasing flaw; no explicit note on inventory inference (e.g., fulfillment activities imply sufficient inventory path, justifying Package/Ship mandates).

Nearly flawless (precise IDs/explanations), but phrasing inaccuracy + incompleteness + sparse referencing prevent 10.0. Equivalent to A- under utmost strictness.
