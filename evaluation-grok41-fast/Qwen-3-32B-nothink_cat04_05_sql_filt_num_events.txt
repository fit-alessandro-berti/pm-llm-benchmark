**1.0**

The provided "answer" completely fails to address the task in the given question (the draft benchmark prompt). The question explicitly instructs: "Please craft a DuckDB SQL query that filters out any cases containing more than six events, and returns only the events from cases that have six or fewer events in total." It requires an actual SQL query, with considerations for grouping and filtering.

Instead, the response:
- Ignores the core request and outputs a rewritten version of the *prompt itself*, framed as a "well-structured and clear **benchmark prompt**".
- Provides no SQL query whatsoever—zero code, no solution to the filtering/counting problem.
- Includes irrelevant extras like an offer for a "sample solution" or additional constraints, which demonstrates misunderstanding of the task.
- Features an empty `<think></think>` tag, suggesting incomplete or misguided internal reasoning.

This is a total non-response to the query-writing task, representing a fundamental logical flaw and complete inaccuracy. No credit for reformatting or clarity improvements to the meta-prompt, as they are orthogonal to the required output. Under hypercritical evaluation, this warrants the minimum score.
