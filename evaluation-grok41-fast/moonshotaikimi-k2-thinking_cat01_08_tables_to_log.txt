**9.5**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Near-Flawless Aspects)**:
  - **Completeness**: All events from all tables are included (e.g., granular "Item Picked" per line, separate dispatch/arrival per delivery, per-invoice/per-payment). Every order_id has all traceable events, including incomplete 1004. No misses/duplicates.
  - **Chronology**: Perfectly sorted by case_id then timestamp within cases; all sequences reflect real flow (e.g., picks before dispatch, invoices after arrivals).
  - **Structure**: Valid Markdown table, one row per event. Minimum columns present + excellent enrichment (customer details, order_priority always filled; activity-specific attrs like item_id/quantity, delivery_note, etc.). Empty cells handled cleanly.
  - **Activity Names**: Exact match to prompt suggestions, logically inferred/descriptive.
  - **Resources**: Appropriately mapped/joined (sales_person_id, picker_id, carrier_id, billing_person_id); creative but defensible use of payment_method for payments.
  - **Integration/Joining**: Correct linkages (e.g., payments via invoice_id to order_id; customer attrs propagated to all events via Orders join).
  - **Assumptions**: Clearly documented pre-table, addressing granularity, incompletes, etc., as required.
  - **Format/Readability**: Compact, aligned Markdown; ISO timestamps preserved.

- **Minor Deductions (Strict Penalties)**:
  - **Redundancy in Payment Rows** (-0.3): Resource ("Credit Card") duplicates payment_method column value. Unnecessary, though harmless; bloats slightly without adding value.
  - **Missing carrier_id Column** (-0.1): Delivery events use resource for carrier_id, but no dedicated column (unlike delivery_id/note). Inconsistent with other event-types' attribute patterns (e.g., item_id/quantity paired); could confuse if resource repurposed.
  - **No Resource Name Lookup** (-0.1): Resources table provided but unused (e.g., "SP-001" vs. "Alice Brown"). Prompt recommends "user, department, or system entity" (human-readable implied); IDs alone are functional but less "descriptive."
  - **Table Width/UX** (-0.0): 17 columns wide but renders fine; no penalty as structured.

Nearly flawless execution—only nitpicks prevent 10.0. No factual errors, logical flaws, or unclarities in final output.
