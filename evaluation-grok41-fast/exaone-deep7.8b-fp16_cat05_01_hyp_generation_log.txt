**6.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting Higher Score):**
  - **Anomaly Identification (Flawless, 10/10):** Precisely pinpoints all key deviations in cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 (e.g., missing prerequisites like Credit Check/Validate Stock in 1002; Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment/Validate Stock in 1003; immediate Payment and Issue Invoice before Ship Goods in 1004). Implicitly treats 1001 as normal. No misses or fabrications; directly tied to timestamps/activities.
  - **Hypotheses (Excellent, 9/10):** Directly addresses prompt examples (system errors, policy violations, training/resource issues). Specific per case (e.g., manual overrides, workflow bugs) and generalized well (e.g., resource errors). Logical and plausible.
  - **Structure & Clarity (Strong, 9/10):** Clean sections, bullet points, per-case breakdown. Final recommendations extend to hypotheses (e.g., audit resources table).
  - **Relevance to Hypotheses (Good, 8/10):** Queries target process deviations (out-of-order, missing steps), which probe system/policy errors. Mentions resources/orders indirectly.

- **Critical Flaws (Dragging to 6.0):**
  - **SQL Queries (Poor, 3/10 – Major Penalty):** Central to prompt, but **fatally broken and non-executable in PostgreSQL**:
    | Query | Issues |
    |-------|--------|
    | 1 (Out-of-Order) | `step_mapping` CTE selects **only** `step_number` (no `case_id`, `event_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`). `ordered_events` references missing columns  **syntax error**. LAG logic sound, but unusable. |
    | 2 (Incomplete Sequences) | Minor: Works, but overly simplistic (assumes exactly 7 *distinct* activities; ignores order/duplicates). Doesn't investigate hypotheses deeply (e.g., no resource join). |
    | 3 (No Prerequisites) | Same CTE errors as Query 1. Subquery CASE ambiguously references outer `activity` (correlated but unaliased/unclear; fails hygiene). Only checks *immediate* prior step (misses chained skips, e.g., step 5 without step 3). **Syntax error**. |
    - No joins to `orders`/`resources` **in queries** (prompt allows "possibly"; recommendations mention but don't deliver SQL). Misses hypothesis probes (e.g., `JOIN resources ON resource` for policy violations; `JOIN orders` for high-value skips).
    - Redundant CTEs (LAG unused in Query 3). Inconsistent (Query 3 reuses broken pattern).
  - **Logical Gaps (Minor but Penalized):** Query 2 flags incompletes but ignores *order* (e.g., 1001 complete but ordered). No queries for timestamps/resources/additional_info (e.g., low credit_score with skips). Over-relies on step mapping without handling unknown activities.
  - **Minor Unclarities:** "Out-of-Order Steps" phrasing sometimes loose (e.g., 1003 Issue Invoice is after Ship Goods but before Confirm – correct but could specify chain).

- **Overall:** Near-perfect analysis/hypotheses (deserves 9+), but **broken SQL is a core failure** (prompt demands "relevant SQL queries... to investigate"). Strict policy: major inaccuracies (non-runnable code) warrant significant deduction. 6.0 balances excellence in content with execution flaws; flawless SQL would be 9.5+.
