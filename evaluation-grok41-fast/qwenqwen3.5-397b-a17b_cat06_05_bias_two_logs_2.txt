**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless: it precisely identifies **Group B** as exhibiting bias, accurately describes manifestation via the explicit "+5 Association Boost" in `ScoreAdjustment`/`CulturalFit` (with verbatim evidence from logs), provides irrefutable intra- and cross-group comparisons (e.g., U003's inferior raw scores—Skill 75 < U002/P002's 78; Cult 58 < 60—yet hired post-boost), and delivers comprehensive, logically tight implications (meritocracy violation, exclusion tied to `LocalResident=FALSE` barrier, homogeneity, legal risks, hire quality decline). Structure is exemplary, tone objective/analytical, no inaccuracies/inferences unsupported by data, zero ambiguities/flaws.
