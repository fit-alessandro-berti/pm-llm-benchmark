**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies (9.8/10)**: Precisely identifies the core contradiction (noncoexistence(E,C) + existence(C)  ¬E, banning E despite intended flow). Correctly notes redundancy of responded_existence, flow violation, and permissive precedence allowing undesired paths (e.g., RC). No logical flaws; directly undermines business logic without extraneous claims.
- **Hypotheses (9.7/10)**: All four are plausible, tied to anomalies/model (e.g., misinterpretation of E as rejection, policy fast-tracks, mining errors, skipping pressure). Mirrors prompt examples; creative yet grounded. Minor: Hypothesis 4 slightly overlaps 2 but distinct.
- **SQL Approaches (8.9/10)**: Excellent coverage of prompt examples (E+C coexist via GROUP BY HAVING=2; closed w/o E; E w/o A via correct LEFT JOIN detecting absence). Additional queries (immediate RC skip via LAG; no C via LEFT JOIN) directly verify model violations/precedence weakness. Ties to adjusters (E w/o A; resource check). **Penalties**: (1) Specialization mismatch query flawed—`a.specialization != c.claim_type` always true due to schema mismatch ("home"  "home_insurance"), rendering it useless/inaccurate (-0.6). (2) Resource `NOT LIKE '%adjuster%'` assumes unstated naming (-0.2). (3) E w/o A returns duplicate claim_id if multiple E (-0.1, stylistic). (4) No explicit init/precedence order checks (e.g., min(timestamp) activity'R'; C w/o prior R via NOT EXISTS timestamp<) despite model having them (-0.2). Core queries flawless/targeted.
- **Overall Structure/Independence (10/10)**: Matches prompt exactly; no hints leaked; concise, independent presentation. Ignores think tag per instructions.
- **Final Adjustments**: 0.1 deduction for extras overshadowing pure model focus; totals 9.2 (very high but not flawless due to SQL inaccuracies).
