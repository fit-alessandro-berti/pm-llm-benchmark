**7.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**:
  - Correctly identifies violating cases: 2, 3, and 5 (with 1 and 4 clean). This is flawless—core task #1 nailed.
  - Case 1 and 4 explanations accurate and concise.
  - Case 2 violation precisely pinned ("Package items" before "Authorize payment"), directly referencing normative constraint.
  - Case 5 violation correctly identified (skipping "Package items" before "Ship order"), matching textual requirement.
  - Overall structure logical (per-case breakdown + summary), references description well, interprets no major ambiguities incorrectly.

- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Factual inaccuracy in Case 3 summary**: States "authorizing payment *after* canceling an order"—this reverses the actual log sequence (Authorize at 09:40, Cancel at 10:00). This is a clear misrepresentation of the event log, not just phrasing; it's logically flawed and could mislead. Deduct 1.5 points.
  - **Explanation unclarity/logical flaw in Case 3 detailed**: Describes auth "before canceling" correctly but explains illogic as "once an order is canceled, there's no point in *proceeding* with payment authorization"—this implies post-cancel auth (wrong) and ignores key violation that auth shouldn't occur *at all* in cancel path (should be Check  Cancel directly). Misses explicit "Authorize only after Check and *before packaging*" (no packaging here) and path branching. Awkward/muddled. Deduct 1.0 point.
  - **Minor logical flaw**: Case 5 called "similar to Case 2" (Package-too-early vs. Package-missing)—not similar; superficial comparison shows shallow analysis. Deduct 0.3.
  - **Unprofessional ending**: "I hope it is correct." Undermines authority, shows doubt; inappropriate for task. Deduct 0.2.
  
- **Overall**: ~85% flawless (perfect ID, good refs), but inaccuracies/unclarities in key violation (Case 3, multi-issue) prevent "nearly flawless." Strict policy demands significant penalty for *any* issues—caps at 7.0. No higher without zero flaws.
