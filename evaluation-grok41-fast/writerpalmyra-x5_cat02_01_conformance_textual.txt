**8.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**: Correctly identifies **exact violating cases (2, 3, 5)** and compliant ones (1, 4)—no errors here. Excellent structure with clear sections, table summary, bullet-point explanations, and direct references to normative text (e.g., quotes on illogical fulfillment post-cancel, packaging pre-ship). Final answer concise and task-compliant. Logical flow in most analyses solid; interpretations reasonable overall.
- **Inaccuracies/Unclarities (major deductions)**:
  - **Case 3 incomplete/misleading**: Flags *only* "Ship after Cancel" (correct) but misses *two explicit violations*: (1) No "Package items" at all before "Ship order" (norm explicitly requires "only after items properly packaged"; applies regardless of cancel). (2) "Authorize payment" before "Cancel order" deviates from mutually exclusive paths ("if sufficient  Auth path; if not  *directly* to Cancel"—doing Auth then Cancel implies authorizing when insufficient, violating "auth only makes sense once sufficiency known"). Phrases like "may imply business exception" or "possibly premature... business decision" *introduce false ambiguity*, contradicting normative's clear branching. Hypercritical flaw: softens/ignores clear deviations, under-explains violations.
- **Logical flaws/minor issues (further deductions)**:
  - Core constraints #1 overstates "immediately after Receive" (norm says "next logical step" and "before decisions"—not strictly immediate; timestamps allow gaps without other activities, but wording adds unsupported rigidity).
  - Case 2 good, but doesn't note secondary issue: "Ship order" follows "Authorize" *directly* post-Package misordering (though primary Package-before-Auth caught).
  - Inconsistent depth: Case 5 perfectly notes missing Package; Case 3 ignores it despite identical "Ship without Package" logic.
  - No mention of universal rules holding (e.g., all Check after Receive, Close final)—minor omission, but task requires comprehensive deviation ID.
- **Overall**: Nearly flawless structure/content (90%+ alignment), but Case 3's incompleteness + hedging = significant accuracy gap (not "resolving ambiguities as best..."). Drops from 9.5+ to 8.0 under "even minor issues significantly lower" + "hypercritical" mandate. Flawless would catch *all* violations per constraints (e.g., Case 3: Auth-then-Cancel, no-Package, Ship-post-Cancel).
