**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (why not <4.0)**: Perfect Python dictionary format (tuples of tuples, valid keys/values, syntactically executable). Includes a representative subset of ~17 pairs mixing direct (9), indirect (6), and long-span (2), correctly assuming a logical linear order (SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS) consistent with supply chain semantics. Units consistent (seconds), comments provide useful breakdowns, and variability generally increases with span (reasonable intent). Covers "complexity" via multi-step pairs.
- **Major Flaws (severe deductions)**:
  - **Logical inconsistency in time estimates (fatal, -3.0)**: Averages do **not** accumulate additively as required by the temporal profile definition (for linear traces, avg(A,C)  avg(A,B) + avg(B,C); std compounds). Examples:
    | Pair | Provided Avg (days) | Expected Sum from Directs (days) | Discrepancy |
    |------|---------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|
    | SS-QI | 8 | ~7.8 (0.5+7+0.08) | Minor OK |
    | SS-CA | **16** | ~7.9 (+0.04) | **Double**, arbitrary |
    | OP-PT | **14** | ~7.2 (+0.04+0.125) | **Double** |
    | RC-PK | **14** | ~0.3 (+0.04+0.125+0.04) | **Insanely inflated** |
    | SS-DT | **30** | ~10.8 | **Triple**, ignores path sums |
    Std devs also fail to compound realistically (e.g., SS-DT std=6d vs. expected sum vars >>10d).
  - **Unrealistic scales for scenario (-1.5)**: Direct chain total SSDT ~11 days (SSAS ~13 days) is absurd for "complex global supply chain... high-tech electronics" (realistic: procurement/lead times 4-12 weeks, assembly/testing days-weeks, total months). OP-RC=7d too short for global high-tech components; contrasts with semi-realistic indirects (30d), amplifying inconsistency.
  - **Incomplete representation (-0.8)**: "Representative subset" OK, but omits key pairs (e.g., SSPT, SSAS, RCAS, CADT) for fuller complexity; selected indirects feel cherry-picked/arbitrary rather than systematic (e.g., no mid-chain like QIPK).
  - **Minor issues (-0.5)**: Comments claim "balances realism" but don't justify jumps (e.g., SS-CA "2 weeks + variability" ignores path). No evidence of std calculation (e.g., not (² + ²)). Extra text ("Key Observations") verbose but not penalized per instructions.
- **Overall**: Structurally sound but undermined by core inaccuracies/logical flaws violating model definition. Not "nearly flawless" (requires perfect internal consistency + realism). 10.0 impossible; 4.2 reflects solid effort with critical failures.
