**8.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: Code is syntactically perfect, uses pm4py correctly, adds all places/transitions/arcs properly, defines im/fm exactly as required, includes all mentioned activities except arguably minor ones, models the core linear sequence flawlessly (CRDVFCCAAPPNCL), captures loops for RDS and II as non-deterministic choices (standard for unlabeled Petri nets without guards/colors/inhibitors), initial/final markings precise, extra verification prints harmless and helpful. Explanation clear and accurate for intended model. Accepting net semantics satisfied (final marking reachable via valid paths).
- **Major Deductions (-1.8 total)**:
  - **Missing "Insurance Claim (C)" transition ( -0.8 )**: Scenario explicitly starts with bolded **Insurance Claim (C)** as the first activity ("A customer files an **Insurance Claim (C)**, after which..."), listed parallel to others. Net skips it (p_start  CR directly). p_start vaguely "New claim arrival" doesn't substitute; logical flaw, incomplete coverage of "these activities."
  - **AP not conditional ( -0.5 )**: "Approval (AP): The claim must be approved... *if* the amount surpasses a certain threshold." Clear conditional ("if"), implying XOR split after CA (AP  P *or* CA  P bypass). Net forces mandatory AP (p_ca_done  AP  P). No choice modeled; violates "logical sequence."
  - **II loop allows illogical paths ( -0.5 )**: II  p_dv_done places token where RDS *or* FC choosable. Enables invalid sequence (e.g., FC  II  RDS  re-DV), illogical during fraud phase (DV already complete). RDS choice shouldn't be accessible post-II. Requires separate p_pre_fc (e.g., p_dv_done  RDS/*or*/p_pre_fc  FC; II  p_pre_fc). Subtle but critical logical flaw in "complex" scenario emphasizing loops.
- **Minor Deductions (-0.0 net, as balanced)**:
  - Transition labels full ("Claim Registration") vs. short activity names ("CR"); minor mismatch to "labeled with the activity names" (abbreviations in parens), but constructor valid and example uses descriptive.
  - RDS  p_cr_done mildly odd ("re-registered"?), but token skips CR firing (correct behavior).
  - Extra prints/verification; unnecessary but non-violating.
  - No multi-token/resources; fine for sequential single-case model.

Nearly flawless structurally/semantically (9+ territory), but 3 logical inaccuracies (missing activity, conditional ignored, loop underspecified) prevent 9.5+. Resolves to 8.2 under utmost strictness.
