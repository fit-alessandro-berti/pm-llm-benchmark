The provided answer is an exceptionally accurate, comprehensive, and precise textual description of the entire three-part figure. It correctly captures:
- **a)** All tasks, flows, performers, optional loops, channels (Order system and HIS), and numbered message links in the interaction/process view.
- **b)** The exact class diagram structure, including "requires" relationship and cardinalities (1..1 for Lab visit to 1..* for Lab test).
- **c)** The performative table details verbatim (time, channel, sender/receiver names, action "Create", content, scope "Private", direction "OUT").

No errors, omissions, or extraneous details—it's a perfect match to the image.
