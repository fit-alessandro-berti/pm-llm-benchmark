**9.5**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (justifying high score)**: 
  - Correctly identifies all violating cases (2, 3, 5) and compliant ones (1, 4) with no misses or false positives. Matches task precisely.
  - Per-case analysis is structured, comprehensive, and directly references the description's language (e.g., quotes constraints accurately for Case 2, cites "never after a cancellation" for Case 3).
  - Explanations are logical, evidence-based, and interpret ambiguities conservatively as instructed (e.g., no Authorize in insufficient path; Package mandatory before Ship).
  - Covers all key violations: wrong order in Case 2 (Package before Authorize), path mixing/Ship after Cancel in Case 3, missing Package in Case 5.
  - Summary is concise and task-aligned. No unclarities in structure or logic; timestamps implicitly respected as sequential.

- **Minor Inaccuracies/Flaws (deducting 0.5)**:
  - Case 3: Labels "authorization" as an example of "intermediate fulfillment steps." Description explicitly limits "fulfillment" to "packaging or shipping" ("activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)"); Authorize is a prior payment/decision step, not fulfillment. This mislabels it, even if the broader point (no such steps in insufficient path) holds. Hypercritical deduction for imprecise terminology.
  - No other issues: No logical flaws (e.g., Case 5's missing Package correctly flagged as skipping required prep per "items must be prepared before shipped"); no omissions; no overinterpretation.

Nearly flawless—exceptional analysis—but strict policy demands deduction for the phrasing inaccuracy.
