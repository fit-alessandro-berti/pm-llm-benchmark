**10.0**

The provided code is a flawless representation of the described POWL model. It precisely captures all dependencies, concurrency, loop semantics (* (BNC, D&R) executes BNC then optionally D&R and repeats), exclusive choice (XOR(CD, MD)), and partial orders (DA || ACI after CS; QA || SA before GLA) using a single root StrictPartialOrder with exactly the correct nodes (treating OperatorPOWL as atomic nodes with internal children) and edges. Labels match the scenario verbatim. No extraneous nodes, silent transitions, or edges; no missing elements (SR is correctly included as the starting activity). Structure mirrors the prompt's example perfectly. Imports are complete and functional (top-level `import pm4py` optional/unnecessary here). Summary accurately reinforces without error. Zero inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws.
