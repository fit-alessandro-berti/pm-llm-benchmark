**4.0**

The final POWL model uses correct POWL classes (StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL with LOOP/XOR, Transition, SilentTransition), proper imports, syntactically valid code, and a linear partial order matching the sequential nature (no unneeded concurrency). It correctly identifies and models: (1) initial sequence ORMSQSAS, (2) optional LB via XOR(LB, skip), (3) testing loop *(TST, RT) which accurately generates observed TST(+ (RT TST)*) traces ending in TST, and (4) optional IQC phase via XOR around the loop to handle Case 4 skip.

However, major logical flaws prevent it from representing the process:
- **IQC-AS loop semantics mismatch**: *(IQC, AS) generates traces IQC(+ (AS IQC)*), always ending after IQC (decision/exit only post-A=IQC). Observed traces after initial AS end after AS (e.g., Case 1/2: IQC AS; Case 3: IQC IQC AS IQC AS). Cannot generate IQC AS (forces IQC AS IQC minimum for "one iteration") or consecutive IQC (after IQC: exit or ASIQC, never IQCIQC).
- **Cannot replay traces**: Case 1/2 (AS IQC AS TST) impossible (skipAS TST; IQC exitAS IQC TST; nextAS IQC AS IQC TST extra IQC). Case 3 impossible (consecutive IQC). Only Case 4 works.
- **Unclear handling of multiple AS/IQC**: Treats AS in loop1 separately from initial AS but fails to produce valid interleavings.

These are critical inaccuracies in control-flow modeling, violating trace fidelity. Minor: no transitivity enforcement issues noted, but no concurrency/parallelism exploited despite PO capability. Not nearly flawless.
