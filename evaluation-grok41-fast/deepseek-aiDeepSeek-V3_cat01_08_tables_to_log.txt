**10.0**

This answer is flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It fully complies with all requirements:

- **Completeness**: All events from all tables are included for every order_id (1001–1005). Missing data (e.g., no delivery/invoice/payment for 1004) is correctly handled by omitting non-existent events without fabrication.
- **Case ID**: Correctly uses `order_id`.
- **Activities**: Logically derived and consistent ("Order Created", "Items Picked" per line item with distinct timestamps/pickers, "Order Dispatched"/"Order Arrived" per delivery record, "Invoice Issued" per invoice, "Payment Received" per payment). Matches prompt examples precisely.
- **Timestamps**: Exact matches from source tables; no approximations or inventions.
- **Chronological order**: Perfect within each case (verified timestamp-by-timestamp across all rows). Grouped by case ID (standard for event log presentation), with intra-case sorting correct.
- **Resources**: Appropriately assigned from source tables (sales_person_id, picker_id, carrier_id, billing_person_id); N/A for payments where no data exists. Uses IDs correctly (Resources table optional; no mandate to resolve to names).
- **Attributes**: Relevant and non-redundant (e.g., item/quantity for pickings, delivery_id for deliveries, amounts/methods for financials). Optional tables (Products/Resources) not integrated, as not required.
- **Linking**: Perfect joins via order_id  invoice_id  payment_id; handles multiples (e.g., 1002's split deliveries/invoices/payments).
- **Output**: Clean Markdown table; assumptions explicitly documented, addressing potential ambiguities (e.g., multiples, N/A resources).
- **No inaccuracies/logical flaws**: All data traces back exactly; no summarization errors (per-item pickings meaningful due to distinct times/resources); process flow realistic (e.g., picking precedes dispatch).

No minor issues: formatting consistent, no extraneous data, no omissions, no anachronisms. Ready for process mining (e.g., import to ProM/Discovery).
