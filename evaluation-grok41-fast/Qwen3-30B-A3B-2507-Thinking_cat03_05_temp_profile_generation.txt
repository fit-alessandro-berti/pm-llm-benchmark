**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (pushing toward high score)**:
  - **Format perfection (flawless)**: Exact Python dictionary structure with tuple keys (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`) and value tuples `(avg, sd)` in seconds. Clean, executable code block.
  - **Content coverage (excellent)**: 15 pairs as a "representative subset," mixing 9 consecutive + 6 non-consecutive (multi-step spans like `('SS', 'RC')`, `('OP', 'WS')`), demonstrating required complexity. All 10 activities included; respects strict forward order (no backward or implausible pairs like `('AS', 'SS')`).
  - **Realism & estimation (strong)**: Times/SDs plausibly estimated from supply chain knowledge (e.g., long `OPRC` 30d/high SD for lead times; short/low-SD admin like `SSOP`; variable storage `PKWS`). SDs proportionally scaled (10-50% of avg, higher for uncertain steps). No prompt numbers used—pure LLM estimation.
  - **Added value (bonus, no penalty)**: Comments in dict, detailed rationale with process logic/variability explanations enhance clarity without violating prompt.
  - **Overall completeness**: Captures "eventually follow each other" via traces; ignores impossible pairs logically.

- **Flaws (strict deductions, preventing 10.0)**:
  - **Critical logical inconsistency (major deduction: -1.5)**: Temporal profiles from sequential traces **must** satisfy additivity: `avg(A,C) = avg(A,B) + avg(B,C)` exactly (since `time(AC) = time(AB) + time(BC)` per trace, so averages sum). Violations:
    | Chain | Sum of provided avgs (days) | Provided non-consec avg (days) | Error |
    |-------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|-------|
    | SSOP + OPRC  SSRC | 1 + 30 = 31 | 32 | +1d (minor but violates exactly) |
    | OPRC + RCQI + QICA + CAPT + PTPK + PKWS  OPWS | 30+2+3+5+1+15 = **56** | **45** | -11d (~20%) |
    | QICA + CAPT + PTPK + PKWS + WSDT  QIDT | 3+5+1+15+7 = **31** | **20** | -11d (~35%) |
    | RCQI + ... + WSDT  RCDT | 2+3+5+1+15+7 = **33** | **28** | -5d (~15%) |
    | CAPT + PTPK + PKWS  CAWS | 5+1+15 = **21** | **27** | +6d (ok-ish, but inconsistent direction) |
    These are **mathematical inaccuracies** in the model—cannot represent real logs from the described sequential process ("each execution involves the following activities"). Not "estimates"; breaks core definition. (Even with trace variants, provided consecutives imply full chain; subset must be internally consistent.)
  - **Minor unclarities/incompleteness (-0.3)**: Rationale speculates unprompted details (e.g., "defects may require rework")—accurate but extraneous. No coverage of potential variants despite "multiple executions." Cumulative logic mentioned but not enforced.
  
- **Score calculation**: Base 10.0 for format/content  -1.5 for additivity violations (core logical flaw, not ignorable as "estimates")  -0.3 minor  **8.2**. Very strong (award-worthy), but "not nearly flawless" per strict criteria—flaws are evident, not trivial rounding.
