**7.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Anomalies (9.5/10):** Precisely identifies the core contradictions—noncoexistence of E/C (direct conflict with sequential flow) and weak precedence for C (allows skipping A/E/P/N). No fluff, directly undermines intended logic. Minor deduction for not explicitly noting absence of other precedences (e.g., no AE enforcement beyond responded_existence ambiguity), but model-focused and complete.
- **Hypotheses (9.0/10):** Excellent match to prompt examples (misinterpretation, incremental changes, technical issues, quick-handling pressure). Varied, plausible, business-relevant. Slight stretch on "automation pressure" tying loosely to permissive constraints (model is more restrictive than permissive).
- **SQL Verification (5.0/10):** Queries 1,3,4,5 are accurate, efficient, and directly probe anomalies (e.g., C w/o E/P, C before A, E w/o prior A). **Critical flaw in Query 2:** Labeled for "coexistence of E and C" (key to noncoexistence anomaly), but SQL uses `WHERE activity IN ('E', 'C')` which finds claims with *E OR C*, not *both*. This fails to verify coexistence (e.g., COUNT could be high from solo-E or solo-C claims, proving nothing about model's contradiction). Requires subqueries/EXISTS for both activities. No aggregation/GROUP BY issues noted, but this logical/SQL inaccuracy tanks the section—central to task, not minor.
- **Overall Structure/Clarity (9.0/10):** Clean sections, no hints from prompt, independent presentation. Concise yet comprehensive.
- **Total:** Strong content undermined by pivotal SQL error (hypercritical penalty: -3.0 equivalent). Nearly flawless would require perfect SQL; this is very good but flawed.
