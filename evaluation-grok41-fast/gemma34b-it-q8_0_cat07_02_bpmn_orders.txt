**6.2/10.0**

### Breakdown:
- **Accuracy (3.5/4)**: Mostly identifies correct boxes and sections (e.g., "Monday Morning," "Add customer to database," "Material Compensation Subprocess," "Return material"). However, key errors: misinterprets subprocess as customer returns (it's likely internal/supplier material returns for compensation); "invoiced goods dispatched" not in diagram; vague on decisions/loops (e.g., diamonds like "Check if customer already in database").
- **Completeness (1.5/3)**: Covers high-level structure and major steps but skips flows/arrows (e.g., loops from "Monday Morning," subprocess connections to canceling), decision outcomes, and minor elements (e.g., "Sales Order," "Product Complete" precursors). Superficial on interactions.
- **Clarity & Structure (1.2/3)**: Well-organized with sections/bullets; readable and engaging. Minor fluff (e.g., offer to "delve deeper") but no jargon issues.

**Why not higher?** Factual misreads reduce trust (e.g., customer vs. material focus); misses ~30-40% of diagram details for full analysis. Solid effort for casual summary, but weak for precise grading/description task.
