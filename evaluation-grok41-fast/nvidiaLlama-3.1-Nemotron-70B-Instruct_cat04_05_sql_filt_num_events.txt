**8.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**:
  - The **query is flawless**: Correctly uses CTE to compute event counts per `case_id`, applies `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to precisely match the requirement ("six or fewer", i.e., exclude only >6). INNER JOIN efficiently retrieves all events (`el.*`) for qualifying cases. `ORDER BY` is a nice, logical addition for readability (though not required). Fully standard SQL, works perfectly in DuckDB, considers grouping/filtering as specified.
  - **Explanation text is strong**: Breakdown accurately describes CTE purpose, grouping, HAVING logic, join, and output. Clear, structured, educational.

- **Major Deduction (-2.0 points)**:
  - **Example is factually inaccurate and logically flawed** (not minor—actively misleading):
    - Input data shows **exactly 6 events for case_id 2** (Start, Task X, Task Y, Task Z, End, Review—verifiable row count).
    - Query's `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` **would include case 2**.
    - Yet, claimed "Output after running the query" **excludes case 2 entirely**, which is impossible—running the provided query on the provided input would output case 2's 6 events (sorted between case 1 and 3).
    - Note explicitly lies: "Case ID 2 is excluded because it contains more than six events" (false; it has exactly 6, not >6).
  - This creates a contradiction: output  query result on input data. Demonstrates lack of verification (e.g., didn't test or recount). Confuses readers, implies wrong logic (e.g., misread <=6 as <6), undermines trust in explanation. In a benchmark, this fails "correctness" checks.

- **Minor issues (no further deduction, as hyper-minor)**:
  - `event_count` aliased but unused (harmless optimization opportunity missed, but irrelevant).
  - Ordering unrequested (bonus, not flaw).
  - No performance notes for large tables (e.g., CTE materialization in DuckDB), but prompt doesn't require.

Nearly flawless query/explanation text merits 10, but example inaccuracy (core to "illustrative" section) demands significant penalty per instructions. Equivalent to submitting correct code with wrong test results. 8.0 reflects "very good but critically flawed in validation/demo."
