**3.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Demonstrates conceptual understanding of Petri net structure for the process (correct main sequence CRDVFCCA(AP?)PNCL; proper loop modeling via split outputs from DV/FC to rework/investigate places, with RDS/II feeding back to pre-loop inputs for multiple iterations; optional AP via explicit + silent transition split; omits 'C' transition correctly as external trigger, starting from 'start' place for new claim; uses PM4Py APIs accurately in initial code snippet).
- **Major Flaws (severe deductions)**:
  - **Incomplete and non-executable code**: Core arcs (e.g., `fc_success`CA, CA`ca_output`, `ca_output`AP/skip_ap, AP/skip_ap`ap_output`, `ap_output`Payment input place, Payment`payment`Notification, etc.) are garbled/missing ("petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_success_, ca_, net)_success_..." is syntax-broken repetition). No complete flow to `closed`.
  - **Missing required elements**: No `im = Marking({start: 1})` or `fm = Marking({closed: 1})` definitions/print/assignment—explicitly required by task. No verification of accepting net construction (e.g., no final assembly check).
  - **Syntax/logical errors**: Import fragments later use wrong aliases (e.g., `petrinet.obj`, `petrinet.utils`); repeated "Due space constraints" placeholders instead of code; II loop-back to `dv_success` works nondeterministically but risks re-triggering DV unintentionally (minor logical unclarity, as post-II should strictly re-enter FC input only).
  - **Unclear/incoherent presentation**: Code interrupted by excuses ("Due time constraints", "Corrected lines"), ending in massive repetitive hallucinated text (e.g., endless "achieving desired objectives..."). Final "code" blocks are empty/broken stubs—not a valid solution.
  - **Minor issues compounding**: Place before Payment is `ap_output` (direct input to `pay`), but code snippet has `payment` place post-pay without full connections; no `net.places.add()` for all (some listed but not exhaustive); silent transition `label=None` assumed valid but untested in PM4Py context.
- **Overall**: Intent is ~70% correct, but deliverable is unusable/broken (fails to run, misses key outputs). Strict penalty for non-flawless execution: not even passing as complete answer. Equivalent to a sketched diagram without working implementation.
