**8.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is **excellent in structure, coverage, and adherence to most prompt criteria**, earning a high score through comprehensive, logical organization (11 sections mirroring process flow + extras like metrics/exceptions), purely open-ended phrasing, and precise targeting of missing details (e.g., hierarchies, thresholds), decision criteria (e.g., weighted tenant factors), roles (e.g., approvers/escalations), timing (e.g., timelines/bottlenecks), sequencing (implied via flows), and exceptions (e.g., gray areas, refusals). It avoids SQL entirely and stays 95%+ conceptual. Intro/closing explicitly tie back to goals. No logical flaws in question logic; all enhance understanding without leading to implementation.

**Deduction reasons (strict/minor issues compounded): -1.8 total**
- **Repeated borderline implementation probes (major recurring flaw, -1.2)**: 6+ questions violate "no implementation details" by naming/querying tools/systems, undermining "conceptual understanding only":
  | Question | Issue |
  |----------|-------|
  | Inspection: "shared spreadsheet, CRM field, or dedicated repair-tracking system?" | Direct tool enumeration. |
  | Audits: "*automated alerts* if underpriced?" | Specifies automation type. |
  | Comm: "central dashboard showing statuses?" | Names UI/tool. |
  | Comm: "*standardized templates* for emails?" | Template details = implementation. |
  | Alignment: "*standardized scripts* or *checklists*?" | Tool-like artifacts. |
  | Regional: "*standard operating procedures (SOPs)*?" | Probes documents/process artifacts. |
  These aren't SQL but cross into "how it's built/run" vs. pure concepts (e.g., better: "How do you standardize communication?").
- **Minor unclarities/over-specificity (-0.4)**: Some examples are hyper-prescriptive (e.g., Marketing's "Lowering price by 10% increases inquiries by 30%" assumes data provision; Tenant's "100% refundable deposit caps at 1.5x rent" invents policy). Slightly leading, risks biasing responses.
- **Minor bloat (-0.2)**: 50+ questions exceed "series" (prompt implies concise probing); exhaustive but risks interviewee fatigue, diluting focus.

**Why not lower?** 80%+ flawless conceptual depth; flaws are contained, not pervasive inaccuracies. **Why not 10?** Not "nearly flawless"—implementation slips are explicit prompt violations, warranting deduction even if minor per instance. Retest-worthy with tool-agnostic rephrasing (e.g., "How do you track repairs conceptually?").
