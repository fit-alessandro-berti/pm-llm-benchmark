**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (near-flawless aspects)**:
  - **Correctness of SQL logic**: All three "correct" solutions accurately identify cases with <=6 events and return qualifying events. Window function (#1) is optimally efficient for DuckDB (single pass, preserves order potential). JOIN (#2) and CTE (#3) are valid alternatives with clear tradeoffs. Incorrect "standard" approach properly debunked with precise explanation of GROUP BY error (non-aggregated columns cause SQL error in DuckDB/ANSI SQL).
  - **Completeness**: Covers prompt requirements exactly—counts per `case_id`, filters >6 out, returns events for <=6. Includes DuckDB-specific recommendation with valid performance rationale.
  - **Clarity and structure**: Excellent pedagogy—analysis, multiple idiomatic options, advantages listed, sample data + expected output for validation. Highly readable, modular.
  - **No syntax/logic errors**: All queries are executable in DuckDB, produce correct results on described data. ORDER BY is sensible (though unrequested; minor bonus for process mining context).

- **Deducted points (strict deductions for flaws)**:
  - **Column selection inaccuracy (-0.5)**: Queries hardcode `SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp` instead of `SELECT *` (or `el.*, case_summary.event_count` where applicable). Prompt specifies "at least" these columns and demands "full set of events" (all row data). If table has additional columns (e.g., `resource`, common in event logs), they are silently dropped—logical flaw in generality. Window query exacerbates by omitting them in subquery.
  - **Over-delivery relative to prompt (-0.2)**: Prompt requests **a** single "DuckDB SQL query", not 3+ options, analysis, or benchmark essay. Thoroughness is valuable but deviates; benchmark context implies explanation OK, but strict reading sees bloat/unfocused "craft a query".
  - **Unrequested ORDER BY (-0.1)**: Adds sorting (good practice, but prompt specifies none; could alter semantics if timestamps tie).
  - **Minor sample data imprecision (-0.0 2)**: case_002 lists 4 explicit events + "7 more" (=11), but parenthetically "10+"; cosmetic, not functional.

Nearly flawless (elite benchmark response), but column flaw is non-trivial inaccuracy per "full events" + "at least" schema, warranting deduction under hypercritical lens. Single perfect query with `SELECT *` would be 10.0.
