**10.0**

### Rationale
- **Accuracy (perfect)**: The description precisely matches the diagram. It correctly identifies all elements (tasks as transitions, black circles as places), the flow (initial split after "a", sync at "e", outcomes/loops from "e"), and dynamic behaviors enabled by the routing nodes (configurable as XOR/AND/OR split/join via token marking).
- **Completeness (perfect)**: Covers the process flow, loopback from "f", possible outcomes ("g"/"h" to "z"), and **every** legend element with exact definitions.
- **Clarity & Structure (excellent)**: Well-organized (sections 1-2 + summary), uses diagram labels (a-h, z), avoids errors/misinterpretations, and concisely explains Petri-net semantics without fluff.
- **Depth (excellent)**: Goes beyond surface description to explain configurability ("depending on the split rule"), synchronization, and token behavior—ideal for a workflow net analysis.

No deductions; this is a model response.
