**2.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Fatal Structural Errors (Dominant Deduction)**: The Petri net is **not accepting**. There is no firing sequence from `im` (token in `start`) to `fm` (token in `closure`) due to incorrect loop modeling:
  - `t_dv` has **two input places** (`claim_registration` and `re_document_submission`): requires tokens in **both** (AND semantics), but single token semantics make it unffirable after `t_cr`. Stuck immediately after CR.
  - `t_fc` has **two input places** (`document_verification` and `in_depth_investigation`): same AND issue; first FC never fires.
  - This is a beginner-level mistake (confusing OR-choice merge with AND-input). Breaks entire flow; net simulates incorrectly/doesn't terminate. Instant -8 points.
- **Erroneous Self-Loop at End**: `closure -> t_cl` + `t_cl -> closure` creates infinite loop on `closure`. Even if reachable (not), violates "final state" (process doesn't end). Misleading comment ("End loop to reach final marking"). -1 point.
- **Missing Conditional Logic for AP**: Scenario explicitly conditional ("**if** the amount surpasses a certain threshold"). Model forces **always** `t_ca -> t_ap -> t_p` (no branch/skip from `claim_assessment` to `t_p`). Logical flaw; doesn't match "complex" process. -1 point.
- **Minor Incompleteness**: No transition for initial "Insurance Claim (C)" (filing before CR); start directly to CR. Scenario lists C separately. -0.5 point.
- **Unclear/Superfluous Elements**: Print statements output raw sets (unreadable, useless). Transition names (`t_CR`) internal/unnecessary (labels OK). Places/arcs mostly match but tainted by errors. Explanation ignores simulation failure. -0.5 point.
- **Positives (Why Not 1.0)**: Syntax valid; imports/places/transitions/labels/im/fm correct; linear sequence (CR-DV-FC-CA-AP-P-N-CL) and loop **attempts** present; uses pm4py correctly. +1 point.

Nearly flawless requires **executable, sound, accepting net matching scenario exactly**. This fails core requirement (not accepting, wrong logic). Equivalent to broken code.
