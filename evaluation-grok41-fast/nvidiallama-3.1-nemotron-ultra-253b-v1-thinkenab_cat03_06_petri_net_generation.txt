**6.0**

The final code is mostly well-structured with correct imports, net creation, place/transition definitions (all 11 required activities/loops covered with proper labels), addition to net collections, main linear path (CCRDVFCCAAPPNCL), correct initial/final markings, and correct modeling of the FC-II loop (p6  II  p3 enables multiple FC firings non-deterministically). However, the DV-RDS loop is fundamentally broken: `petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p4, p2, net)` attempts an invalid place-to-place arc, which raises an Exception in pm4py (as `add_arc_from_to` strictly enforces placetransition). This prevents net construction, leaves a dangling p4 (token stuck post-RDS, no path to DV), and fails to model re-submissionre-verification. Symmetrically correct fix would be RDS directly from p3p2 (like II), omitting p4. This core inaccuracy (invalid net, unmodeled required loop) warrants strict deduction despite near-perfection elsewhere. Minor: arbitrary/skipped place names (e.g., p5/p7 absent) inconsequential.
