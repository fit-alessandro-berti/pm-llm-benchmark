**3.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Code Only):
- **Major Semantic Flaw in Loop (Fatal, -3.0+ penalty)**: The LOOP node sets `children[0]` = body (`SC -> XOR(TM/SPT) -> RDT`), `children[1]` = entire post-loop exit path (`(AI + NC) -> (FAS -> DDI) -> (BL + ICP + MRF)`). Per explicit definition `* (A, B)`: executes A, *then either exit or execute B then A again*. This models: after RDT, if "abnormal"  execute *all post-loop activities (AI/NC/FAS/DDI/BL/ICP/MRF)* *then repeat SC/treat/RDT*. This is logically impossible/reverse of scenario (post-loop must *not* execute on loopback; loopback skips straight to SC). No tau for empty redo path. Core process broken.
- **Incorrect Loop Entry (Major, -1.5 penalty)**: Sequence forces *always* execute loop body (SC/treat/RDT) at least once after initial XOR(CE/FBP), despite description "If abnormal [after initial test], loop commences" (implies XOR/skip to post-loop if initial normal, no SC/treat/RDT). Model generates invalid traces (e.g., always SC after FBP even if "normal").
- **Missing Activities & RDT Modeling (Major, -1.5 penalty)**: Omits FCE/FBA entirely (listed in expected set). RDT is single leaf, but description states "RDT itself is an exclusive choice ... Either FCE ... or FBA" (must be `XOR(FCE, FBA)` replacing/inside RDT leaf). 2/19 expected leaves absent; violates "models this entire complex process".
- **Minor Structural/Completeness Issues (-0.5 cumulative)**: Post-loop exit is sequenced correctly internally ((AI+NC) then (FAS->DDI) then (BL+ICP+MRF)), but misplaced in B invalidates it. Initial seq/XOR correct. No tau/guards, but unneeded if structure fit. Code syntax/parent/children perfect (runnable PM4Py).
- **Partial Credits (+1.0 cumulative)**: Captures most (17/19) activities, correct operators/labels/locations for non-loop parts, clean code with comments matching description flow superficially.

Nearly flawless requires perfect behavioral match to description/operators (traces like optional loop entry, pure repeat of body, RDT=XOR). Multiple logical flaws make invalid model; strict deduction yields 3.2.
