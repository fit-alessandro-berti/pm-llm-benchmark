**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (why not lower):**
- **Completeness**: Fully addresses all target LLM prompt goals—identifies anomalies exhaustively (control-flow, skips/repeats, roles/depts, timing, behavioral), requires case_id examples, hypothesizes root causes (bugs, fraud, etc.), proposes standalone PostgreSQL-valid SQL for validation/falsification without hints. Adds value with summary table, per-class structure, and recommendations.
- **Structure & Clarity**: Output format is precise, enforceable (numbered sections, bullets), concise yet exhaustive. SQL guidelines (readable JOINs, aliases, minimal columns, no cross-query CTEs, PostgreSQL 15+) are explicit and correct.
- **No Hints**: LLM must discover anomalies from data (e.g., case 1002/1003/1004 control-flow skips like pre-credit shipment; 1004 payment-first; potential role/timing issues) without guidance.
- **Usability**: "Ready-to-use" copy-paste block is practical; assumes conversation history has data tables.

**Flaws Deducting Points (Strict/Hypercritical—minor issues scaled down significantly):**
- **-0.4: Factual Inaccuracy in Setup**: Claims "already loaded in PostgreSQL" and "FULL read-only access" / "paste into psql/DBeaver", but data is markdown tables in chat history—LLM can't actually query a DB. This misleads slightly (LLM simulates analysis from text, generates SQL for hypothetical real DB). Minor, but "unrealistic" for text-based LLMs; could confuse less competent models into hallucinating DB access.
- **-0.2: Minor Unclarity/Overreach**: "Using ONLY the data in the tables above" is good, but "tables above" ambiguously refers to schemas/samples—full data is in prior tables (cases 1001-1004). LLM might miss nuances (e.g., resource depts via JOIN). Also, "self-contained SQL (no CTEs chained across queries)" allows single-query CTEs but phrasing is wordy/redundant.
- **-0.1: Logical Flaw in Scope**: Encourages "every type of anomaly" + "exhaustive but concise", risking verbose LLM output; no cap on anomaly classes (data has ~5-7 clear ones: control-flow in 1002/1003/1004, skips like no Validate Stock in 1003, timing reversals in 1004, potential role pushes via resources JOIN). Hypotheses/SQL "for every hypothesis" could chain excessively if LLM overgenerates.
- **-0.1: Output Rigidity**: "Summary Table of Anomaly Classes (name, short description, #cases affected)" mandates exact columns—good, but data has only 4 cases, so "#cases affected" is trivial (1-3); doesn't handle edge (e.g., 0 cases).

**Overall**: Nearly flawless (elite quality for purpose), but minor setup inaccuracy and phrasing nits prevent 10.0. Scores 9.5+ only for zero-issue perfection. This would elicit excellent LLM responses (e.g., detecting 1004 payment-before-register as fraud hypothesis, SQL for `LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)`).
