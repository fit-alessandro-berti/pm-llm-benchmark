The provided answer is nearly flawless: it precisely solves the problem with correct logic for direct succession via row-number joins, accurate time-diff filtering (>5 days using DuckDB-compatible INTERVAL), whole-case exclusion via NOT IN on DISTINCT case_ids, and returns all events (SELECT *) from non-matching cases. The step-by-step reasoning is clear and mirrors the query structure without errors. Minor extras like final ORDER BY (logical and aligns with "proper ordering") and efficient CTEs add polish without flaws. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical gaps; handles edge cases (e.g., multiple sequences per case, no matches) implicitly correct. Hypercritical review finds zero deductibles.
