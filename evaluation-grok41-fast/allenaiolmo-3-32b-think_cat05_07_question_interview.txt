**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**: 
  - Perfect adherence to open-ended format: All questions use "Can you describe...", "How do...", "What are...", avoiding yes/no or closed probes.
  - Comprehensive coverage of required areas: Missing details (e.g., Q1 docs, Q2 validation), decision criteria (e.g., Q3 prioritization, Q4 authority), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q3 assessment, Q8 compliance), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q11 milestones, Q13 duration/bottlenecks), exceptions (e.g., Q9 refusals, Q10 special cases, Q7 repairs).
  - No SQL, code, or technical implementation: All conceptual/process-focused (e.g., Q11 tools usage is high-level, not "how CRM queries work").
  - Excellent organization: Categorized structure enhances clarity, targets nuances (e.g., regional variations in Q14), and ends with strong summary.
  - Logical flow mirrors process description; examples prompt specifics without leading.

- **Minor Flaws (Strict Deductions, Preventing 10.0)**:
  - **Q15 (Post-Onboarding)**: Mildly off-topic. Process description ends at activation/lease/quality checks (onboarding lifecycle); occupancy/retention/feedback loops are ongoing management, not onboarding clarification. Extrapolates beyond described scope (-0.4).
  - **Overabundance/Redundancy**: ~25-30 sub-questions (bullets under headings count as distinct). "Targeted series" implies concise (e.g., 10-15 total); excess dilutes focus, with minor overlap (e.g., exceptions in Q9/Q10/Q17-equivalent, timing in Q11/Q13). Not "flawless" efficiency (-0.2).
  - **Slight Leading Phrasing**: Rare but present, e.g., Q1 "without delaying the process" assumes delay risk; Q7 "non-negotiable versus negotiable" presupposes binary. Hypercritically, nudges responses (-0.1).
  - **No Major Inaccuracies/Unclarities**: All align with description; no logical gaps.

Nearly flawless (handles complexity elegantly), but strict policy demands deduction for even these minors. Equivalent to A- in academic grading.
