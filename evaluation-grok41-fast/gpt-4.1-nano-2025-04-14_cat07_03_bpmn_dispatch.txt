**9.2**

### Reasoning for Grade:
- **Strengths (high marks for accuracy, completeness, structure)**:
  - Captures the core start ("shipping goods"  "clarify shipment method"  "special handling?" branch  "handling options" or "get offers from three logistics companies"  "pick company"  "place order").
  - Accurately describes the insurance branch ("insurance required?"  "customer insurance information"  "insure parcel").
  - Includes key downstream steps: "write package label"  "parcel inspection"  insurance re-check (matches a likely decision node)  dispatch prep  "packed/prepared"  "delay"  "notify customer"  "shipment paperwork"  "pickup area"  "prepared".
  - Notes branches/decisions clearly (e.g., special handling, insurance twice).
  - Provides a concise, logical narrative flow with a strong summary—easy to follow and comprehensive.

- **Minor weaknesses (deducting ~0.8)**:
  - Slight sequence ambiguity: Says "sent for dispatch" *before* "packed and prepared," but flowchart likely sequences packing/inspection earlier (pre-dispatch). Minor logical hiccup.
  - Interpretive phrasing like "triggers clarification" or "considers handling options" is good but not verbatim (e.g., exact node labels like "Special handling?" or "Parcel inspection").
  - No major omissions, but could label decisions more precisely (e.g., diamonds as yes/no paths).

Overall, excellent match to the flowchart's structure, branches, and steps—near-perfect for a textual summary.
