**9.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (justifying high score)**: 
  - Correctly identifies violating cases (2, 3, 5) and compliant ones (1, 4) with no errors in classification.
  - Detailed, structured analysis with clear sequences, highlighted violations, direct quotes/references to the normative description, logical interpretations of ambiguities (e.g., "directly proceed to Cancel" implies no intervening Auth in cancel path; fulfillment requires all steps).
  - Excellent use of summary table for clarity and quick reference.
  - Thorough on primary violations: Case 2 (Package before Auth), Case 3 (Ship after Cancel), Case 5 (Ship without Package).
  - Good inference that cancel path excludes fulfillment activities (Auth, Ship) and requires direct Check -> Cancel.

- **Flaws/Deductions (strictly penalizing even minors, preventing 10.0)**:
  - **Hedging/inaccuracy in Case 3 (moderate deduction, -0.5)**: Describes Auth before Cancel as "less critical" and "inefficient processing/wasted," softening what should be a firm violation. Description mandates *direct* progression to Cancel after Check for insufficient inventory ("directly proceed") and ties Auth to sufficiency ("only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known"). This introduces unnecessary ambiguity/equivocation.
  - **Incomplete violations in Case 3 (moderate deduction, -0.5)**: Misses explicit "Ship without Package" (no Package occurs at all, violating "Ship order should only occur after packaging" regardless of Cancel). Case 5 correctly flags this analogously, creating inconsistent thoroughness. Subsumed under "illogical sequence," but not stated directly—hypercritical view sees this as an omission of a parallel rule.
  - **Minor inconsistencies (minor deductions, -0.2 total)**: Case 3 detailed analysis lists 3 violations, but summary table lists only 1 "primary" (Ship after Cancel), understating. Slight misquote in Case 5 ("after packaging *and before closing order*"—description implies but doesn't explicitly state "before closing"; Close always follows).
  - No logical flaws in overall reasoning, unclarities minimal, no factual errors in sequences/logs.

Nearly flawless (structure, coverage, accuracy ~95%), but the above prevent perfection under "hypercritical" criteria. Equivalent to A- in academic grading.
