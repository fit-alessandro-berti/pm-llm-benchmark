**10.0**

The provided SQL query is flawless and precisely meets all requirements with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws:

- **Sequence detection**: Uses `row_number()` partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `"timestamp"` to enforce strict temporal ordering, then self-joins on consecutive `rn` values (`rn+1`, `rn+2`) to identify *direct* succession (no intervening events), exactly as specified.
- **Timing filter**: Correctly computes `(o3."timestamp" - o2."timestamp") > INTERVAL '5 days'`, which is valid DuckDB syntax (interval arithmetic and comparison work as expected).
- **Case exclusion**: `DISTINCT case_id` in `bad_cases` captures any case with *at least one* matching sequence+timing, then `NOT IN` excludes *all events* from those cases via the final filter—precisely inverting the criteria.
- **Output**: Returns `e.*` (all columns/events) from qualifying cases, with sensible `ORDER BY e.case_id, e."timestamp"` for readability (prompt mentions "proper ... ordering").
- **Efficiency/robustness**: CTEs are clean; handles multiple sequences per case correctly; assumes standard event log properties (timestamps order events, uniqueness not required but arbitrary ties in `row_number()` are a non-issue as prompt implies distinguishable timestamps); DuckDB-compatible (quoting `"timestamp"`, interval syntax).
- **No extras/missing**: No unnecessary columns, groups, or aggregations; comments accurate; no side effects.

Zero deductions—even minor edge cases (e.g., equal timestamps) align with typical event log assumptions and don't violate spec.
