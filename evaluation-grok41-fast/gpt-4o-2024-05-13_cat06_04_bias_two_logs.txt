**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**: Correctly identifies bias favoring Group B (Unprotected), accurately attributes it primarily to `CommunityGroup`-triggered `+10 ScoreAdjustment` (Community Boost), with solid examples (U001: 720730; U003: 695705). Notes lack of adjustments in Group A. Highlights key discrepancy (U003 at 705 approved vs. P002 at 710 rejected), correctly links `LocalResident=TRUE` correlation to Group B's eligibility for boost. Structure is logical (comparison points, impact, analysis, conclusion). Discusses systematic differences in decisions due to attributes as required.
- **Inaccuracies (significant deductions)**:
  - "Similar preliminary score" for U003 (695) vs. P002 (710): 15-point gap is material (boost is only +10); not similar in context of scores/decisions. (-0.8)
  - Approval rates phrased misleadingly: "All three cases are approved (U001, U003) except U002" implies higher rate for B; actually identical 2/3 both groups. (-0.4)
- **Logical flaws/unclarities (deductions)**:
  - Claims decisions "favor Group B more often" and skew "towards more approvals in Group B"; rates/numbers identical, undermining quantification of bias (bias is in score manipulation allowing lower initial scores to pass, not raw count). (-0.5)
  - Over-speculates `LocalResident` as separate "implicit" favoritism "despite explicit absence in scoring"; boost is explicitly tied to `CommunityGroup` (only present in LocalResident=TRUE cases), not implicit or absent. U002 (LocalResident=TRUE, no group) gets no boost/rejected like P002—evidence against standalone local bias, yet unaddressed. (-0.4)
  - Does not explicitly state "Group B log exhibits bias" (question's direct ask); implies via favoritism but compares logs holistically without pinpointing B's log as the exhibiting one (A's shows neutral process). (-0.3)
- **Minor issues (cumulative deductions)**: Extra unasked remedies in conclusion (neutral but wordy); awkward approval phrasing; no note U002 mirrors P002 exactly (strengthens no-boost parity). (-0.4 total)
- **Overall**: Strong, comprehensive, nearly flawless on core identification/manifestation, but cumulative minor+medium issues (inaccuracy, logic gaps) prevent 9+. Base 10  -2.8 = 8.2.
