The provided "answer" catastrophically fails to address the draft prompt's explicit task: crafting a DuckDB SQL query. Instead, it incorrectly evaluates and revises the prompt itself, demonstrating a fundamental misunderstanding of the instructions. No SQL query is produced, no grouping/filtering logic is attempted, and core requirements (e.g., counting events per `case_id`, excluding >6, returning filtered events) are ignored entirely. This is not a minor inaccuracy—it's a complete non-response to the query-writing objective, rendering it worthless for the benchmark. Even under less strict criteria, it earns no credit; hypercritically, it's the minimum score.
