The response is exemplary: comprehensive, accurate, logically flawless, and directly addresses all task elements with precise calculations (durations correctly approximated and contextually sufficient; e.g., 2002's ~26 hours aligns with 25h55m delta), insightful attribute correlations (Complexity as primary driver validated by data; Resource bottlenecks like Lisa's 3 requests vs. Mike's 2 pinpointed; Region effects properly controlled for confounding), clear visualizations (tables enhance readability without errors), robust explanations (e.g., sequential requests add ~20-24h waits empirically derived), and actionable mitigations (quantified impacts, SLAs, hierarchy). No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or flaws—even approximations are transparently reasonable and non-misleading. Structure is professional and concise. Perfect adherence to prompt.
