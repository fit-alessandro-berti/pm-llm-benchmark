**9.8**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
This response is exceptionally strong—targeted, open-ended, conceptually focused, and directly aligned with the prompt's goals (e.g., decision criteria in Q1/Q2/Q5/Q6; roles/responsibilities in Q6/Q8/Q12; timing/sequencing in Q7/Q10; exceptions in Q3/Q6/Q12/Q14; missing details like risk/feedback/prioritization in Q11/Q13). All 15 questions probe the described process without venturing into SQL, tech implementation, or non-conceptual areas. They are logically sequenced, building from intake to post-onboarding, and use precise language tied to the description (e.g., "custom lease clauses," "inspection").

**Minor deductions (total -0.2):**
- Intro claims "**a few** clarifying questions" but delivers 15: Semantic mismatch ("few" implies 3-5); pedantic but a clarity flaw under hypercriticism (-0.1).
- Q14 introduces "partially onboarded (e.g., listed but not yet inspected)"—a plausible extension but slightly speculative vs. strictly "uncovering missing details" from the description (no explicit partial onboarding mentioned); risks assuming process gaps prematurely (-0.1).
- No other inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, repetition, or off-topic elements. Coverage is comprehensive yet non-exhaustive (e.g., could've probed photographer selection or tenant negotiation more, but not required).

Nearly flawless; only ultrastrict nitpicks prevent perfection.
