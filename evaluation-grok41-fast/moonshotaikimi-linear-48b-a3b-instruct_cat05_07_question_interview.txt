**7.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is strong in structure, coverage, and intent but incurs deductions for multiple violations of the prompt's explicit boundaries, logical assumptions, and minor unclarities. It is not "nearly flawless" due to ~25% of questions delving into prohibited "implementation details" (e.g., system propagation, algorithms, storage locations, automated tests, reconciliation logic), which shift from *conceptual* process understanding to technical mechanics. Even under strict interpretation, these are not mere hypotheticals but direct probes into system behaviors, undermining the "no implementation details" rule. Additional flaws compound this.

#### Strengths (Supporting High Base Score):
- **Format & Completeness (9/10)**: Clean numbered list of 20 open-ended questions (How/What/Can you examples dominate). Intro/outro frame it well as probing "people, decisions, breakdowns" – aligns with goals.
- **Coverage of Goals (9/10)**: Excellent on decision criteria (Q2,4,7,10), roles/responsibilities (Q1,13,15), exceptions (Q5,14,16,20), timing/sequencing (Q9,19), missing details (Q11,18). Uncovers nuances like audits, escalations, real cases.
- **Targeted & Probing (8.5/10)**: Deep, real-world focus (e.g., Q20's "off the rails" example is flawless for exceptions).

#### Critical Flaws (Heavy Deductions, -2.8 Total):
1. **Prohibited Implementation Details (Major Violation, -1.5)**: 5 questions directly request system-level mechanics, violating "no ... implementation details" and "conceptual understanding only":
   | Question | Issue |
   |----------|-------|
   | Q3 | "Field edited... propagated... notified if propagation fails" – pure system integration/tech failure handling. |
   | Q4 | "System decide between 'round-robin' vs 'best-match' logic... who overrides" – algorithmic logic details. |
   | Q6 | "Recorded/summarized... where does that summary live" – data storage/audit tech. |
   | Q12 | "Automated test runs (e.g., checking ratios)" – automation mechanics. |
   | Q17 | "Which takes precedence... how detected/reconciled" – system sync/resolution processes.
   
   These comprise 25% of the list; under hyperstrictness, each is a significant flaw warranting deduction.

2. **Logical Assumptions/Introduces Unmentioned Elements (Moderate, -0.6)**: 
   - Q4 assumes "algorithm/system" (original describes human factors like "workload, specialization").
   - Q11 introduces "broker" and "platform does not allow advertised publicly" (absent from description).
   - Q16 assumes a "recent case where... broke down" exists (speculative; risks leading question).
   - Q8 veers tangential (privacy/regulatory disclosures not core to onboarding process).

3. **Minor Unclarities/Over-Specificity (Minor but Deducted, -0.4)**:
   - Q3 adds unprompted assumption: "central property database is often a primary source of truth."
   - Q7: "Dollar threshold or safety rating" – good, but implies quantifiable rules without basis.
   - Length (20 questions): "Series" implies concise (10-15 ideal); excess risks dilution.
   - Phrasing: Occasional loaded terms (Q4 "pushes back"; Q9 "sits 'activated' but zero interest") subtly bias responses.

#### Overall Rationale:
Base of 9.0 for excellence in goals/coverage, minus 2.8 for flaws = 6.2, uplifted +1.0 for comprehensive nuance and no SQL/off-topic drifts. **7.2** reflects "very good but flawed" – high enough for utility, low enough for strictness (not 9+ "nearly flawless"). Fix implementation questions  9.5+.
