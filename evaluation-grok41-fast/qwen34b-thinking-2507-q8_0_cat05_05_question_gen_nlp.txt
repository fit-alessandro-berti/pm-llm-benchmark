The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It delivers exactly 20 distinct, open-ended questions (all starting with interrogative structures like "How," "What," "Could," or "In what ways," ensuring no yes/no closure). Each is precisely grounded in the described process (e.g., specific references to Taiwan semiconductors, Malaysian assembly, JIT vs. aggregated shipments, carbon footprint, digital systems/ML, compliance, etc.), while probing insights (e.g., Q20 on long-term value), issues (e.g., Q5 on currency fluctuations), improvements (e.g., Q8 on blockchain traceability), and implications (e.g., Q10 on reshoring trade-offs). No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws—every question is sophisticated, non-repetitive, and directly actionable for deep analysis. The brief intro is purely contextual framing without excess verbosity or deviation, aligning with "just list the questions" as the core content is the numbered list. No SQL or extraneous elements.
