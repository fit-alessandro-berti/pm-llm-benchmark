**8.5**

The answer correctly identifies **Group B's log** as exhibiting bias, accurately tying it to the `ScoreAdjustment` (+10 "Community Boost") exclusively applied to cases with `CommunityGroup = "Highland Civic Darts Club"` (U001, U003), which is absent in Group A. It properly explains manifestation through differential treatment, impact on decisions (e.g., U003's approval despite low preliminary score), and systematic advantage lowering effective threshold for qualifying Group B applicants. Discussion of `CommunityGroup` as a proxy, interplay with `LocalResident` (not causal alone, per U002), and disparate impact on Group A is precise and comprehensive.

Deductions for logical inaccuracy in U003 analysis: claims "threshold appears to be at or above 710" based on P002/U002 rejections, but U003's 705 (adjusted) is approved—contradicting the stated threshold (<710 yet approved vs. 710 rejected). This undermines the "clear-cut" example and ignores data inconsistency in rules engine application. Minor unclarity in "similarly scored applicant in Group A" (no exact match; P002 at 710  U003's 695/705). Structure and coverage are otherwise flawless, but these issues prevent a top score under hypercritical criteria.
