**4.0**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Major Factual Inaccuracies in Model Descriptions (Severe Deduction: -3.0 base penalty)**:
  - **Model 1**: Claims "Conduct Interviews (in parallel with Screen Candidates)". This is fundamentally wrong. The graph has `Screen  Interview` *and* `Screen  Decide`, meaning **Interviews occur *after* Screening** (with Decide also after Screening, potentially concurrent with Interview). There is no parallelism *with* Screening itself—Screening strictly precedes both. This misrepresents the partial order, inverting a key normative strength (Screening before Interviewing) into a fabricated anomaly. The sequence diagram "Post  Screen  Interview (parallel with Screen)" is logically incoherent and visually mangled.
  - **Model 2**: Sequence implies "Post  Screen (parallel with Interview)  Decide", but Screen has **no outgoing edges** (dead-end after Post). Decide is only reachable via `Post  Interview  Decide`. Screening is isolated/irrelevant to the decision path, a critical anomaly completely overlooked. Parallelism is correct (both after Post), but flow attribution is false.
  - Both models wrongly attributed "parallel Screen and Interview" anomaly identically, erasing key differences: Model 1 enforces Screening before Interview (good), Model 2 allows Interview without Screening (bad).

- **Missed Critical Anomalies (Severe Deduction: -1.5)**:
  - **Model 1**: Fails to identify the worst issue—`Screen  Decide  Onboard` allows **hiring/onboarding without Interview** (path skips Interview entirely). This violates core logic (decide after interview). "Linear flow lacking choices/loops" is minor/irrelevant; real anomaly is skipping Interview.
  - **Model 2**: Ignores Screening as **useless dead-end** (executed optionally post-Post, never influences Decide/Onboard). Loop `*(Onboard, skip)` is noted but understated (mandatory Onboard + repeatable weirdness); XOR Payroll noted but not flagged as post-hiring compliance risk (hire/onboard without payroll).

- **Logical Flaws in Comparison/Justification (Moderate Deduction: -1.0)**:
  - Claims Model 1 "closer" due to "fewer/less severe deviations" and Model 2's "more fundamental issues" (loop/choice). Conclusion arguably defensible (Model 1 has correct ScreeningInterview precedence and no skips/loops; Model 2 adds structural nonsense), but rests on inverted premises (e.g., both have "same parallel anomaly"). Lacks quantification of "severity" (e.g., skipping Interview vs. useless Screening). "Legal/compliance concerns" for Model 2 payroll skip is good but speculative/unsubstantiated.
  - No explicit normative sequence defined for comparison (task requires "expected order").

- **Unclarities and Minor Issues (Minor Deduction: -0.5)**:
  - Bold/italic formatting and arrow sequences are messy/ambiguous (e.g., "1. Post  Screen  Interview (parallel with Screen)").
  - Overemphasis on "lacks choices/loops" as anomaly—normative process *can* be linear.
  - Superficial "real-world" references (inefficiencies) without tying to POWL semantics (e.g., partial order concurrency implications).

- **Strengths (Why Not Lower)**: Structure follows task (analysis, anomalies, comparison). Correctly flags Model 2 loop/XOR as odd. Picks arguably right model (Model 1 closer: preserves Screening precedence, linear post-Decide). No criminal/policy violations.

**Overall**: Fundamentally flawed by graph misreads (core to POWL task), missing key anomalies, and sloppy flows. Not "nearly flawless"—mid-low score reflects partial insight amid errors. Equivalent to C-/D+ in academic grading.
