The provided answer delivers a comprehensive, precisely targeted list of 20 open-ended questions that systematically address all specified goals: uncovering missing details (e.g., alternatives for documents, KPIs), decision criteria (e.g., workload quantification, tenant prioritization), roles/responsibilities (e.g., approvals, authority), timing/sequencing (e.g., overlaps, phase durations, handoffs), and exceptions (e.g., repeated failures, custom clauses, special insurance). Questions are logically grouped for clarity, directly derived from the process description without introducing unrelated topics, and strictly avoid any SQL, technical implementation, or non-conceptual probes. Phrasing is neutral, non-leading, and invites detailed responses to deepen understanding. No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or logical flaws; the structure and closing rationale enhance usability without excess verbosity. This is exemplary and flawless execution.
