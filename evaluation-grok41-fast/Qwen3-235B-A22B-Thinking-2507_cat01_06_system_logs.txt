**10.0**

The final event log and explanation are exemplary: all non-SWITCH events from the raw log are precisely transformed and accounted for without omission or invention; case grouping by specific document/email is logically coherent, respects temporal resumption/interruptions, and produces analyst-friendly narratives (e.g., full workflows per case); activity names are meaningfully abstracted, consistent within case types (e.g., uniform for Word/Excel documents), and semantically precise (e.g., email stages, PDF review); required attributes are exactly met with pristine timestamps; SWITCH exclusion is rigorously justified as inter-case transitions; explanation is concise yet comprehensive, directly addressing all objectives with no ambiguities, contradictions, or unsubstantiated claims. Fully suitable for process mining tools, with no flaws detectable under hypercritical scrutiny.
