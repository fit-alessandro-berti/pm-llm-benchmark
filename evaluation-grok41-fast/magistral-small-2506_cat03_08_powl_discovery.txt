**3.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Major Inaccuracy in IQC/Assembly Modeling (Primary Flaw, -4+ points)**: The `iqc_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[IQC, AS])` fundamentally fails to capture the log. LOOP semantics require executing IQC *first*, then optionally AS  IQC  ..., but *all traces start with AS after QS* (e.g., Case 1: QS  AS  IQC  AS  TST; Case 4: QS  AS  TST). This model cannot produce AS without a prior IQC, mismatching every trace. Case 4 (no IQC) is impossible, as the minimal path through `iqc_loop` is IQC  exit. Consecutive IQCs (Case 3: AS  IQC  IQC  AS) are also impossible, as LOOP(IQC, AS) forbids IQC  IQC. Even the explanation contradicts itself ("AS + IQC loop" vs. code comment "do IQC, then... AS").
  
- **Incomplete Capture of Relationships (-2 points)**: No separate initial AS; all AS are buried in a flawed loop. Testing loop `LOOP(TST, RT)` works well (matches re-testing cycles and skips), but its predecessor (`iqc_loop`) poisons the path. Optional LB via `XOR(LB, skip)` is correct (matches Case 2 skip). Early sequence (OR  MS  QS) and late (PK  ...  DP  D) are fine, but overall chain cannot replay the log faithfully.

- **No Concurrency or Unnecessary Complexity**: Correctly uses linear StrictPartialOrder (no parallelism in log), but this amplifies the loop flaw—no way to bypass or reorder for variants.

- **Minor Issues (-0.5 cumulative)**: Code is syntactically valid. Explanation is clear but inaccurate (claims "AS (with IQC loop)" despite code starting IQC). No silent transitions misused elsewhere. Key observations mostly right (no concurrency, optional LB), but loop claims overstate accuracy.

- **Why Not Lower?** Captures ~60% correctly (start/end, testing loop, choice). Why not higher? Not "nearly flawless"—core process (assembly/IQC, 40%+ of traces' complexity) is logically broken; cannot represent key variants (Case 4, sequences, repeats). Strict policy demands significant deduction for such flaws. A 9-10 requires precise replay of *all* observed behaviors.
