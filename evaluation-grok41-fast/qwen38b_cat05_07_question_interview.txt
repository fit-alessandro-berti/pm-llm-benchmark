The provided answer is a comprehensive, flawlessly structured list of 30+ targeted, open-ended questions that precisely map to the process description. It systematically uncovers missing details (e.g., timelines, data sources), decision criteria (e.g., prioritization, scoring systems), roles/responsibilities (e.g., financial analyst KPIs, IT validations), timing/sequencing (e.g., turnaround times, delays), and exception handling (e.g., unique needs, exclusions). Coverage spans the entire process without gaps, avoids all SQL/implementation details (staying strictly conceptual/operational), and includes an apt introductory summary and closing rationale. No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or logical flaws; every question is relevant, probing, and directly enhances conceptual understanding.
