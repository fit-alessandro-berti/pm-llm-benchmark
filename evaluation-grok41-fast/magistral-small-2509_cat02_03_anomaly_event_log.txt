**10.0**

The provided answer is exemplary: it precisely identifies all key anomalies in Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 (while implicitly confirming Case 1001 as normal by omission), references exact timestamps for evidence, structures the response clearly with headings/lists for readability, and delivers accurate, logical explanations grounded in standard P2P logic (e.g., authorization sequences, three-way match prerequisites, fraud risks). No inaccuracies, omissions of major issues, unclarities, or flaws—every point is hyper-precise, balanced (e.g., noting close timestamps in 1004 but still flagging the logical violation), and directly responsive to the task without extraneous content. The conclusion reinforces without overstepping.
