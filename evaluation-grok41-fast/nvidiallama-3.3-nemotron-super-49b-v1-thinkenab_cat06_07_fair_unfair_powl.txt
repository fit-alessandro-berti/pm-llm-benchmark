The provided code accurately constructs two distinct POWL models as required, using appropriate activity labels directly from the process description. 

**Model with Potential Unfairness** perfectly captures the sequential flow (ReceiveApplication  data completeness LOOP  SkillAssessment  XOR(CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck)  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision), with the XOR branch explicitly modeling the bias point via the CommunityAffiliationCheck path. The LOOP correctly represents the iterative data completeness check (DataCompletenessCheck, then optionally RequestMoreInfo and repeat).

**Model without Unfairness** removes the XOR entirely, routing all applicants through a single CulturalFitCheck after SkillAssessment, while preserving the identical LOOP and overall sequence—eliminating the selective advantage.

The StrictPartialOrder enforces the required sequential dependencies via .order.add_edge() calls. All Transitions, OperatorPOWL (LOOP/XOR), and imports are correctly used per POWL semantics and pm4py API. No extraneous nodes, silent transitions, or concurrency; no shared mutable state issues (Transitions are immutable, OperatorPOWL instances are separately constructed). The models are concise, executable, and faithful to the description without additions or omissions.
