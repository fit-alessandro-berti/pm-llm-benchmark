9.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (near-flawless aspects)**: The updated dictionary is syntactically valid Python code, preserves every original constraint exactly, correctly formats all new binary constraints per the prompt's structure (e.g., nested dicts with "support":1.0, "confidence":1.0). New activities (CheckApplicantRace, ManualReview) are logically apt proxies for bias points. Constraints semantically align well with DECLARE meanings and directly address bias mitigation (e.g., non-succession prevents direct biased paths, response/precedence/coexistence force fairness checks). Rationale is clear, structured, and explains bias reduction per constraint, fulfilling output requirements. Overall logic robustly limits bias by mandating intermediaries post-sensitive checks and before decisions.
- **Flaws Penalized Heavily (minor but clear issues warranting deduction)**:
  1. **Inconsistent numbering in inline code comments**: Coexistence labeled "# New Constraint 1", response "# New Constraint 3", precedence "# New Constraint 2" (appearing after 3), nonsuccession "# New Constraint 4". Sequential illogic creates unclarity/sloppy presentation; rationale renumbers correctly but code comments mislead reader on order (deduction: -0.5).
  2. **Slight over-broadening**: Coexistence/precedence apply ManualReview to *all* FinalDecision, not targeted to "sensitive demographics" as prompted (e.g., no Approve_Minority-like activities; uses generic FinalDecision/CheckApplicantRace proxy). Effective but not precisely tailored, missing nuance for "involving applicants from sensitive demographics" (deduction: -0.3).
  3. **Typo in rationale text**: "non_succession" (underscore) vs. correct code "nonsuccession" (no underscore); minor inaccuracy in documentation (deduction: -0.2).
- **No major inaccuracies/logical flaws**: No violations of DECLARE semantics, bias logic sound, no broken format/Python errors. Total: Starts at 10.0, deducts 1.0 for cumulative minors per "hypercritical" strictness (even presentation slips "significantly lower"). Still very high as core task aced.
