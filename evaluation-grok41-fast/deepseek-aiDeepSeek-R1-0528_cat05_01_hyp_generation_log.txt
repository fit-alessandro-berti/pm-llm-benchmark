**6.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Anomalies correctly identified across cases 1002-1004 (out-of-sequence, missing activities; case 1001 implicitly normal). Hypotheses are plausible (e.g., priority bypass, manual overrides) and tied to data like order_type/order_value. Some queries (Q4) are solid, PostgreSQL-valid, and investigate hypotheses (e.g., high-value shortcuts via MIN timestamps, payment < invoice). Joins tables appropriately where needed.
- **Major Flaws (heavy penalties)**:
  - **Q1 logical error**: LAG checks *immediate* predecessor only (e.g., catches adjacent issues but misses non-adjacent like Ship Goods << Credit Check in 1002 where prev=Confirm Shipment). WHERE conditions arbitrary/incomplete (e.g., Confirm Shipment expects prev in ['Validate Stock', 'Credit Check'] ignores Register Order path; won't generalize). Outputs noise, not true sequence violations.
  - **Q2 syntax/precision issues**: BOOL_OR(activity = 'X') works but fragile (NULL if no logs; assumes all cases in orders have logs). HAVING catches *any* missing but doesn't *list* which (violates "investigate further"); omits key missings like Issue Invoice for payment anomalies.
  - **Q3 inaccuracy/non-applicable**: Assumes violations exist (e.g., non-Logistics shipping) but data shows perfect dept matches (all resources correct). 'Cashier%' LIKE arbitrary (flags non-cashiers, but 1004's FinanceTeam_02 *is* Cashier—no flag). Hypotheses unproven; query returns empty/false positives.
  - **Q5 irrelevance**: Generic lag/lead dump; no anomaly filter, hypothesis link, or dept cross-check. Useless for "investigating hypotheses" (e.g., no WHERE for Logistics-Finance gaps).
- **Minor Flaws (further deductions)**: No extraction/parsing of additional_info (e.g., credit_score, amount for fraud hypotheses). No correlation queries (e.g., priority vs. anomalies via GROUP BY). Q4 hardcodes >2000 (data-driven? 1004=3000, but arbitrary). No handling multiples (MIN assumes one event). Unclear "Key Focus" repeats without new insight. Overall, queries don't fully "investigate hypotheses" (e.g., no resource training via role counts).
- **Holistic**: ~60% effective (good anomaly spot, 1-2 solid queries) but flawed execution prevents >7. Not "nearly flawless"—logical gaps make unreliable for real DB.
