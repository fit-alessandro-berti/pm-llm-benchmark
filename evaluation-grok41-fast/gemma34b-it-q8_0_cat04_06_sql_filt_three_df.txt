**1.0**

The provided answer is fundamentally flawed and fails to address the prompt on every level:

- **Primary query (`WHERE 1=0`)**: Returns **zero rows** from `event_log`, but the prompt requires returning **all events from cases that do NOT match the criteria** (i.e., the vast majority of events/cases should be included). This is the opposite of what's asked—it's a non-solution that excludes everything indiscriminately. Claiming it's a "trick to achieve the desired exclusion" is incorrect; no actual filtering by `case_id`, sequence, or timing occurs.

- **Alternative query**: Syntactically broken and logically incoherent.
  - No check for the **full three-activity sequence in direct succession** (e.g., no ordering by `timestamp` within `case_id` to verify `Approve Purchase Requisition` immediately followed by `Create Order` immediately followed by `Confirm Order` with nothing in between).
  - `e1.timestamp = e2.timestamp` in the JOIN is impossible for distinct activities, rendering the EXISTS useless.
  - No computation of time elapsed >5 days between `Create Order` and `Confirm Order` (e.g., no `timestamp` subtraction or `INTERVAL '5 days'` comparison).
  - The `NOT EXISTS` for `e3` inverts timing backward (`e3.timestamp < min(Approve timestamp)` after `Create Order`?) and references undefined `e1.case_id`.
  - Outer `WHERE NOT (EXISTS ... AND NOT EXISTS ...)` has scoping errors (`e1.case_id` undefined in subqueries) and doesn't correlate properly to the outer `event_log`.
  - Fails to identify/group by `case_id` for exclusion.

- **Explanations**: Misrepresent the queries (e.g., no 5-day logic exists; "violates the 5-day constraint" is fabricated). Prefers the broken empty-result query over a correct one for bogus efficiency reasons. Ignores DuckDB specifics like window functions (`LAG/LEAD`) or `ROW_NUMBER()` for sequence detection.

- **Minor issues compounding failure**: No `ORDER BY timestamp` handling for succession; assumes single instances per activity without `MAX/MIN` properly; no final output of **events** (just broken filters).

Zero requirements met. This is not a valid SQL solution by any metric.
