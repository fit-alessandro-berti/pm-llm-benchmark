The provided code is flawless in structure, logic, and fidelity to the scenario. All transitions use correct descriptive labels matching the scenario (e.g., "Service Request", "Debug & Reconfigure"). The loop `OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [bnc, dnr])` precisely captures the repeated BNC with optional D&R. The XOR `OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, [cd, md])` correctly models the exclusive choice without unnecessary silents. The root `StrictPartialOrder` includes exactly the top-level nodes (operators encapsulate children properly, as noted). Edges enforce all dependencies accurately:

- SR  CS
- CS  DA, CS  ACI (concurrency via no DAACI edge)
- DA  loop, ACI  loop (loop after both)
- loop  deployment_choice
- deployment_choice  QA, deployment_choice  SA (concurrency)
- QA  GLA, SA  GLA (GLA after both)

No extraneous edges, nodes, or silents. Imports match requirements. Comments clarify construction. Print statements are harmless verification aids. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws.
