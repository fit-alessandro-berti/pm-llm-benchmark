**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting score above 5)**: Comprehensive structure mirroring the question (activities, constraints, interplay, goals/regs). Covers *all* model categories explicitly or grouped logically. Practical real-life mappings are insightful and relevant (e.g., Z as zero-tolerance). Interplay discussed implicitly via examples (exactly-one B, noncoexist G&A, QA mandates). Speculation on goals/regs (Basel, AML/KYC, CFPB) is apt, detailed, and tied to constraints. Language clear, professional; no major omissions.
  
- **Critical Flaws Deducting from 10 (strict deductions)**:
  - **Inaccuracies in constraint directions/interpretations (-1.5)**: Core to task. Model consistently uses `activity: {'target': next}` implying source  target flow (e.g., response(AB), precedence(EF)). Answer swaps/reverses twice:
    | Constraint | Model | Answer Label/Explanation | Issue |
    |------------|--------|---------------------------|-------|
    | altprecedence | H  G | "(H G)": "H preceded by G" | Reverses to G  H; illogical swap for "logic" but unfaithful to model. |
    | chainprecedence | F  B | "(F B)": "F preceded by B" | Reverses to B  F; authorize *precedes* credit check? Model illogical, but answer distorts further. |
    Precedence sloppy "(F E)" label despite correct explanation (-0.3 extra).
  - **Unclear/imprecise semantics (-0.8)**: Alternating/chaining vague/over-speculative (e.g., "allow multiple loans"; "immediate" for chainresponse DG skips steps like E/F; alt-precedence as "prevent premature info" assumes swap). Succession BC "directly precedes" ok but not hyper-precise (immediate successor?). Nonchainsuccession explanation adds "without proper intermediate validation" — inferred, not model-direct.
  - **Logical flaws/minor gaps (-0.3)**: Interplay not deeply integrated (e.g., no synthesis of exactly-one B + succession BC + responded_existence DE into "controlled sequence"); assumes model logic where illogical (e.g., chainprecedence FB unaddressed). Responded_existence/coexistence explained well but not tied to "transparency/quality" explicitly as prompted.
  - **Unclarities/style (-0.2)**: Some redundancy (e.g., QA repeated); speculative phrasing ("likely reflect", "indicates seriousness") ok for "speculate" but hyperbolic ("embodies rigorous workflow logic").

- **Why not lower?** No factual invention (stays to model keys); 90%+ coverage accurate/practical. Why not higher? Not "nearly flawless" — directional errors undermine "analyze the ... model" fidelity; strictness demands perfection on semantics. 10=flawless model mirroring; 9=minor phrasing; 8=minor logic; this hits multiple interpretive errors.
