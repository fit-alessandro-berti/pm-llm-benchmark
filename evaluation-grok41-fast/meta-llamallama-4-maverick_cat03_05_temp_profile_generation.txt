**2.0**

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Incompleteness and Lack of Representativeness (-3.0)**: The dictionary includes only 8 pairs focused on early activities (SS, OP, RC, PT, DT), completely omitting QI, CA, PK, WS, and AS despite the prompt explicitly listing all 10 activities as part of every process execution. No pairs involve these (e.g., no (QI, CA), (CA, PT), (PK, DT), (WS, AS), or long-range like (SS, AS)). This is not a "representative subset" of the full supply chain; it ignores half the process, failing "ensuring complexity by considering pairs... separated by multiple steps" across the entire chain.
- **Logical Flaw and Inconsistency in Estimations (-2.5)**: Times do not add up consistently. E.g., SSRC (1,468,800s ~17 days) + RCPT (604,800s ~7 days) = 2,073,600s (~24 days), but SSPT is wrongly 2,116,800s (~24.5 days)—clear arithmetic error. Std devs use inconsistent methods (e.g., sqrt-sum for SSRC but linear addition elsewhere like RCDT: 172,800 + 172,800 = 345,600). Skips intermediate activities (e.g., RCPT ignores QI/CA time; PTDT ignores PK/WS).
- **Insufficient Complexity and Coverage (-1.5)**: Only ~8/45 possible sequential pairs; mostly early chain. No distant pairs (e.g., SSAS, OPAS) or mid-chain (e.g., QIDT). "Representative subset" requires broader coverage for a "complex global supply chain."
- **Formatting and Presentation Issues (-0.5)**: Final boxed output uses LaTeX set notation `{...}` mimicking dict but not pure Python dict syntax in isolation. Extra verbose reasoning clutters what should be a direct dictionary output. Minor but noted strictly.
- **Arbitrary/Unjustified Estimations (-0.5)**: Estimates "based on typical supply chain" but vague (e.g., PTDT "10 days" arbitrary, skipping steps). Std devs ad-hoc, not derived rigorously from "multiple process executions."

**Base score ~1.0 for basic format/seconds units/logical flow assumption; penalties drop to 2.0.** Not nearly flawless—major flaws in accuracy, completeness, and logic prevent higher score.
