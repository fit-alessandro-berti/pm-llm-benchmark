The provided answer is flawless. The SQL query precisely meets all requirements: it correctly identifies `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via a subquery with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then filters the full `event_log` to return only events from those cases using `WHERE case_id IN (...)`. This is standard SQL fully compatible with DuckDB, logically sound, efficient for the task (two scans, no unnecessary materialization), and handles all cases correctly without assumptions about data (e.g., duplicates, timestamps). The explanation is accurate, concise, structured, and directly reinforces the query's mechanics without extraneous details. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or minor issues whatsoever.
