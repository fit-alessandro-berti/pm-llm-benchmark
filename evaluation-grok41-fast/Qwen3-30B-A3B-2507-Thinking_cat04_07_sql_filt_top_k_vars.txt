The provided answer delivers a correct, complete, and efficient DuckDB SQL query that precisely meets all requirements:

- Extracts ordered sequences per `case_id` using `ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp)`, accurately capturing variants.
- Groups by sequence (array), counts frequencies, and selects top K via `ORDER BY variant_count DESC LIMIT :K`.
- Filters to exact cases in top K variants via join on sequences, excluding others.
- Returns all original events (`event_log.*`) for those cases only, with logical ordering.

No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws: array representation is ideal (exact, order-preserving, delimiter-safe); CTE structure is optimal; placeholder `:K` is appropriately handled with usage notes; example validates logic perfectly. Fully compliant and robust.
