**10.0**

The provided SQL query is precisely correct, efficient, and fully matches the requirements: it uses a subquery to identify `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then filters the full `event_log` to return all events for those cases only. DuckDB syntax is standard and supported. The explanation accurately describes the logic without errors or ambiguities. No inaccuracies, inefficiencies, or extraneous elements; it is flawless.
