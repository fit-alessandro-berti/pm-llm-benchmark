**5.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: 
  - Correct columns and structure (Markdown table perfect).
  - All *real* events extracted and mapped accurately for 1001, 1002 (except sorting), 1003, 1005 (34/36 rows correct in concept).
  - Excellent resource mapping using Resources table (names correct, blank for payments logical).
  - Good other attributes (relevant, structured as key-value strings).
  - Activity names logical and consistent with prompt examples.
  - Handles splits/multiples (e.g., multiple pickings, deliveries, invoices/payments per order).

- **Critical Flaws (major penalties, per strict criteria)**:
  - **Data integration errors (fatal)**: Assigned INV-1004 (order_id **1003**) and PAY-2004 to order **1004** (no invoice/payment exists for 1004). This duplicates events (same timestamp/amount/reference as 1003's correct ones), invents non-existent events, violates "Link each event using the keys provided" and "every event for every `order_id`". Process mining log corrupted (wrong cases).
  - **Chronological incorrectness**: For case 1002, rows not sorted by timestamp – Dispatch DLV-5003 (2024-01-05T07:00:00Z) appears *after* Arrival DLV-5002 (2024-01-07T16:10:00Z). Violates "ensure chronological order reflects real process flow" and "Maintain chronological correctness".
  - **Missing documentation**: No note on missing data for 1004 (no delivery/invoice/payment) or assumptions (e.g., blank resources). Prompt requires "document any assumptions made".
  - **Extra rows**: 36 rows instead of 34, bloating log with phantoms/duplicates.
  - **Logical flaws**: Duplicated identical event details across cases impossible; table unsortable for mining without rework.

These are not minor – core tasks (linking, chronology, completeness without extras) failed. Nearly flawless = 9-10; this is good effort but flawed execution (~70% accurate), hence 5.0 midpoint penalty.
