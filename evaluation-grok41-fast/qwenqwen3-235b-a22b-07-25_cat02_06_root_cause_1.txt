**9.2**

The answer is exceptionally strong overall: precise duration calculations, correct identification of long cases (102, 104, 105), clear structuring matching all three tasks, insightful pattern summary table, accurate linkage of factors (escalations, gaps, overnights) to delays, and practical recommendations. Minor deduction for one factual inaccuracy in Case 102's detailed analysis (incorrectly labeling the Mar 2 09:00 "Resolve Ticket" as "investigation" and misstating the 19-hour gap as from escalation rather than post-initial investigation), but this does not propagate to flawed conclusions, root cause patterns, or recommendations, which remain logically sound and data-driven. No unclarities or other flaws; nearly flawless under strict scrutiny.
