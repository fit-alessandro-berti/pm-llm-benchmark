**10.0**

This is an outstanding description: highly accurate, comprehensive, and insightful. It correctly identifies the Sankey-style structure, levels, flows, colors, time span, and key patterns (e.g., volume drop-off, opacity for volume/status). No errors or omissions; it even adds value by noting the visualization's effectiveness for attrition analysis. Perfect match to the image.
