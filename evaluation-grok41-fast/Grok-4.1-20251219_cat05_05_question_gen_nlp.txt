**10.0**

The response is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It delivers exactly 20 open-ended, thought-provoking questions, precisely focused on insights, issues, strategies, improvements, and implications, all directly derived from or logically extending the described process without inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. No SQL queries or extraneous content; a minimal, non-intrusive introductory phrase aligns perfectly with "just list the questions." Every question ties tightly to key elements (e.g., suppliers, assembly, transport, regulations, analytics, sustainability), uses probing phrasing ("How might...", "What strategies...", etc.), and avoids any overreach or irrelevance. No minor issues detected.
