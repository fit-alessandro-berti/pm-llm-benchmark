**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Anomalies (8.5/10)**: Correctly identifies core contradiction (noncoexistence E!C vs. intended flow requiring both). Good inference on C without E (model allows via weak precedence, but noncoex enforces no E in C-traces, undermining logic). Responded_existence interpretation (E requires prior A) reasonable given ambiguous notation, and conflict highlighted. Minor flaws: Arrow notation "E -> A" unclear/misleading (suggests E then A, but text clarifies precedence); doesn't explicitly note full chain conflict (e.g., existence C + responded AE  noncoex blocks C always).
- **Hypotheses (10/10)**: Perfect match to prompt examples—comprehensive, relevant, no inventions or irrelevancies.
- **Verification Approaches (6.5/10)**: 3/4 queries strong and directly tied to anomalies/intended flow (Q1 checks C w/o E; Q2 checks noncoex violations; Q4 checks existence C violations). Q3 major logical flaw: purporting to "identify if ... always correspond" but only retrieves confirming examples (A before E pairs), not counterexamples (E w/o prior A) needed to verify universal responded_existence/precedence. Fails prompt example ("if evaluation steps always correspond with assigned adjusters"). No joins to `adjusters` despite "correspond with adjusters" phrasing; assumes single events ignores multiples/timestamps properly but incomplete.
- **Overall Structure/Clarity (9/10)**: Well-organized, independent presentation, no prompt hints leaked. Concise, actionable SQL syntax correct (e.g., LEFT JOIN + IS NULL). Minor: Extra Q4 helpful but dilutes focus; no query for precedence RC or init R.
- **Total**: Strong on analysis/hypotheses, undermined by SQL verification gap (significant per "logical flaws" criterion). Not "nearly flawless" (deducts to 8.0); minor unclarities prevent 9+.
