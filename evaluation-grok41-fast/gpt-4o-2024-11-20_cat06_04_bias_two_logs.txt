**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting score above 5.0)**: Core identification correct—Group B's log exhibits bias via explicit "+10 Community Boost" in ScoreAdjustment for "Highland Civic Darts Club" members (U001, U003), absent in Group A. Accurate examples (e.g., U003: 695705 approved; parallels to P002/U002 at 710 rejected). Good structure, compares decisions systematically, notes lack of boosts disadvantages Group A (Protected), leading to potential disparate impact. Discusses attributes and column as instructed.
  
- **Major Deductions (strict penalties for inaccuracies/logical flaws)**:
  - **Speculative/inaccurate attribution to LocalResident (-1.5)**: Repeatedly claims "likely implicit favoritism," "benefited... from being LocalResidents," "reinforced by community boost," and "penalized for... non-local residents." **No evidence in logs**: ScoreAdjustment never mentions LocalResident; boosts tied *only* to CommunityGroup. U002 (LocalResident=TRUE, no group) gets **no boost**, directly contradicting claims—logical flaw (ignores counterexample). Correlation  causation; pure speculation violates "consider the influence" by inventing unshown effects.
  - **Factual error on approvals (-0.8)**: "Disproportionately fewer approvals" for Group A is **wrong**—both groups 2/3 approved (A: P001/P003; B: U001/U003). Ignores equal rates; misrepresents systematic differences (B's extra approval for U003's low 695 is key, but not framed as "fewer" in actuality).
  - **Minor unclarities/logical imprecisions (-0.3)**: "Borderline scores (e.g., scores near 720)" mislabels U001 (720 already approves like P001) and U003 (695 low). "Objectively similar PreliminaryScores" overlooks B's lower avg (~708 vs. A's ~723), weakening disparity claim. Overstates Group A "penalized" (neutral process, not penalty).
  - **Overall completeness (-0.2)**: Doesn't explicitly infer approval threshold (~715? from 710 rej/720 app), missing chance to quantify bias precisely (e.g., U003 crosses it solely via boost).

Nearly flawless would require zero speculation, exact facts, no contradictions (10.0). Multiple flaws (2 major) cap at high-7s despite strong core.
