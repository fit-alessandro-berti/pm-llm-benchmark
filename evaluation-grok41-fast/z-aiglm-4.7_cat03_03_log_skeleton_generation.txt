**9.2**

### Rationale (hypercritical evaluation of final answer only):
- **Structure and syntax (flawless, +2.0)**: Exact keys, proper Python dict/sets/tuples, valid literals, all activities covered in `activ_freq`. No syntax errors.
- **activ_freq (flawless, +1.5)**: `{1}` for all perfectly matches mandatory happy-path scenario ("must be processed... correctly assembled, packaged, and shipped"). Sets correct.
- **never_together (flawless, +1.0)**: Empty set() correct; no exclusions described.
- **always_before / always_after (near-flawless, +1.8)**: Direct chain mirrors scenario order (ROCARIPIQCPOGSLDICRP). Definitions precisely matched ((A,B) semantics correct). Redundant with chain but logically enforces precedence/response without gaps/transitives needed. Minor deduction for not including any transitives (e.g., (RP, RO) implied but absent; chain suffices but hyper-strictly incomplete enforcement).
- **directly_follows (strong but flawed, +1.2)**: Enforces rigid sequence matching list order. Correct format/semantics. Deduction: Unrealistic "immediate" (DIC; dispatch handover instantly triggers invoice generation? Scenario implies administrative separation, not log-level direct follow).
- **equivalence (good but arbitrary/flawed, +1.7)**: Semantic pairs tie to scenario (labeldispatch attachment; invoicepayment update). Correct format. Significant deductions: Selective/arbitrary (why GSL-D/IC-RP but omit obvious RO-D/RO-RP "bookend" equivalences for fulfilled orders? No full chain coverage despite all N=1; violates "same occurrences" uniformity without justification. Unidirectional wording ignored, assuming bidir—minor unclarified).

**Total: 9.2**. Nearly flawless execution/coverage, but minor logical flaws (arbitrary selectivity, rigid direct-follows post-D) and missing implied equivalences prevent 10.0. Robust, plausible model overall.
