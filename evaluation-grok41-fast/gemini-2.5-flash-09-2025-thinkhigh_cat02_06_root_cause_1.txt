**10.0**

The response is exemplary: precise, comprehensive, and directly aligned with the task. All time calculations are mathematically accurate (e.g., Case 105: exactly 49h5m; escalation delays verified minute-for-minute). Outliers (102, 104, 105) correctly identified against a logical baseline (101/103), with multipliers approximate but defensible (11–36x spans realistic comparisons to 80–135min baselines). Root causes surgically pinpointed—escalations (with tables quantifying idle wait times), L1 assignment-to-investigate lags (e.g., 104's 3.5h), and cross-day investigation patterns (precisely 19h each, a flawless observation). Explanations causally link factors to cycle time inflation (e.g., idle handoffs as "pure idle time"). Insights tabulated for clarity; recommendations actionable, prioritized, and preventive (e.g., SLOs, triage refinement, shift handoffs), drawing valid inferences from logs (e.g., 105's brief L1 work pre-escalation). No inaccuracies, ambiguities, redundancies, or unsubstantiated claims; structure enhances readability without fluff. Process mining nod adds value without overreach. Utterly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny.
