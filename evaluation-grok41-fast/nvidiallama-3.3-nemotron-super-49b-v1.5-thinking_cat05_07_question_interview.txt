The provided answer delivers a comprehensive, logically organized list of 22 open-ended questions that precisely target the specified goals: uncovering missing details (e.g., Q1, Q5), decision criteria (e.g., Q3, Q13), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q10, Q16), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q11), and exception handling (e.g., Q2, Q17-18). Questions follow the process flow in themed sections, remain strictly conceptual (no SQL or implementation specifics; Q19 probes high-level tools as referenced in the description), and encourage elaboration on nuances like escalations, bottlenecks (Q21), and coordination (Q20). All are non-leading, relevant to the description's elements (e.g., documents, assignments, inspections, audits, multi-regional aspects), and free of inaccuracies, redundancies, or ambiguities. The closing summary reinforces alignment without fluff. Flawless execution.
