**8.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Assessment)
This answer is strong overall—comprehensive integration, correct use of `order_id` as Case ID, logical activity derivation (e.g., per-item "Item Picked", per-shipment "Dispatched"/"Arrived"), accurate timestamp mapping with chronological sorting within cases, excellent enrichment via lookups from Products/Resources tables, relevant additional attributes repeated as case-level data (ideal for process mining), and clear Markdown table. Notes document assumptions well (e.g., per-line events, "Customer" for payments, missing data for 1004). All tables linked correctly via keys (e.g., invoice_id to payments, delivery_id preserved).

**Major Deduction (-1.5 points; significant inaccuracy/incompleteness)**:  
The "Item Picked" event for order 1004 (from Order Lines: `order_id=1004`, `item_id=ITEM-001`, `quantity=5`, `item_picking_date=2024-01-06T08:00:00Z`, `picker_id=WH-002`  "Eva Johnson", "Widget A") is **entirely missing** from the table. This violates core tasks: "Ensure that every event for every `order_id` is included" and "Combine Data... each event row". Notes explicitly state "only creation and **picking** events appear" for 1004, creating inconsistency (notes claim inclusion, table omits). This breaks comprehensiveness; 1004 case is incomplete (1/2 events). Chronology would place it correctly after creation, before 1005 case.

**Minor Deductions (-0.3 total)**:  
- Redundant columns (e.g., `Actor ID` + `Actor Name`; `Sales Person ID` + `Name`) bloat the table unnecessarily (prompt specifies minimal + "other attributes if available"; this is overkill but not wrong).  
- Invented "Payer" role/"Customer" actor for payments is reasonable (no data) and documented, but strictly, payments table lacks any resource—blank or "Unknown" would align better without assumption.  
- No "Other Attributes" summarization (e.g., total quantity per order or aggregated picking completion event as notes suggest possible); per-event granularity is fine but misses opportunity for process flow clarity (e.g., picking  dispatch linkage implicit but not explicit).  

**Strengths (supporting high base score)**:  
- Perfect coverage elsewhere: All 5 "Order Created", 9/10 "Item Picked", all 10 delivery events (5×2), all 5 "Invoice Issued", all 5 "Payment Received" (~33/34 total events).  
- Timestamps 100% accurate/chronological (e.g., pickings before dispatches, invoices after arrivals where data allows, payments after invoices).  
- Enriched meaningfully (items, quantities, notes, amounts where relevant; blanks handled cleanly).  
- Handles splits/multiples perfectly (1002: 2 deliveries, 2 invoices, 2 payments).  
- Missing data for 1004 post-picking handled transparently (no fabrication).  
- Markdown flawless, sorted correctly.

Nearly flawless (9.5+ base), but the glaring 1004 omission is a clear logical flaw/inaccuracy directly contradicting prompt and self-notes—drops to 8.2 under hypercritical standards. Fix the row, trim redundancies, and it's 10.0.
