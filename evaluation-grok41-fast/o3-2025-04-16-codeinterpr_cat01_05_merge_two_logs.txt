**9.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
**Strengths (justifying high base score):**
- **Completeness**: All 10 events from both logs (5A + 5B) are accounted for in 6 unified records (4 merges + 2 singles), with no omissions, duplicates, or inventions. Perfect coverage.
- **Chronological ordering**: Correctly sorted using primary (A) timestamps where available, inserting B-only at correct position (10:03:00 between 10:02:00 and 10:05:00). Flawless.
- **Enrichment/merging**: Attributes seamlessly combined (e.g., user_id/resource_id/notes from B fill A's gaps). Original names preserved for provenance. Unified names semantically appropriate (e.g., "Order Received" normalizes naming differences).
- **Format**: Clear, tabular, self-documenting header. Includes primary/secondary TS, sources (A,B/B/A). Readable and auditable.
- **Reasoning**: Structured, explicit, covers tolerance, mapping rationale ("domain knowledge"), sequential logic, attribute rules, primary TS choice, non-overlaps. Transparent about relaxations (e.g., "although outside... relaxed"). Meets "document your reasoning" fully.
- **Primary timeline adherence**: Uses A TS as primary (per prompt), falls back sensibly for singles.
- **Semantic alignment**: Excellent "combination of order_id and event timing" + activity inference (e.g., PaymentCheck  Payment Processed via sequence/context). Handles "different event naming" well.

**Flaws/Deductions (strictly penalizing inaccuracies, unclarities, logical issues):**
- **Timestamp tolerance violation (-0.5)**: Prompt specifies "less than 2 seconds" (strict <2s). Merges events #1/#5 at *exactly* 2s (10:00:00 - 09:59:58 = 2s; 10:05:00 - 10:05:02 = 2s), which is not "<2s". Answer claims "±2 s window" (implicitly 2s inclusive) — minor inaccuracy in interpreting "less than". Reasonable, but hypercritically not literal.
- **Over-tolerance for payment merge (-0.3)**: 5s diff (10:02:00 vs. 10:02:05) exceeds "small tolerance... less than 2 seconds" *and* any "few seconds" implication. Answer admits "outside the strict window" but merges anyway based on "sequential position" and "names". Logical *but* prompt prioritizes "confidently match" via timing + "if cannot confidently, leave separate". Semantic match strong (sequence perfect, names similar), but stretches "e.g. <2s" example into subjective relaxation — not "nearly flawless" adherence. Names not *perfect* synonyms ("Processed" implies completion; "Check" + "delay" note suggests verification, potential precursor).
- **No unclarities, but minor over-documentation pedantry (-0.0)**: Explanation says "events 1, 2 and 5 were within this window" — technically true under answer's ±2s, but inconsistent with prompt's <2s for #1/#5.

**Overall**: Exceptionally strong (far exceeds basic merge), but tolerance stretches prevent 10.0 "nearly flawless". Logical, comprehensive, production-ready — deducts only for strict non-adherence to example tolerance phrasing. 9.2 reflects "very high" with hypercritical precision.
