**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless, directly and correctly addressing every requirement of the prompt with precise DuckDB SQL leveraging native `LIST` aggregation for ordered sequences, exact equality joins on lists, proper top-K selection via `ORDER BY ... LIMIT K`, case filtering via joins, and final output of all original events (`el.*`) exclusively from qualifying cases. 

- **Completeness**: Fully implements steps 1–4: ordered per-case variants (`LIST(activity ORDER BY timestamp ASC)`), grouping/counting (`GROUP BY variant`), top-K ranking (`ORDER BY num_cases DESC LIMIT 5`), and filtered event return.
- **Correctness**: DuckDB-specific features (ordered `LIST`, list equality, CTE `LIMIT`) work exactly as described; handles sequences with duplicates/ties implicitly correctly; excludes non-top-K cases via `INNER JOIN`.
- **Clarity**: Well-structured CTEs, explanatory table, strategy diagram, K-replacement note, and optional ranked extension with tie-handling (`DENSE_RANK() ... QUALIFY`) enhance without distracting.
- **Robustness**: No schema assumptions beyond prompt; logical ordering in output; no hacks (e.g., no string concatenation).
- **Nitpicks (none score-deducting)**: Single `K=5` literal (as noted); `ORDER BY` alias is DuckDB-valid; ties arbitrary in main query (addressed optionally, prompt-unspecified).
