This answer is flawless. It correctly identifies all three distinct cases using the unique patient_age + patient_gender combinations (45M, 62F, 28M), which are unambiguous anchors. Every event (1-18) is assigned exactly once with no omissions, overlaps, or misassignments. Within each case:

- Timestamps are strictly increasing and temporally logical.
- Activity sequences follow realistic hospital workflows (e.g., register  triage  tests  consult/diagnosis  treatment  discharge).
- Departments are consistent (ER for Cases 1/2, Surgery for Case 3).
- Resources and additional_info align perfectly (e.g., Dr. Lee bridges Surgery/ER logically across cases; X-ray precedes fracture diagnosis; lab request  completion  diagnosis  prescription).
- No contradictions (e.g., insurance or triage codes are case-specific where present).

Presentation is crystal-clear: structured cases with descriptive summaries, full event details quoted verbatim, and interpretive notes that enhance without speculating inaccurately. Zero inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. This is a perfect solution to the task.
