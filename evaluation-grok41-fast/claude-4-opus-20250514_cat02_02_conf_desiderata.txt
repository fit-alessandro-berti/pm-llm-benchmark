**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
While the answer is well-structured, comprehensive in coverage, and mostly accurate, it contains **critical flaws** that prevent a higher score under strict criteria. Even partial successes do not offset omissions or errors. Breakdown:

#### Strengths (Supporting ~8.0 baseline, adjusted down):
- **Excellent structure**: Mirrors task perfectly (1,2,3 sections + summary). Clear, tabular-like formatting with bullet points for violations.
- **Correct core identifications**:
  - Case 1: Fully normative compliant; minor desiderata note on follow-up.
  - Case 3: Normative compliant; correctly flags 2+ desiderata issues (late credit ~49h >24h, late inform ~51h >48h, no follow-up).
  - Case 2 normative: Correctly flags **two** key violations (Risk before Credit; Finalize after Reject).
- **Good interpretations (Task 3)**: Plausible justifications (e.g., system error, backlog, weekends for delays). Recommendations practical.
- **Clarifies desiderata severity**: Consistently notes as "minor"/"suboptimal" (e.g., "minor desiderata gap").
- **General observations insightful**: Notes missing Inform in rejects and absent follow-ups across cases.

#### Major Deductions (Hypercritical: -2.8 total):
1. **Critical omission in Task 1 (Normative Violations) -1.5 points**:
   - Case 2 **skips "Inform Applicant" entirely** after Decision (09:30  Finalize 10:00  Close 10:30).
   - Strict rules explicitly state: "Following the loan decision, the **must** be informed of the outcome." Sequence mandates **Decision  Inform  [branch]  Close** for **both** approve/reject.
   - This is a **third clear normative violation** (skipping mandatory step). Answer aware (notes in desiderata/general), but fails to list/explain in **Task 1 normative section**. Misclassifies as non-strict (logical flaw; undermines "strict rules" distinction).
   - Result: Case 2 analysis incomplete; task not fully met.

2. **Factual inaccuracy in Task 2 (Desiderata) -0.8 points**:
   - Case 2: "Credit Check within 20 minutes of application" – **false**. App at 08:00, Credit at **09:00** (60 minutes, not 20). Misread table (08:20 was Risk). Claims "timing requirements met" despite this and **no Inform** (violates "promptly within 48h of decision" – impossible without Inform).
   - Mislabeling "Desiderata Compliance" for Case 2 (despite notes) vs. "Multiple...Violations" for Case 3 = unclear/inconsistent.

3. **Minor unclarities/logical flaws -0.5 points**:
   - Case 1 desiderata: Calls "Fully Compliant" but immediately notes follow-up gap – self-contradictory phrasing.
   - No explicit desiderata failure list for **all cases** on follow-up (encouraged pre-close; missing in **all 3**). Notes variably but doesn't standardize (e.g., Case 2 "compliance" ignores it fully).
   - Case 2 sequence nuance: Decision after late Credit, but Risk precedes **both** (reinforces violation, but not deepened).

#### Overall:
- **85% accurate** but flaws are **not minor** (omission alters violation count; factual error erodes credibility; unclarities confuse).
- **Nearly flawless requires zero gaps** – this has 3+ issues impacting core tasks. 7.2 reflects strong execution docked strictly for precision failures. Lower (e.g., 5) if structure ignored; higher (8+) impossible due to Task 1 miss.
