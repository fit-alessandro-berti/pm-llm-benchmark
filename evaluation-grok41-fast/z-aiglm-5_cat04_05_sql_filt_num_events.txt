**10.0**

The provided final SQL query is correct, precise, and fully satisfies the prompt's requirements without any additions, omissions, inaccuracies, or inefficiencies impacting correctness. It accurately identifies qualifying `case_id`s via a standard subquery with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`, then returns exactly the full events (`SELECT *`) for those cases only. The explanation is clear, concise, and logically mirrors the query's operation with no errors or ambiguities. This is a flawless solution in standard SQL (fully compatible with DuckDB).
