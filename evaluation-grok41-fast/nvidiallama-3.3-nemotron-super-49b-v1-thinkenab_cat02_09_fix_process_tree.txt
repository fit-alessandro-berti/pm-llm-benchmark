**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless: it precisely identifies the core issue (parallel block enabling invalid orders), delivers an exact corrected model that enforces the required strict sequence via nested SEQUENCE operators while retaining all activities and mirroring the original structure, and provides a clear, accurate explanation of conformance without extraneous elements, choices, or flaws. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical gaps.
