**10.0**

The graded answer is nearly flawless. It precisely identifies all normative violations (Case 2: order swap, post-rejection documentation, missing Inform Applicant; Cases 1 and 3 compliant) with exact rule citations and log timestamps. Desiderata failures are accurately pinpointed per case (timings calculated correctly, Follow-up missing in all, severity clarified as low/moderate/suboptimal without conflating with strict rules). Interpretations are plausible, context-aware (e.g., calendar-verified weekend justification for Case 3), and tied to behaviors without excusing violations. Structure is logical, professional, comprehensive, and free of inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws. Minor phrasing like "Application Credit Check" is a trivial typo with zero impact on clarity or correctness.
