The provided answer is nearly flawless: the SQL query is logically correct, efficient, and precisely achieves the task using a standard CTE + INNER JOIN pattern that works perfectly in DuckDB. It correctly groups by `case_id`, applies the `HAVING` filter for `COUNT(*) <= 6` (accurately excluding >6 events), and returns the full `e.*` for qualifying cases without duplication or omission. The optional `ORDER BY` enhances usability without altering correctness. The explanation is clear, structured, and free of errors or ambiguities, directly mapping to the steps. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or unnecessary assumptions (e.g., column existence is per spec). Under hypercritical scrutiny, zero deductions warranted.
