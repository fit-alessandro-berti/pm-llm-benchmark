**9.5**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Near-Flawless Aspects)**:
  - **Merged Log Output**: Perfectly structured as a chronological JSON list (sorted correctly by primary `timestamp`). All 7 events included without omission or duplication. Attributes fully enriched (all from Log B integrated; nulls for missing). Both timestamps preserved for merged events. `source` field elegantly indicates origin. Primary timestamp choice (Log A prioritized) aligns precisely with "primary timeline" requirement.
  - **Chronological Order**: Impeccable—e.g., 10:02:00Z (A-only) before 10:02:05Z (B-only), integrating seamlessly.
  - **Handling Non-Overlaps**: `Quality Check` (B-only), `Item Delivered` (A-only) correctly retained with origin indicated.
  - **Reasoning Documentation**: Exhaustive, structured per event with exact diffs, criteria restatement, conflict explanations (e.g., 5s exceeds tolerance), and handling notes (timestamps, attributes, sorting). Transparent and comprehensive.
  - **Matching Logic**: Semantic awareness implicit (e.g., no forced merge of payment events despite similarity, sticking to timing/order_id). No over-merging.

- **Minor Deductions (Strict/Hypercritical)**:
  - **Tolerance Interpretation (Primary Flaw, -0.5)**: Prompt specifies "less than 2 seconds" (strictly <2s). Answer uses "within 2 seconds" (2s), merging exactly 2s diffs (Order Received: exactly 2s; Item Shipped: exactly 2s). This is a logical inaccuracy—hypercritically, those should arguably be non-confident (separate), as "less than" excludes equality. While "e.g." allows flexibility and matches are intuitively correct, strict adherence violated; not "nearly flawless."
  - **No Other Issues**: No unclarities (e.g., fields self-explanatory), no logical flaws (e.g., no semantic overreach), no missing events/attributes, JSON valid, reasoning corrects any think-step ambiguities.

This is exceptionally strong—deduction only for the precise tolerance mismatch; otherwise 10.0.
