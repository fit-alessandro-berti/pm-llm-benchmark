**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**:
  - **Task 1 (Outlier Identification)**: Flawlessly identifies cases 102, 104, 105 as significantly longer (correctly computed durations in minutes/hours with precise math matching manual verification: 1510 min 25.17h, 1450 min 24.17h, 2945 min 49.08h; normals <140 min accurate benchmark). Summary table clear, LaTeX-formatted, highlights key delays per case.
  - **Task 2 (Root Causes)**: Comprehensively lists factors (escalations in 102/105 only—correct; long waits/overnight gaps in all three with specific 19h examples—precise; extended triage/assign in some like 104—mostly accurate; repeated investigations in 105—spot-on; shift gaps—well-evidenced). Table format excellent with evidence linkage.
  - **Task 3 (Explanation & Recommendations)**: Causal model with \(W_i = \Delta t_i\), \(C = \sum W_i + \sum T_i\) logically sound (correctly shows waits dominate cycle time inflation). Recommendations practical/actionable (SLA thresholds, automation, cross-shifts, KB updates) with direct ties to log patterns. Python snippet elegant/relevant (correctly computes total span via `diff().sum()`; lines <80 chars). Bottom line concise synthesis.
  - Overall: Structured (tables, sections, bullets), data-driven, no major logical flaws, covers all tasks exhaustively.

- **Weaknesses (deductions for strictness; total -1.8 pts)**:
  - **Inaccuracies/Unclarities (-0.8)**: Root causes table claims "Cases 104 & -106 exceed [triage/assign >45-50 mins]"—**typo: no Case 106 exists** (means 105, but 105 triage=10 min/assign=25 min, not exceeding; only 104 does at 40/30 min). Minor speculation like "+10–20% overhead" unsubstantiated but tolerable. "Typical <140 min" ok but average normals=(135+80)/2=107.5 min (slight overstate).
  - **Sloppiness/Typos (-0.6)**: "14 000 hrs." in evidence—**obvious typo for 14:00**, risks confusion. Weird en-dashes/non-breaking spaces (e.g., "106", "19hr") rendering artifacts. LaTeX quirks like `{\rm min}` archaic/unnecessary.
  - **Minor Logical/Completeness Gaps (-0.4)**: Triage delays overstated (not consistent across all outliers: 102/105 short). No explicit avg total time or % outlier computation (e.g., mean=1108 min, median=135 min). Python assumes unshown `df` structure (trivial). Re-escalation in 105 not "back-to-Level-1" (stays Level-2)—minor misphrasing.

Nearly flawless in substance/analysis (would be 10.0 absent polish issues), but hypercritical lens demands deduction for any inaccuracy/typo/clarity hiccup as specified. 8.2 reflects excellence with targeted penalties.
