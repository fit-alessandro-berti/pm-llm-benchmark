**3.0**

The final process tree fails to model Case 3 accurately due to a critical misunderstanding of the loop operator `* (RMI, RMI)`. This loop produces only odd numbers of consecutive `RMI` events (1, 3, 5, ...), as it follows the semantics "execute A, then [exit OR (B then A again)]", yielding traces like `RMI`, `RMI RMI RMI`, etc., followed by `VF`. Case 3 requires exactly **two** `RMI` events (`RMI RMI VF`), which is impossible. This results in zero fitness for Case 3, violating the requirement to capture "possible repetitions of requesting missing info and re-validation." Cases 1 and 2 fit, but incomplete fitness disqualifies high scores. The `X` with `tau` correctly handles skipping, and the overall sequence is syntactically valid/simple, but the logical flaw in the loop (evident even in the explanation claiming "loop executed twice" produces two `RMI`) is fatal under strict evaluation. Minor: full activity labels match the log precisely.
