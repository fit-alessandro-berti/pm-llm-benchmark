**Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):**

- **Comprehensiveness**: Covers every task (A-I, E1/E2), all gateways (XOR for type/feasible/approval/granted; AND split/join for parallels), purposes (inferred logically and explicitly stated for each), path differences (detailed sections 3A/3B + table), convergence (post-D/E1 merge at approval XOR), loops (H back to D/E1 with path-specificity, enabling re-approval iteration), and triggers (approval if "Yes" at XOR; rework if approval denied). Early termination for infeasible custom correctly noted as negative end via E2 (no G/I). Task I correctly placed post-G for all successful paths. No omissions.

- **Accuracy**: Perfect match to diagram logic—no misinterpretation of flows, loops, or joins. Distinguishes rejection end from success path. Parallel AND/gateways precisely explained (split concurrent, join on completion). No invented steps.

- **Clarity/Unclarity**: Structured sections, numbered flows, table for quick contrasts/summaries, bolding, and conclusion tie-in make it exemplary. No ambiguities; every diagram element unpacked.

- **Logical Flaws**: None. Loop logic sound (path-aware back to D/E1, then re-converge to approval). Convergence accurate (only successful paths merge). No contradictions.

- **Minor Deductions (-0.2 total)**: 
  - Table infers approval triggers as "high-value or risky orders" (reasonable but unstated in diagram/question—slight extrapolation vs. pure "triggered if Yes at XOR gateway").
  - Purposes include helpful examples (e.g., B1 "order completeness, pricing")—logical inferences but not diagram-explicit; hypercritically, could stick strictly to labels.
  
Nearly flawless; deductions minimal for non-core additions. Any stricter interpretation (e.g., zero inferences) would ignore evaluative context.
