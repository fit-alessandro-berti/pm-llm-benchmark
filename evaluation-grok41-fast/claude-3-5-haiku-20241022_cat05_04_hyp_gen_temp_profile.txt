**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (supporting ~6/10 baseline):** Structure is clear and independent (no meta-references to instructions). Identifies 3/4 key anomalies from the profile (EN, RP, PN). Hypotheses are plausible, business-relevant, and tied to anomalies. Two SQL queries (1 and 3) are functionally sound for verification: Query 1 correctly isolates short EN gaps per claim; Query 3 usefully correlates long PN delays with claim_type/region (minor nit: correlated subquery inefficient but works; assumes `resource` casts to `adjuster_id` implicitly). Covers prompt tasks logically.
  
- **Major Deductions (strict penalties for flaws):**
  - **Incomplete anomaly coverage (-1.5):** Misses AC (2-hour avg Assign-to-Close, highlighted as suspicious for premature closure without intermediates). Only partial match to example anomalies.
  - **Inaccuracy in labeling (-1.0):** First anomaly header/body repeatedly calls EN "Approve-to-Notify Transition" (Approve is P, not E). Confusing/misleading; undermines precision.
  - **Critically flawed SQL Query 2 (-2.0):** Intended for RP consistency but *fundamentally broken*. Subquery `GROUP BY c.claim_type` (without `claim_id`) computes *global* MIN(R)/MAX(P) across *all claims* of each type, not per-claim intervals. Result: garbage output (e.g., avg ~submission of first-ever claim of type). No per-claim aggregation before outer AVG/STDEV. Unusable for verification—direct violation of task.
  - **Logical/precision gaps in queries (-0.5):** Q1/Q3 use MAX-MIN assuming single events/sequence; fails if multiples/out-of-order (common in event logs). No Z-score filtering (e.g., >avg + 2*STDEV); arbitrary thresholds (<300s, >5 days). No AC query despite anomaly. Q2 "across Claim Types" ignores customer/region per prompt suggestion.
  - **Minor unclarities (-0.0, no further deduct as "significantly lower" already applied):** Hypotheses generic/not exhaustive (e.g., no data-entry/system-error ties from prompt examples). No explicit ZETA deviation calc.

Nearly flawless requires 100% accurate/complete SQL, all anomalies, zero mislabels. This is solid effort (~60% effective) but derailed by pivotal SQL bug + incompleteness = mid-grade.
