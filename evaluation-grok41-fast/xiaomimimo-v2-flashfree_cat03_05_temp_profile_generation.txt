**8.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is strong overall—comprehensive, well-structured, plausible for a supply chain context, Python-valid, and fulfills the "representative subset" requirement with ~24 pairs spanning direct (9), skip-1 (7), and long-range (8) relations, demonstrating complexity across multiple steps. Times are in seconds, stdevs are positive/reasonable (~25-50% of avg, scaling with distance), and estimates align broadly with real-world logistics (e.g., 1-week lead times, hour-scale manufacturing). Comments aid clarity and show summation logic.

However, **strict deductions for inaccuracies/logical flaws** (even minor ones significantly lower the score, per instructions):
- **Calculation inconsistencies (major theme, multiple instances)**: Long-range avgs often deviate from sums of component pairs without justification beyond "estimation." Examples:
  - SS-RC: 777600 (9d) vs. SS-OP (1d) + OP-RC (7d) = 691200 (8d). Comment "~9 days" glosses over ~12% error.
  - QI-PT: 64800 (18h) vs. QI-CA (8h) + CA-PT (12h) = 72000 (20h). ~10% under.
  - CA-WS: 86400 (24h) vs. CA-PT+PT-PK+PK-WS = 68400 (~19h). ~26% over.
  - QI-DT: 237600 (~2.75d) vs. sum ~270000 (~3.1d). ~12% under.
  - SS-DT: 950400 (11d) vs. full prefix sum ~975600 (~11.3d). Minor (~3%), but cumulative.
  - **SS-AS: Critical flaw**—2592000 (30d) identical to DT-AS, ignoring ~11d prefix (SS-DT). Should be ~41d; contradicts own logic/comments. Clear copy-paste/logical error.
- **Stdev propagation**: Not rigorously derived (e.g., not (sum variances) or similar); scales roughly but arbitrarily (e.g., SS-AS stdev matches DT-AS exactly, WS-AS inflated inconsistently).
- **Completeness**: Representative, but uneven—overrepresents late-stage pairs; misses key mids like OP-DT, RC-DT, CA-DT, QI-AS (arbitrary subset, minor).
- **Clarity/unclarity**: Comments helpful but expose flaws (e.g., "~" approximations inconsistent with exact mismatches). No units in dict (fine, implied seconds), but comments mix "~days" and precise hours.
- **No other syntax/logic issues**: All pairs forward-ordered, no invalids/backwards, no non-numeric times.

**Scoring rationale**: 10.0 = zero flaws (perfect sums, full consistency). Base 9.5 for structure/coverage/plausibility, deduct 0.4 for multiple calc mismatches, 0.6 for SS-AS error, 0.3 for stdev arbitrariness, +0.2 partial credit for ~ comments acknowledging estimation. Not "nearly flawless" due to ~6 quantifiable flaws.
