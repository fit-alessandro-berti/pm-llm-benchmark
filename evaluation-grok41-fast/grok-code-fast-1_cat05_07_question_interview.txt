The provided answer produces an exemplary list of 13 targeted, open-ended questions that precisely align with the prompt's requirements. They systematically uncover missing details (e.g., common documentation issues, additional database attributes), probe decision criteria (e.g., weighting for manager assignment, repair escalation), clarify roles/responsibilities (e.g., PM vs. leasing agent, compliance vs. financial reviews), verify timing/sequencing (e.g., screening sequence, bottlenecks), and address exceptions (e.g., special insurance handling). Thematic organization enhances clarity without adding extraneous content. All questions are conceptually focused, grounded in the process description, free of any requests for SQL or implementation details, logically flawless, accurate, and free of unclarities or inaccuracies. No flaws detected.
