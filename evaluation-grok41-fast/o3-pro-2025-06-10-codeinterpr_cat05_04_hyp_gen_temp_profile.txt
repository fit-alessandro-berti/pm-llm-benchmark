**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Overall Strengths (Supporting High Base Score):**
- **Task Coverage (Perfect):** Fully addresses all 3 tasks independently without referencing instructions. Identifies key anomalies (R-P low STDEV, P-N long/variable, A-C fast, E-N fast) matching the model, adds insightful "general imbalance." Hypotheses are creative, business-plausible (e.g., batch jobs, backlogs, auto-closures), and tied to anomalies. SQL proposals verify deviations, correlate with adjusters/resources/types/regions, and suggest next steps—exceeds minimum.
- **Clarity & Structure (Excellent):** Concise, scannable (numbered anomalies, bulleted hypotheses, labeled queries, interpretation guide). No fluff, professional tone.
- **Insightfulness (Outstanding):** Hypotheses go beyond generic (e.g., "nightly batch" for rigid STDEV). Queries target specific anomalies with Z-score-like thresholds (e.g., ±3). Interpretation links outputs to actions (e.g., interview adjusters).

**Deducting Factors (Strict Penalties for Inaccuracies/Flaws; Total -1.8):**
- **Minor Incompleteness (-0.3):** Misses explicit note on other model pairs (e.g., R-A normal, but A-C implies skipping E/P/N—implied but not exhaustive). General imbalance insightful but speculates "STDEV for E-P not in model" without querying it directly until E.
- **Hypotheses Speculation (-0.2):** Some stretch logic (e.g., "duplicate claims merged" for A-C not directly inferable from temporal data; "Evaluate timestamped late when report uploaded" assumes undocumented behavior).
- **SQL Logical/Accuracy Flaws (-1.0 total; significant deductions):**
  | Query | Issue | Severity | Penalty |
  |-------|--------|----------|---------|
  | A | Repeated EXTRACT in WHERE (inefficient, but correct). Uses fixed 3*STDEV=3h (10800s) reasonably, but hardcoded 90000s/3600 ignores dynamic computation. Assumes single R/P per claim (MIN handles multiples OK). | Minor inefficiency | -0.1 |
  | B | Perfect (filters <2h matching avg 2h anomaly). | None | 0 |
  | C | MAX(resource) arbitrary if multiple P events (should be MIN/ANY). Unneeded JOIN claims. >3 days fixed (ignores model's 7d avg/2d STDEV). | Minor logic | -0.1 |
  | **D** | **Major flaw:** LEFT JOIN ce2 on 'A' duplicates rows if multiple Assign per claim (common in retries), causing COUNT(*) to overcount claims and AVG(hrs_pn) to weight by multiplicity—**inaccurate aggregation**. GROUP BY doesn't fix pre-aggregate duplication. | Logical error | -0.4 |
  | D | Assumes `resource` (VARCHAR) holds numeric `adjuster_id` for `::INTEGER` cast/join—**schema violation risk** (resource could be name/email per schema; query fails at runtime if non-numeric). No fallback (e.g., JOIN on name). Correlates assigner region (good), but WHERE >72h fixed, not -based. | Assumption inaccuracy | -0.3 |
  | E | Perfect for bottleneck check. | None | 0 |
- **General SQL Issues (-0.3):** No handling for claims missing activities (implicitly filtered OK, but could add HAVING COUNT(activity)>X). No ZETA factor use (prompt mentions, but not required). PostgreSQL-specific (EXTRACT/EPOCH/INTERVAL correct), but no indexes/error-handling notes.
- **Unclarities (-0.2):** Query D's ce2/ad joins vague ("if resource stores ID"—self-admits assumption). No sample outputs or edge-case explanations. "Minutes_a_to_c" in B SELECT inconsistent units (others hours/seconds).

**Why Not Higher/Lower?**
- 10.0/9.5 impossible: Not "nearly flawless" (SQL duplication/assumption flaws are logical errors, not cosmetic).
- >8.0 earned: Flaws minor-to-medium (fixable with sub-CTE for unique adjuster, resource validation); core value intact, no crashes on valid data, covers prompt exhaustively.
- Strict calibration: Base 10  -1.8 for ~5 issues (weighted by impact).
