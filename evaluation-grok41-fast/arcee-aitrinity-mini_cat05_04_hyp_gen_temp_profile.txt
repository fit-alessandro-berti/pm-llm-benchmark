**4.2**

### Justification (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Anomalies Identification (Strong, ~9/10)**: Accurately flags key issues (RP low STDEV rigidity, PN long/high variability, AC fast skips, EN unrealistically tight). Minor flaws: Slight numerical inaccuracies (AC STDEV as "70m" vs. exact 60m; EN emphasizes STDEV over avg but still valid). Covers most profile entries without extraneous invention. No reference to instructions—independent presentation.
  
- **Hypotheses Generation (Good, ~8/10)**: Plausible, process-aligned explanations (manual bypasses, bottlenecks, batch autos, misconfigs). Ties directly to anomalies without overreaching schema limits. Logical and varied, but lacks depth on some (e.g., no explicit link to regions/customers despite prompt suggestion).

- **SQL Verification Queries (Abysmal, ~1/10)**: Core failure—queries are syntactically invalid, logically broken, and non-executable in PostgreSQL. Fatal issues:
  | Query | Key Flaws |
  |-------|-----------|
  | 1 (RP) | - Nonsensical `TIMESTAMP '2099-01-01' + INTERVAL '25 hours'` (arbitrary base, irrelevant subtraction).<br>- `pl` subquery groups by `event_id` (unique per event, breaks pairing logic).<br>- JOINs on `event_id` mismatch R/P events; `pl.last_timestamp < ep.timestamp` redundant/wrong for future P.<br>- `resource_info` undefined.<br>- Won't compute per-claim RP diffs correctly. |
  | 2 (AC) | - Multiple cartesian-risk JOINs without timestamp ordering (`LAG/LEAD` or windowing needed).<br>- `LAST_VALUE(pl.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE pl.activity = 'A')`—`pl.activity='P'` in JOIN/WHERE, so FILTER null; requires `OVER()` clause (syntax error).<br>- Requires E/P existence via JOINs but filters `eval_skip_gap IS NULL` (inconsistent).<br>- `poly_free_timestamp` undefined purpose. |
  | 3 (PN) | - `NOTIFY_TIMESTAMP`/`APPROVE_TIMESTAMP` undefined (no subquery/aliases for per-claim max timestamps).<br>- `adjusters.adjuster_id = claim_events.resource_id`—type mismatch (INT vs. VARCHAR `resource`).<br>- WHERE on undefined vars  parse error. |
  - **No coverage** of Z-score outliers (prompt-implied via avg±STDEV*ZETA).<br>- **Missing correlations**: Vague "Key Checks" mention adjusters/claim_type but provide **zero SQL**; invents `level_of_service` (absent in schema).<br>- No simple, correct queries (e.g., basic per-claim `LAG` or self-joins for diffs, filtered by `(diff - avg)/stdev > 2`).

- **Overall Structure/Clarity (Mediocre, ~5/10)**: Concise, independent presentation. But verbose anomalies (repeats phrasing), incomplete (ignores some pairs like RE/EC), no ZETA integration.

**Why not lower?** Anomalies/hypotheses solid; attempts complexity (correlations attempted). **Why not higher?** Queries unusable (strict penalty for "verification methods using SQL"—primary task); minor numerical slips; incomplete coverage. Nearly flawless requires executable, precise, comprehensive SQL matching schema/profile exactly.
