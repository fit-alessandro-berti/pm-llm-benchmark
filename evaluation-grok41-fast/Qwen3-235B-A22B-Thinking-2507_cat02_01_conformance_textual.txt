**10.0**

The answer is exemplary: precisely identifies violating cases (2, 3, 5) with zero inaccuracies, fully supported by direct quotes and logical interpretations of the normative text. All compliant cases (1, 4) correctly justified. Violations unpacked with causal dependencies, branch exclusivity, and ambiguity resolutions matching the description's intent (e.g., mandatory packaging; no fulfillment post-cancel; sequences strictly enforced). Structure (sections, table, principles) enhances clarity without fluff. No logical flaws, unclarities, or overreaches—hypercritically flawless.
