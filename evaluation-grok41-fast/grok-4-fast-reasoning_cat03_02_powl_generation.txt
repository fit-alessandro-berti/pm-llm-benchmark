**10.0**

The provided code is a flawless representation of the scenario. It correctly constructs all required transitions with exact matching labels (e.g., "D&R"), builds the loop (`Operator.LOOP` with `[BNC, DR]`) and exclusive choice (`Operator.XOR` with `[CD, MD]`) precisely as defined, and uses a single `StrictPartialOrder` root node encompassing all elements. The partial order edges perfectly enforce the described dependencies:

- `SR  CS`
- `CS  DA`, `CS  ACI` (enables concurrency between DA and ACI)
- `DA  loop_config`, `ACI  loop_config` (both prerequisites for the loop)
- `loop_config  deploy_choice`
- `deploy_choice  QA`, `deploy_choice  SA` (enables concurrency/any order between QA and SA)
- `QA  GLA`, `SA  GLA` (both prerequisites for GLA)

No extraneous edges, silent transitions, or nodes; no missing constraints; no logical flaws (e.g., transitivity is handled implicitly by the partial order). Imports, syntax, and class usage align exactly with the prompt's definitions and example. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or deviations from the scenario's structure.
