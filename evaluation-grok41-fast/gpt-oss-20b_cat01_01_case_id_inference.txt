**6.0**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Major Inaccuracy (Primary Deduction: -3.0 points)**: Event 7 (X-ray imaging, 08:15:42Z, Radiology, **45 M**, left_leg) is unambiguously part of Case C-A (45 M, ER fracture pathway, logically post-triage #4 at 08:10:50Z and pre-diagnosis #12 at 08:23:10Z). It is **entirely omitted** from the C-A listing and not assigned to any case. Total events grouped: 4 (C-A) + 7 (C-B) + 6 (C-C) = 17/18. This leaves an event ungrouped, failing the core task of fully inferring groupings for **all** events. False claim in C-A section ("All other activities involving a 45-year-old male are absent") directly contradicts the data.
- **Incomplete/Partial Coverage (Deduction: -0.5 points)**: No comprehensive mapping of **all 18 lines** to cases (e.g., no single table or exhaustive list). C-A has a partial/messy table; C-B/C-C use informal code blocks. Readers must infer unlisted events, creating unclarity.
- **Formatting and Clarity Issues (Deduction: -0.5 points)**: Tables/code blocks are inconsistent, malformed (e.g., C-A row 12 has run-on text "*Dr.* Lee – ER – **45 M**  **CA**"; non-breaking spaces/em-dashes disrupt readability). Deduction #4 vaguely alludes to "ER  Radiology" shifts without applying it to list #7.
- **Strengths (No Added Penalty)**: Correctly identifies 3 unique cases via demographics (age/gender signatures). All **17 grouped events** are accurately assigned. Logical flows, temporal cohesion, and clinical pathway reasoning are sound. No wrong assignments or invented cases.
- **Why Not Lower?** 17/18 correct + solid logic prevents <6.0 (not random failure). **Why Not Higher?** Omission of even **one event** + false statement = significant inaccuracy per "utmost strictness"; not "nearly flawless" (flawless requires 18/18 perfect grouping + clean presentation). Equivalent to 94% accuracy, but strict rubric demands perfection for 9-10.
