**9.2**

The answer is excellent overall—comprehensive, well-structured with helpful tables and sections, accurate in describing purposes (reasonably inferred from task names), gateway meanings (XOR exclusive, AND parallel with join), path convergences (after D/E1 to approval gateway), loops (path-specific back to D or E1, re-entering approval), standard/custom differences (validation depth, early custom exit), and triggers (G4 for approval, G5-No for rework). It fully addresses the question without omissions or major inventions.

Minor deductions for:
- **Unclarity/logical flaw in D table structure** (0.5 pt): Path 4b ("No Approval"  G) is sequenced linearly after G5, implying it's post-approval denial/grant, which misaligns visually with parallel branching from G4-No. G5-Yes  G is not explicitly rowed there (implied later in E), risking brief reader confusion despite textual fixes.
- **Slight overgeneralization** (0.3 pt): Overview says "both paths converge" post-validation without immediately reiterating custom early-end exception (noted elsewhere but could be tighter).

Nearly flawless; flaws are presentational/minor, not factual, but strict rubric demands deduction.
