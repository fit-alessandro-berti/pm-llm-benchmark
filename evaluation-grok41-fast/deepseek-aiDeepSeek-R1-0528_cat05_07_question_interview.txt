The provided answer is exceptionally strong: it delivers a well-organized, categorized list of 20+ targeted, open-ended questions that precisely align with the prompt's goals (uncovering missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, and exception handling). All questions deepen conceptual understanding without referencing SQL, code, or implementation details. They are phrased conversationally to elicit elaboration (e.g., "Could you walk us through...", "What’s the typical timeframe...", "How are disagreements... resolved?"), directly reference process elements from the description, and probe logical extensions like edge cases (e.g., repeated inspection failures, mid-lease acquisitions) without fabricating unrelated scenarios.

**Hypercritical deductions (total -0.2):**
- Minor redundancy: Categories 3 (Roles) and 4 (Exceptions) slightly overlap in authority probes (e.g., compliance halt authority vs. custom clause approval), but this is negligible as it reinforces key themes without repetition in questions.
- One question in 7 ("For properties with existing tenants") assumes a potential variation not explicitly in the description ("new rental property"), risking a very slight overreach into unprompted speculation; however, it validly tests "exceptions" and process adaptability.
- No inaccuracies, logical flaws, unclarities, or off-topic elements; structure enhances usability without verbosity.

This is nearly flawless—comprehensive, precise, and strategically sequenced for an interview flow.
