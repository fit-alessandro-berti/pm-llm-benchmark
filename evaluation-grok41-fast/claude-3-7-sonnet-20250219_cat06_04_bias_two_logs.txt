**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**: 
  - Accurately identifies the core bias: preferential "+10 Community Boost" score adjustments exclusively in Group B's log (for cases with "Highland Civic Darts Club"), absent in Group A, leading to disparate outcomes (e.g., U003 approved at adjusted 705 despite P002 rejection at 710).
  - Correctly links to required factors: LocalResident (TRUE only in B, enabling community boosts), CommunityGroup (proxy for boost), ScoreAdjustment (+10 only in B).
  - Discusses systematic differences effectively: lower effective approval threshold for B (U003 at 705 approved vs. P002 at 710 rejected; U003's original 695 "likely" rejected without boost).
  - Structure is clear (sections, bullet points, conclusion), evidence-based, and comprehensive.
  - No major factual errors; correctly notes not all B get boost (e.g., U002 mirrors P002 rejection).

- **Flaws/Deductions (strict penalties for minor issues)**:
  - **Unclarity in direct identification (-0.4)**: Question explicitly asks "Identify **which log** exhibits bias". Answer implies Group B's log (via "Group B appears to benefit") but never states "Group B's log exhibits bias" or equivalent. Hypercritical: this omits precise phrasing, forcing inference.
  - **Missed stronger evidence/logical depth (-0.2)**: Notes U003 (695705 approved) vs. P002 (710 rejected) but doesn't highlight the illogic (705 < 710 yet approved), which proves *even stronger* bias (inconsistent thresholds). Treats as "boost over threshold" without noting anomaly; minor logical gap.
  - **Minor overgeneralization (-0.1)**: "It only benefits members of Group B (all LocalResident = TRUE)"—accurate in data, but boost ties to *CommunityGroup*, not LocalResident alone (U002 TRUE but no boost). Slight imprecision implies direct causation.
  - **Unnecessary speculation (-0.1)**: "Suggests a geographic or residency-based discrimination"—true inference but "discrimination" is loaded; data shows correlation, not explicit causation (minor overreach).

Nearly flawless (evidence-driven, no contradictions), but minor unclarity/logical gaps warrant deduction from 10.0 per "utmost strictness" and "even minor issues significantly lower score". Scores 9.5+ only for zero issues.
