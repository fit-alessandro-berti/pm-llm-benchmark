The provided answer delivers exactly 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions directly derived from the described supply chain process. Each question precisely targets insights (e.g., #14 on analytics tools), potential issues (e.g., #4 on JIT fluctuations, #8 on geopolitics), improvement strategies (e.g., #2 on supplier risks, #16 on inventory visibility), and decision implications (e.g., #3 on transport trade-offs, #7 on currency hedging). All are clearly phrased, logically sound, relevant to the process elements (R&D, suppliers, assembly, logistics, compliance, digital systems, sustainability), and free of inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or extraneous content like SQL. No violations of the prompt.
