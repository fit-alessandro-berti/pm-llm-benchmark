The provided answer is flawless. It correctly identifies exactly three distinct cases based on the unique patient demographics (age/gender combinations: 45M, 62F, 28M), which are unambiguous anchors, cross-verified perfectly with matching attributes (e.g., department flows: ER for first two, Surgery for third), logical activity sequences (registration  triage/diagnosis  tests/treatment  discharge), and chronological progression within each case. All 18 events are exhaustively and exclusively grouped with zero omissions, overlaps, or misassignments. Event details are reproduced verbatim without alteration. No explanations are strictly required by the task (which demands groupings/case inference), but the presentation is maximally clear, structured, and concise. No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or logical flaws whatsoever.
