The provided SQL query is logically flawless, accurately implements all requirements, and correctly handles edge cases (e.g., incomplete triplets via NULL LEAD values, multiple triplets per case, sequences not at case start/end). It precisely identifies cases with at least one qualifying consecutive sequence where the 'Create Order' to 'Confirm Order' delta exceeds 5 days, then excludes all events from those cases. DuckDB syntax is correct (LEAD partitioning/ordering, timestamp subtraction yielding INTERVAL, `INTERVAL '5' DAY` comparison). No grouping/ordering issues (none required beyond window PARTITION/ORDER BY). The minor explanatory claim of "assigns a row number" is inaccurate (absent in code) but harmless/non-functional, as LEAD alone suffices for consecutiveness; core solution remains perfect under strict evaluation.
