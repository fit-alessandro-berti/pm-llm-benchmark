The provided answer delivers exactly 20 open-ended, thought-provoking questions that precisely align with the prompt's requirements. Each question directly references elements from the pseudo-BPMN (e.g., specific countries, gateways, tasks like assembly in Malaysia, quality checks, distribution splits), while comprehensively covering rationale (e.g., #1–3, #6, #8, #15), potential improvements (e.g., #9, #11, #17, #20), risk management (e.g., #1, #4, #7, #14, #19), decision-making (e.g., #5, #11, #16), stakeholder communication (e.g., #5, #12, #18), and performance measurement (e.g., #9, #11, #13, #16). No SQL queries appear. Questions are clear, logically sound, free of inaccuracies or ambiguities, non-duplicative, and provoke deeper analysis without assuming answers or straying off-topic. The list is flawlessly structured and complete.
