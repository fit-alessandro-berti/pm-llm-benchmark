**9.8**

### Hypercritical Evaluation
This answer is exceptionally strong—nearly flawless in accuracy, clarity, structure, and depth—but deducts a tiny 0.2 for two minor issues under utmost strictness: (1) it does not explicitly connect the bias to the **LocalResident** distinction (FALSE in Protected Group A vs. TRUE in Unprotected Group B) or note that "LocalBusinessLeadersClub" is inherently inaccessible to non-locals (Protected Group), which subtly strengthens the disparate impact argument and ties directly to the "Protected/Unprotected" labels in the question; (2) the phrase "SkillScore are similar or equal" is a hair imprecise for U003 (75) vs. direct comparators like P002/U002 (78), as "similar" is vague (though logically defensible as "close" in context). These are nitpicks; no factual errors, logical flaws, ambiguities, or omissions of key evidence (e.g., precise case comparisons, adjustment propagation, hiring outcomes). Coverage of manifestation (explicit boosts in B), Group A contrast, bias rationale (non-job-related, disparate impact), and implications (individual/group fairness) is comprehensive and precise. Extras like mitigations enhance without detracting. Structure is logical and concise. Equivalent to academic A+ work.
