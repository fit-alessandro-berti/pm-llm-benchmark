**4.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The dictionary uses correct format (tuples of tuples, seconds-based estimates). Includes a mix of direct (~10 adjacent-ish) and indirect pairs (e.g., ('SS', 'RC'), ('CA', 'WS'), ('PT', 'AS')), adding some complexity as required. Estimates are individually plausible for supply chain (e.g., procurement delays ~1 day, assembly/testing hours). Comments in code and explanation clarify intent. "Representative subset" is explicitly allowed, and 16 pairs show reasonable volume.
- **Major Flaws (heavy deductions)**:
  - **Invalid activity label**: `('OP', 'Q')` uses 'Q', which is **not** among the listed activities (SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS). This is a semantic error making the entry invalid per the scenario. Explanation and comment contradict it ("Quality Inspection"), proving sloppiness. (-2.0 points).
  - **Logical inconsistency in times**: Averages do **not** accumulate logically for transitive pairs in a sequential process. Examples:
    | Pair | Listed Avg (s) | Implied Cumulative (preceding segments) | Issue |
    |------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|-------|
    | ('SS', 'RC') | 86400 | ('SS','OP') 43200 + ('OP','RC') 86400 = 129600 | Too short (~33% under) |
    | ('RC', 'CA') | 14400 | ('RC','QI') 14400 + ('QI','CA') 7200 = 21600 | Too short (~33% under) |
    | ('PT', 'AS') | 21600 | ('PT','PK') 5400 + ('PK','WS') 7200 + ('WS','DT') 86400 + ('DT','AS') 43200  142800 | Way too short (~85% under) |
    This violates the core concept: in linear traces, avg(AC)  avg(AB) + avg(BC). Repeated pattern shows misunderstanding of "temporal distances" for non-adjacent pairs. (-2.5 points).
  - **Incomplete representation**: While subset allowed, misses key long-range pairs (e.g., ('SS', 'AS'), ('RC', 'DT')) for "complexity... separated by multiple steps." Only ~30% of possible ~45 sequential pairs covered, feels arbitrary/not comprehensive. (-0.8 points).
  - **Minor issues**: SDs sometimes implausibly high/low relative to avgs (e.g., ('WS','DT') SD 28800 > avg 86400/3); no justification for estimates beyond vague "practical considerations." Explanation repeats code issues without correction. (-0.5 points).
- **Overall**: Demonstrates partial grasp but undermined by fatal accuracy/logic errors. Far from "nearly flawless" – would fail real temporal profiling. Strict scaling: 10 (flawless)  4.2 after deductions.
