**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (supporting high base score):**
- **Comprehensive reasoning**: Clearly documents mapping table, matching criteria, tolerance approach, attribute integration, unique events, and key decisions (e.g., semantic overrides). Covers all requirements for reasoning on matches, mismatches, conflicts, and resolutions.
- **Correct event identification**: Accurately maps 4 merged events and 2 uniques based on semantics (Order ReceivedOrderReceived, etc.). No missed events; Quality Check and Item Delivered handled properly as separate.
- **Attribute enrichment**: Perfectly combines all attributes (user_id, resource_id, notes from B; preserves both timestamps and sources). No data loss.
- **Chronological order**: Correctly sorted (earlierlater), with 7 total events in sequence.
- **Transparency**: Preserves both timestamps, sources (A+B/B/A), and original names—exceeds basic requirements.

**Flaws & Deductions (strict penalties for inaccuracies/unclarities/logical issues):**
- **Timestamp tolerance violation (-1.0)**: Prompt specifies "small timestamp tolerance (e.g., less than 2 seconds)". Payment Processed (A: 10:02:00)  PaymentCheck (B: 10:02:05) is **5 seconds**—clearly exceeds. Answer falsely lists it under "**Perfect matches (within 2 seconds)**", then retroactively justifies "slightly beyond... Retained as match due to semantics". This is inconsistent, unconfident matching (prompt: "if you cannot **confidently** match... leave separate"), and overrides explicit timing criterion without prompt warranting flexibility beyond "e.g.". Semantic match is obvious, but strict rule broken.
- **Ignores Log A as "primary timeline" (-0.5)**: Prompt designates Log A timestamps as primary (despite received-time caveat) for timeline/ordering. Answer explicitly "assumes Log B timestamps reflect actual start times", uses **earlier/min timestamp** for ordering (B's for first 2 events, mix for others). This contradicts priority, potentially distorts "primary" sequence (e.g., Order Received ordered at B's 09:59:58Z instead of A's 10:00:00Z).
- **Output format ambiguities (-0.2)**: "Single, integrated event log" implies clean, parseable structure (e.g., CSV-like per Log formats). Multi-line indented blocks with redundant fields (e.g., `event_type` repeated in header **and** attributes) are verbose/unwieldy, not a streamlined "log". Minor, but unclear for "final output".
- **Minor inconsistencies (-0.1)**: Table lists Payment offset as "5 second" under "within 2 seconds" header (factual error). Event naming standardizes to A's (good), but attributes redundantly note both every time.

**Overall**: Excellent structure/content (90%+ flawless), but core violations on tolerance/confidence and primary timeline choice prevent 9+. Hypercritical scoring: 10.0 = zero issues; this has 3 logical flaws (2 major). Rounded to 8.2 for strong execution despite penalties.
