**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Assessment)
This grade reflects a solid but flawed response with **major inaccuracies** (one critical omission in normative violations), **structural unclarities** (incomplete case coverage in numbered sections), and **minor logical flaws** (inconsistent handling of desiderata across cases). Per instructions, even minor issues warrant significant deductions; the major miss on Case 2's skipped "Inform Applicant" (a strict normative requirement) alone prevents any score above 7.0, as it undermines Task 1's completeness. The response is ~70% correct but not "nearly flawless."

#### Major Issues (Severe Deductions: -3.0 total)
1. **Critical Inaccuracy in Task 1 (Normative Violations)**: Case 2 has **three clear violations**, but the answer identifies only two:
   - Risk Assessment before Credit Check  (correct).
   - Finalize Documentation after rejection  (correct).
   - **Missed: No "Inform Applicant" after Loan Decision** (at 09:30), which skips a required step ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed"; "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision"; "no skipping activities"). Case 2 jumps to Finalize Documentation  Close Case without it. This is explicitly forbidden ("Skipping activities in the required sequence"). Omitting this makes the analysis incomplete and factually wrong—hypercritical deduction of -2.0.
   
   No explicit statement that Case 1 and Case 3 comply with normative rules (e.g., Case 1 follows sequence perfectly; Case 3 does too despite delays). Sections imply it via omission, but task requires clear identification "which cases."

#### Minor Issues (Significant Deductions: -1.0 total)
1. **Inaccuracy/Logical Flaw in Task 2 (Desiderata)**: Claims Case 1 "follows all... desiderata conditions without any violations." However:
   - No Follow-up Call in Case 1 log (just like Case 3, where absence is explicitly noted as a desideratum failure).
   - Desiderata: "encouraged—but not strictly required—to perform a Follow-up Call... before closing." Log shows none for Case 1, so it fails this (suboptimal). Inconsistent with flagging Case 3 only—logical flaw (-0.5).
   
   Case 2's desiderata not addressed (e.g., Credit Check ~1h after app <24h, but irrelevant due to normative fails; missing Inform can't meet "promptly inform").

2. **Structural Unclarity**: 
   - Sections 1-2 don't cover all cases explicitly (e.g., no "Case 1: Compliant" or "Case 3: Normative OK"). Task expects per-case breakdown.
   - Unrequested "Recommendations" section adds noise, diluting focus (-0.5).

#### Strengths (Why Not Lower)
- Correctly flags Case 2's two violations with accurate explanations.
- Task 2 for Case 3 spot-on (timings calculated correctly: Credit Check ~49h >24h; Inform ~51h >48h; no follow-up). Clarifies "not severe" via context/summary.
- Task 3: Provides plausible justifications (e.g., "miscommunication" for Case 2; "operational inefficiencies" for Case 3) in "Observations."
- Clear, organized writing; good summaries.

Overall: Competent but critically incomplete on core analysis. A 10.0 requires zero misses; 9.0 minor polish only. This earns mid-tier for partial accuracy.
