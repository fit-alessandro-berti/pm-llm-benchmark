The answer is flawless: fully accurate identification of conformant (1, 4) and deviant cases (2, 3, 5); precise, text-referenced explanations for each violation without over- or under-interpretation; logical structure with at-a-glance summary, case-by-case breakdown, and rule synthesis; no ambiguities, redundancies beyond useful emphasis, or flaws in reasoning. All constraints (e.g., mandatory sequencing including Package before Ship, no fulfillment after/outside proper paths, Check before Authorize) are correctly applied, resolving description's minor ambiguities conservatively yet definitively.
