**10.0**

The draft prompt is exceptionally well-crafted, with zero inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical flaws. It precisely sets up the context, defines the task unambiguously (emphasizing case-level filtering before event selection), reinforces via rephrasing, and subtly guides toward correct SQL constructs (GROUP BY, HAVING, subquery/IN or equivalent) without spoiling the solution. The "full set of events" clearly implies `SELECT *`, and all requirements align perfectly with the target query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

(or equivalent CTE/JOIN).

The accompanying thought process breakdown is equally flawless: methodical (goal  key info  brainstorm  draft  refine  review), self-correcting where needed, accurate on SQL nuances (HAVING over WHERE for aggregates), considers alternatives (IN vs. JOIN/CTE), and justifies wording choices for clarity and guidance. No minor issues; this is a model for perfect benchmark prompt engineering.
