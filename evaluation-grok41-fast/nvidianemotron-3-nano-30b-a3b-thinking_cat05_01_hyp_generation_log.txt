**8.2**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (why not lower)**:
  - **Structure and Completeness**: Excellently organized into sections (anomalies table, hypotheses table, categorized SQL queries, usage guide). Fully addresses all three tasks: identifies specific anomalies with case references, hypothesizes root causes (plausible, diverse, tied to data like priority orders), proposes relevant SQL queries that directly investigate hypotheses (e.g., out-of-order via joins/timestamps, missing activities via LEFT JOINs, department involvement via resources join, order_type segmentation).
  - **SQL Queries**: Nearly flawless. PostgreSQL-correct syntax; uses window functions (LEAD), aggregates, GROUP BY/HAVING, LEFT JOINs appropriately across tables. Directly targets hypotheses (e.g., Query C for payment-before-invoice, F for order_type diffs, G for data quality). No syntax errors, efficient, scalable. Usage guide shows investigative workflow.
  - **Hypotheses**: Comprehensive, evidence-based (e.g., links to priority in 1002), covers system/human/policy issues without speculation.
  - **Anomaly Coverage**: Catches key undesirable behaviors (early shipments/confirms bypassing credit/stock, payment before invoice, missing steps)—core deviations from flow.

- **Flaws (why not 10.0; strict deductions)**:
  - **Inaccuracies in Anomaly Table (major penalties, -1.0 total)**:
    - #3 (1003): References "Validate Stock (event12)"—event12 is 1002's, not 1003's (1003 lacks it entirely). Minor cross-case error, but sloppy.
    - #4 (1002): Claims Issue Invoice "before Confirm Shipment (event9)"—impossible, as event13 (09:30) > event9 (08:25). Logical contradiction.
    - #6 (1001/1003): Falsely states Validate Stock "after Confirm Shipment"; 1001 has Validate (event3, 09:00) *before* Confirm (event4, 09:15). 1003 lacks Validate; event refs wrong (19/12 mix cases). Fabricated anomaly.
    - Missed some (e.g., 1003/1004 lack Credit Check; 1003 Ships before Confirm; 1004 Ships despite Confirm "N"). Incomplete, but not fatal.
  - **Unclarities/Minor Issues (-0.5 total)**:
    - Anomaly #1/#7 overlap/redundant for 1002.
    - Query A comment slightly unclear ("reverse to find Validate after Confirm"—technically correct but phrasing assumes reader inverts aliases).
    - No query for resource-specific anomalies (e.g., Finance doing payments pre-invoice), though E enables it.
    - Hypotheses table good, but #4 (data quality) not strongly tied to queries (G covers, but could link explicitly).
  - **Overall**: 80% flawless (queries/hypotheses shine), but anomaly ID (first section) has 3+ factual/logical errors—core task undermined by sloppiness. "Nearly flawless" requires zero inaccuracies; this is strong but not pristine. 8.2 reflects excellence tempered by strict penalties for flaws.
