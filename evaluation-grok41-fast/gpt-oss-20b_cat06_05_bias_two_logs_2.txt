**9.2**

The answer correctly identifies **Group B** as exhibiting bias, accurately attributing it to the exclusive +5 CulturalFit boost for LocalBusinessLeadersClub members (absent in Group A). This manifestation is well-discussed as unequal treatment tied to an association correlated with unprotected status (LocalResident=TRUE), creating disparate impact and indirect discrimination. Implications for fairness/equity are comprehensively covered (merit erosion, legal risks, diversity loss, trust erosion), with practical mitigations (e.g., removal, blind screening, audits). Structure is clear, evidence-based (case comparisons, totals), and bottom-line conclusion is precise and unflawed. Minor deductions for table notation glitches (U1 "+55" typo vs. correct 65/217 total; U3 sum omitting explicit personality addend despite correct 203)—sloppy presentation but not altering logic or conclusions, as bias stems from boost presence alone, not totals. No logical flaws in core analysis; assumes reasonable total-score illustration without claiming it's the sole decision criterion.
