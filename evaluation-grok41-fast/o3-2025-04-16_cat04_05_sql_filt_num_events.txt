**8.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **SQL Query Correctness (Strength, +10 base)**: The query is logically flawless and precisely meets the requirements. It correctly uses a subquery to identify `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then INNER JOINs back to `event_log` using `USING (case_id)` to return all columns (`e.*`) for only those cases. This excludes all events from cases >6 events, preserves order/irrelevance of `timestamp`/`activity`, and is efficient/idiomatic SQL (works in DuckDB). No syntax errors, no missing columns, no over/under-filtering.
  
- **Deductions (Strict/Hypercritical)**:
  - **Top comment inaccuracy (-0.5)**: "-- Return only the events that belong to cases with  6 events" incorrectly states "with 6 events" (implying exactly 6) instead of "with 6 or fewer" (as required). Also has extraneous double space ("  6"). Misrepresents the query's behavior.
  - **Explanation Point 1 logical flaw/inaccuracy (-1.0)**: "keeps only those whose count is 6" is outright wrong—the `HAVING` uses `<= 6`, including <6. This is a clear logical error that could mislead readers into thinking the query filters for *exactly* 6 events, not 6. Contradicts the inline `HAVING` comment ("6 or fewer events"—which is correct) and the task spec.
  - **Minor unclarities (-0.5)**: Explanation Point 1 says "count is 6" without qualifier; overall prose has inconsistency between top comment, inline comment, and explanation. No mention of why JOIN/USING is chosen (e.g., efficiency), but not required—still, hypercritically, lacks completeness.

- **Overall**: SQL is 10/10 flawless, but included explanation/comment has multiple inaccuracies/logical flaws misstating the filter (exactly 6 vs. 6), warranting significant deduction per instructions ("Even minor issues should result in a significantly lower score"). Not "nearly flawless" due to potential for confusion/misinterpretation. A perfect rewrite would fix prose to match SQL exactly.
