The provided answer delivers exactly 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions that precisely align with the prompt's requirements. Each question focuses on insights (e.g., #15 on data silos), potential issues (e.g., #1 on geopolitical disruptions, #17 on cyber-attacks), strategies for improvement (e.g., #4 on circular models, #11 on supplier collaboration), and decision implications (e.g., #3 on JIT trade-offs, #9 on ethics vs. costs). All are directly grounded in the described process (e.g., referencing specific suppliers like Taiwan/South Korea, assembly in Malaysia, JIT strategies, distribution centers, digital systems, etc.). No SQL queries or extraneous content appear in the final list; questions are clear, logically structured, non-repetitive, and free of inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws. The minimal introductory phrase ("Of course. Here are...") serves only as a standard list header and does not detract from the "just list the questions" directive, as the substance is a pure numbered list. This is nearly flawless execution.
