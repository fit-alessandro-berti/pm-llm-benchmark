**9.5**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Correctness (flawless)**: The query precisely achieves the goal. Subquery correctly identifies `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`. INNER `JOIN` (via `USING`) ensures only events from qualifying cases are returned, excluding all events from cases with >6 events. `SELECT e.*` returns the full set of events (all columns). No logical flaws in filtering/grouping.
- **Completeness**: Handles the requirement exactly—no over- or under-filtering. Works in DuckDB (standard SQL; `USING` supported).
- **Clarity/Readability**: Well-aliased (`e`, `c`), concise, with clear explanation matching the logic.
- **Minor deductions (-0.5 total, strict per instructions)**:
  - Unnecessary `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp`: Prompt does **not** require ordering (outputs "the full set of events" without specifying order). This adds an extraneous clause, potentially altering output presentation in ways not requested (e.g., imposes a specific sort not guaranteed otherwise). In strict benchmarking, extra operations (even harmless) are a minor inaccuracy against "craft a ... query that ... returns only the events".
  - Explanation calls it a "DuckDB SQL query" but provides generic SQL (fine, as it works in DuckDB, but hypercritically, no DuckDB-specific optimization like `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` is used despite context).
- **Why not 10.0?** Not "nearly flawless"—minor extras violate "only" the specified result. Equivalent flawless version: Remove `ORDER BY`. Still exceptional overall.
