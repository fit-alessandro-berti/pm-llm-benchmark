**7.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: 
  - Correct overall structure: All required keys present with proper types (sets of tuples for relational constraints, dict of sets for `activ_freq`).
  - Logical chain captured well in `always_before` and `always_after`: Full precedence RO < CA < RI < PI < QC < PO < GSL < D < IC [< RP], correctly using definition ("if first, second previously" for before; after for subsequent). Handles RP optionality perfectly (precedence if occurs, no `always_after` from IC).
  - `activ_freq` accurate and complete: Covers all 10 activities; {1} for mandatory linear steps, {0,1} for optional RP with plausible rationale.
  - `never_together` empty reasonable for linear flow.
  - `equivalence` plausible (same counts for RO/IC and PI/QC given linear/singleton occurrences); `directly_follows` mostly captures assumed rigid sequence.
  - Explanation mostly clear, ties to scenario.

- **Inaccuracies/Incompletenesses (deductions)**:
  - **Wrong comment in `always_before` for `('CA', 'RO')`**: States "Check Availability must occur before Receive Order is complete" — directly contradicts the constraint's semantics (enforces RO *before* CA). Misleads readers on meaning. Major clarity/accuracy flaw (-1.5).
  - **Incomplete `directly_follows`**: Claims "rigid pipeline: RO  CA  RI  ...  IC  RP" and "activities must occur consecutively", but misses `('RO', 'CA')` despite sequence starting there. No `('IC', 'RP')` (understandable for optionality, but inconsistency with "RP" in pipeline). Logical flaw in representing claimed rigidity (-1.0).
  - **Unidirectionality in comments/explanation for equivalence**: E.g., "If order is received, invoice must be generated same number..." ignores bidirectional nature ("same occurrences" if *either* occurs). Minor but adds unclarity (-0.5).
  - **Minor unclarities**: `never_together` comment says "conflicts are minimal" (implies some exist, but empty); pipeline includes RP unconditionally despite {0,1}. No modeling of potential stock unavailability (e.g., CA=1 assumes always proceeds), but scenario assumes full flow (-0.5 cumulative minors).
  - **No major criminal/logic violations**, but not "nearly flawless" — multiple issues prevent 9+.

Strict threshold: Flawless = 10; any inaccuracy/unclarity drops significantly (here ~3 points total deduction from ideal).
