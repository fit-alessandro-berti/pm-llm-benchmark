**7.0**

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies (8/10):** Core contradictions (responded_existence forcing E after A vs. noncoexistence forbidding E+C; incompatibility with full flow requiring E then C) are accurately identified. However, the first bullet weakly claims a "contradiction between precedence and existence" (these are compatible/redundant) and vaguely ties it to noncoexistence without precise explanation of *how* (e.g., no explicit note that existence(C) + noncoexistence(E,C) forbids all E, thus forbids A via responded_existence). Minor unclarity deducts heavily.
- **Hypotheses (10/10):** Comprehensive, directly matches prompt examples (misinterpretation, incremental changes, data issues), adds logical extras (simplifications, technical error). Flawless.
- **SQL Queries (5/10):** Covers key checks (a/b/c solid for no-E-with-C, E+C coexistence, A without E; leverages timestamps in d/e partially). However:
  - **Major flaw in d:** Logically incorrect for precedence violation due to multi-event cartesian joins + ambiguous WHERE OR without parens, flags irrelevant cases (e.g., late R after C flags valid traces). Fails to properly check "exists C with no prior R" (needs per-event subquery/EXISTS with timestamp filter).
  - No temporal precision for responded_existence (e.g., no query confirms E *after* specific A timestamps; c only catches no E at all, missing E-before-A cases fully).
  - Query e mismatched: Label claims to verify "every E after A" (unrelated to model), checks inverted pairs (useful but not tied to constraint).
  - **Critical omission:** Zero use of `adjusters` table despite explicit prompt requirement ("on the `claims`, `adjusters`, and `claim_events` tables") and example ("evaluation steps always correspond with assigned adjusters," e.g., JOIN `claim_events.resource` to `adjusters` for specialization/region match on A/E). No query links assignment resource to E performer or specialization—direct violation.
  - Minor: No checks for init(R) or existence(C) absences; duplicates possible without DISTINCT/GROUP BY.
- **Overall Structure/Fidelity (9/10):** Matches prompt sections independently, no hints leaked, concise. Minor deduct for ending summary sentence (slightly interpretive).
- **Total:** Strong conceptually but undermined by SQL inaccuracies/omissions (especially adjusters, flawed d)—not "nearly flawless." Strict penalty yields 7.0.
