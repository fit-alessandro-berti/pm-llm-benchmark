The final answer provides a completely accurate, exhaustive, and logically sound grouping of all 18 events into three cases, perfectly matching the unique patient_age/gender identifiers and their chronological/logical flows (registration  triage/tests  consultation  procedure/treatment  discharge). No events are missing, duplicated, or misassigned. The table is precise, the key logic (unique identifiers, temporal order, department consistency, journey closure) is explicitly and correctly stated without flaws, and cross-verification confirms no contradictions (e.g., Case 2 correctly includes interleaved lab events 8/10; Case 1's Radiology detour fits; Case 3's Surgery path is isolated). Minor presentational typos (e.g., missing parentheses, spacing in journeys, "year-old") are cosmetic and do not impact clarity, accuracy, or conclusions.
