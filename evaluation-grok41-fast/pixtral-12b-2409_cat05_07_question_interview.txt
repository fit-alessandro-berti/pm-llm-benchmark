**8.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**: 
  - All questions are open-ended, targeted, and directly address key prompt goals (missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, exceptions). Excellent coverage of the process stages (e.g., documentation, assignment, inspection, screening, audits, communication).
  - Logical organization with categories enhances clarity without adding fluff.
  - No SQL or overtly technical implementation (e.g., no code, schemas, or builds).
  - Faithful to description: Questions map precisely to described elements (e.g., Q3 on assignment factors quotes description verbatim; Q10 on exceptions like insurance/clauses).
  - Comprehensive (12 questions) without redundancy; uncovers nuances like workloads, negotiations, repairs.

- **Flaws/Deductions (strict penalties for any issues)**:
  - **Minor overreach on implementation details (Q2, Q11)**: "Database structured, and what specific fields" borders on system design (prompt explicitly bans "implementation details"; fields are conceptual but structure implies schema-level). "Tools and systems" in Q11 risks technical specs (description mentions "email threads, internal CRMs, project management tools" conceptually—question probes too deeply). *(-0.4 total)*.
  - **Scope creep (Q12)**: Entire "Continuous Improvement" section introduces post-onboarding elements (feedback, KPIs) absent from description, which ends at audits/move-in. Prompt is strictly "their process" as described—not meta-improvements. *(-0.6)*.
  - **Compound phrasing (minor unclarities)**: Several questions mash two ideas (e.g., Q2, Q6, Q7), potentially diluting focus/response quality. *(-0.3)*.
  - **Superficial extras**: Unasked intro ("Certainly!") and closing summary—harmless but unnecessary bloat. *(-0.2)*.
  - **Missed depth opportunities**: No questions on multi-unit specifics (e.g., sequencing for "number of units"), regional office variations, or contractor hiring in inspections (described but unprobed). Not fatal, but incomplete coverage. *(-0.3)*.

- **Overall**: Near-flawless execution (90%+ alignment), but strict policy demands deductions for edge violations and extras—prevents 9+. Logical flow impeccable; no inaccuracies.
