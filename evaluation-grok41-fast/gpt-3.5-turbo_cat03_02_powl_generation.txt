**3.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Fatal Implementation Errors (Code Won't Run, -4.0 penalty)**: Nearly all `root.order.add_edge` calls reference inner nodes (e.g., `CS`, `DA`, `ACI`, `BNC`, `D_R`, `CD`, `MD`, `QA`, `SA`) that are **not** direct members of `root.nodes`. `StrictPartialOrder.order` only allows edges between its own `nodes`. This triggers attribute/key errors or invalid graph operations at runtime. Only `SR -> contract_setup` works. The code is non-functional.
  
- **Missing Critical Dependencies (-1.5 penalty)**: No edges enforce `contract_setup -> da_aci`, `da_aci -> bnc_d_r`, `bnc_d_r -> deploy_choice`, `deploy_choice -> qa_sa`, or `qa_sa -> GLA`. These are essential for sequencing (e.g., both DA/ACI before loop; loop before choice; choice before QA||SA; QA||SA completion before GLA). Model executes everything concurrently where strict order/parallel completion is required.

- **Semantically Incorrect Loop Exit Modeling (-0.8 penalty)**: `BNC -> deploy_choice` and `D_R -> deploy_choice` violate loop semantics. `* (BNC, D_R)` exits **only after BNC** (skipping D_R); after D_R, it loops back to BNC. Edge from `D_R` allows invalid early exit to `deploy_choice` without final BNC. Correct: edge from `bnc_d_r` (whole loop node) to `deploy_choice`.

- **Unnecessary/Redundant Wrapper (-0.4 penalty)**: `contract_setup = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[CS])` is pointless (equivalent to `CS` alone). Adds nesting complexity without benefit; `CS` should be a direct `root.nodes` entry. Inflates `root.nodes` uselessly.

- **Incomplete Choice Modeling (-0.2 penalty)**: `deploy_choice` lacks a silent transition, but scenario specifies "exclusive choice... only one... chosen" (XOR implies one path; example uses `skip` for optional exit, but here no optional—pure XOR fine, minor). Unused `skip` dangles.

- **Minor Clarity/Style Issues (-0.1 penalty)**: Variable `D_R` uses underscore (ok but inconsistent with others); labels match scenario but `SR` omits "verifying" (minor). No `root.order = {}` explicit (defaults empty, ok).

**Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies/constructs sub-models: activities, `da_aci`/`qa_sa` parallels (empty order), loop/XOR operators/children. `root.nodes` list conceptually close (if fixed). Attempts correct *concepts* for some edges (e.g., DA/ACI both -> loop; QA/SA both -> GLA). Imports flawless.

**Overall**: Broken code, incomplete/incorrect graph, semantic flaws in loop. "Nearly flawless" impossible; scores ~10 only for runnable, exact-semantic match like the ideal structure (direct nodes + compound-to-compound edges). Strict deduction yields 3.0.
