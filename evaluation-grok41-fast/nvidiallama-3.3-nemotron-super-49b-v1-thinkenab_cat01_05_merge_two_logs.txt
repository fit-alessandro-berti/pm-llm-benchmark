**9.5**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Summary
The answer is exceptionally strong overall—comprehensive, logically sound, and directly addresses all requirements with clear structure (table for log, detailed reasoning, chronological summary). It correctly applies the 2-second tolerance strictly (merging 1-2s diffs, rejecting 5s), uses Log A timestamps as primary for merged events (justified), includes **all** attributes without loss or invention, indicates origins via table design ("-" for missing fields), and orders chronologically without errors. Matches are semantically reasonable (e.g., "Item Shipped"/"Shipping"). Reasoning explicitly covers strategy, each decision, attributes, and challenges.

**Minor Deductions (hypercritical only):**
- **Exact tolerance edge case**: 2s diffs (Order Received: exactly 2s; Item Shipped: exactly 2s) are treated as matches despite "less than 2 seconds" phrasing ("e.g." allows flexibility, but strict reading might prefer <2s only; no penalty for consistency, but noted).
- **Table polish**: Notes fields omit original quotes (e.g., "Event captured at warehouse system" vs. original with quotes); minor truncation/spacing (e.g., Quality Check note has trailing space). Not inaccurate, but unclarities in verbatim reproduction.
- **No dual timestamps**: Problem allows "include both" for diffs; answer selects one (fine, but could enrich further without conflicts).
- **Reasoning nit**: "Names Implied distinct steps" has typo ("Implied" should be "imply"); assumes "validation vs. final processing" without strong evidence (semantic stretch, but logical).

No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or omissions—only cosmetic/pedantic issues prevent 10.0. Would be production-ready.
