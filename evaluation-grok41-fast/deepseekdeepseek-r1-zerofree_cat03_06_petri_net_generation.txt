**8.0**

### Reasoning for the grade (hypercritical evaluation of the final boxed code only):
The code correctly constructs a syntactically valid accepting Petri net using the required pm4py modules, defines all relevant places and transitions, adds them properly, connects arcs for the main sequence (CR  DV  FC  CA  AP  P  N  CL), and sets `im[source] = 1` and `fm[sink] = 1`. Labels use full activity names matching the scenario (e.g., "Document Verification", "In-depth Investigation"). Loops are modeled via nondeterministic choices:
- DV-RDS loop: `p_after_DV  t_RDS  p_after_CR  t_DV`, allowing multiple iterations before proceeding to FC.
- FC-II loop: `p_after_FC  t_II  p_after_DV  t_FC`, allowing multiple iterations before proceeding to CA.

**Strengths (supporting high score)**:
- Matches the required "logical sequence with possible loops (e.g., between DV and RDS, between FC and II)".
- Token flow reaches `fm` from `im` via finite loops or straight path.
- No syntax errors; follows example style (e.g., `petri_utils.add_arc_from_to`).
- Initial token represents "new claim arriving" before CR; final after CL.

**Flaws (deductions for strictness, each minor-to-moderate inaccuracy lowering score significantly)**:
1. **AP is mandatory (-1.5)**: Scenario explicitly states AP occurs *only* "if the amount surpasses a certain threshold" (conditional/optional). Code forces linear path (`p_after_CA  t_AP  p_after_AP  t_P`), no bypass/silent transition or split-merge structure. Even the code's comment admits "assuming AP is part of the main flow for now" – unflawed model would add e.g. silent `t_skip_AP` (label=None) from `p_after_CA` merging to a common pre-P place.
2. **II loop enables illogical path (-0.5)**: `t_II  p_after_DV`, but `p_after_DV` outgoing to *both* `t_FC` (correct re-FC) *and* `t_RDS` (illogical: re-document submission after fraud investigation, when docs already verified). Proper model needs separate `p_before_FC` (after docs branch, before FC) for II back-target, preventing wrong branch.
3. **RDS loop semantic naming/position minor mismatch (-0.0, not deducted as functional)**: Back to `p_after_CR` (semantically post-registration) works functionally (`p_after_CR  t_DV`) but implies re-registration possible (minor; structure ok).
4. **No modeling for C (-0.0)**: Scenario starts "customer files **Insurance Claim (C)**", but code begins source  CR (acceptable per "new claim arriving"; C external trigger).

Overall: ~85% flawless (excellent structure/loops/syntax), but conditional AP unmodeled and loop flaw allow invalid behaviors  not "nearly flawless". 10.0 requires perfect logic (optional AP, clean loops no spurious paths). 8.0 reflects strong but critically imperfect solution.
