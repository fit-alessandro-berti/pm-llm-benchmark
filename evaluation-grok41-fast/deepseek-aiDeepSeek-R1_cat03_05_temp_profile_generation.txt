**8.0**

### Explanation of Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (why not lower)**:
  - Perfect structure: Valid Python dictionary with correct key-value format (tuples of tuples), seconds-based times matching example (e.g., 86400=1d).
  - Representative subset: 9 consecutive + 7 non-consecutive pairs, ensuring "complexity" with multi-step examples (e.g., ('SS','AS'), ('RC','PT')) across procurement, manufacturing, logistics.
  - Domain-realistic estimates: Plausible supply chain timings (short internal: 21600s packaging; long external: 604800s lead times/after-sales); stdevs scale logically with risk (high for suppliers, low for packaging).
  - Cumulative logic mostly sound: E.g., ('SS','RC')=691200s exactly sums ('SS','OP')+'OP','RC'); ('OP','QI'), ('SS','QI'), ('RC','PT'), ('QI','WS') all precisely match consecutive sums.
  - Extra value: Comments and rationale clarify estimates without violating task.

- **Flaws (strict deductions, preventing 9+)**:
  - **Inaccuracy in ('CA','DT')**: Listed as (388800,172800) "~4.5 days". But sums consecutive chain CAPTPKWSDT =86400+21600+10800+172800=**291600s (~3.37 days)**. 388800 is ~33% inflated (no justification; possible arithmetic error). Internal inconsistency undermines "estimated" credibility for multi-step pairs.
  - **Minor discrepancy in ('SS','AS')**: 1900800s (~22d) vs full chain sum **1933200s** (~22.37d). ~1.7% off (rounding?), but unnecessary given precision elsewhere.
  - **Stdev approximations imprecise**: Non-consecutive stdevs often copy consecutive (e.g., ('SS','RC') stdev=172800 matches dominant 'OP-RC', fine) but ignore variance propagation (e.g., ('QI','WS') stdev=86400 too low vs. chain (86400²+43200²+3600²+3600²)96700s; listed 86400 understates). Not "flawless."
  - **Logical unclarities**: Assumes strict linear order despite "complex" scenario/traces (no loops/skips modeled, e.g., potential rework QIOP). Rationale claims "macro-level segments" but doesn't address timestamp semantics (end-to-start?).
  - No exhaustiveness penalty (subset OK), but flaws in ~12.5% of entries (2/16) + approximations = not "nearly flawless."

Nearly excellent (comprehensive, useful), but strict policy demands deduction for demonstrable errors/inconsistencies. 10.0 requires zero issues.
