The provided answer is nearly flawless. Both primary and alternative queries are semantically correct, efficient for DuckDB, preserve all original columns without extras (via `e.*` or `* EXCLUDE`), correctly use `GROUP BY`/`HAVING` or window functions to identify and filter cases with 6 events total, and return the full events for qualifying cases. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities; explanations are precise and reinforce validity. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., implicit `INNER JOIN`) are standard and unproblematic in DuckDB.
