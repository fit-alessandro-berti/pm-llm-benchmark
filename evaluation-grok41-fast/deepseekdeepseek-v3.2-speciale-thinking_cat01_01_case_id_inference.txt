The provided answer correctly identifies and groups all 18 events into exactly three coherent cases based on consistent patient attributes (age/gender), department alignments, activity sequences, and chronological order within each case. All events are accounted for without overlap or omission (5+7+6=18). Each case's flow is logically plausible and accurately summarized:

- Case 1: Events 1471215 form a complete ER trauma pathway (registration  triage  imaging  diagnosis  discharge) for the unique 45M patient.
- Case 2: Events 25810111417 form a complete ER infection pathway (registration  triage  lab request/completion  diagnosis  prescription  discharge) for the unique 62F patient.
- Case 3: Events 369131618 form a complete elective surgery pathway (registration  pre-op consult  preparation  procedure  recovery  discharge) for the unique 28M patient.

No cross-case inconsistencies (e.g., Dr. Lee's involvement spans cases appropriately; no attribute mismatches). Presentation is precise, structured, and unambiguous.
