7.2

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (supporting higher base score):**
- **Anomalies identification (9/10):** Excellently captures core contradictions (e.g., noncoexistence of E/C vs. intended flow and existence of C; missing P/N dependencies). Point 3 correctly notes absence of P enforcement. Point 4 slightly overreaches (model anomalies are constraint-based, not schema-level adjuster validation), but ties back logically.
- **Hypotheses (10/10):** Flawless—directly mirrors prompt examples (misinterpretation, incremental changes, data issues, business pressure) with additional insightful ones (e.g., lack of cross-validation). Clear, plausible, independent presentation.
- **Structure and independence (10/10):** Clean sections, no hints leaked, self-contained.

**Fatal Flaws (drastically lowering score—strict deduction for inaccuracies/logical errors):**
- **SQL queries riddled with inaccuracies/unclarities (4/10 overall):**
  1. **Query 1:** Mostly correct, but `WHERE ce_eval.activity IS NULL AND ce_close.timestamp IS NOT NULL` is redundant (JOIN ensures close exists); minor but sloppy.
  2. **Query 2:** Major logical flaw. Noncoexistence violation is *any* trace with **both** E and C (order irrelevant in standard DECLARE noncoexistence). Query only catches MIN(close) < MIN(eval) (close before eval), **missing eval-before-close cases** (common in valid flows). Purpose claims "coexistence" but implements partial order check—misrepresents model violation. Should be: `SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity IN ('E', 'C') GROUP BY claim_id HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) = 2;`.
  3. **Query 3:** Assumes single A/E per trace (uses direct timestamps, ignores multiples). Finds E before A (good for "response(E,A)" interpretation), but if model is responded_existence(A,E) ("if A then E"), violation is A without subsequent E—not captured. Ambiguous model notation unaddressed; hypercritical: incomplete verification.
  4. **Query 4:** Solid.
  5. **Query 5:** Gross hallucination. **Invented region mappings** ('North' for home, 'South' for auto) **not in schema** (region is generic VARCHAR; no examples given). JOIN `resource = name` plausible but unverified (resource could be ID/system). Specialization match ok, but region poisons it. Irrelevant to model (extra-schema), undermining "verification of anomalies."
- **Minor but penalized issues:** Anomalies #2 misstates responded_existence as "E only if prior A" (strictly, standard DECLARE responded_existence(A,E) is "if A then E after"—allows lone E; answer implies converse). Query purposes occasionally conflate model rules vs. intended flow vs. schema.
- **Overall:** 80%+ excellence, but SQL flaws are "significant inaccuracies" per rubric (core task=verification via SQL). Not "nearly flawless"—deducted 2.8 points total. 7.2 reflects strict balance.
