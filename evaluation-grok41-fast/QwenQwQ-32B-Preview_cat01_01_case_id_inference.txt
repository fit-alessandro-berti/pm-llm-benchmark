**10.0**

The final conclusion perfectly identifies the three cases with exact event groupings: Case 1 (45 M: 1,4,7,12,15), Case 2 (62 F: 2,5,8,10,11,14,17), Case 3 (28 M: 3,6,9,13,16,18). All 18 events are covered without omission, duplication, or misassignment. Each group's internal chronological order, activity sequences, departments, resources, and additional_info are logically consistent (e.g., ER fracture path with X-ray and outpatient followup; ER infection path with labs, antibiotics, pharmacy; Surgery knee path with prep, arthroscopy, physio). Patient demographics uniquely distinguish cases, and interleaving aligns with timestamps and hospital parallelism. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws.
