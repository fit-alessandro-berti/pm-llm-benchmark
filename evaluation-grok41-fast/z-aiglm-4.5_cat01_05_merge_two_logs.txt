**9.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong in structure, completeness, transparency, and adherence to most requirements—detailed reasoning, chronological sorting with clear primary timestamp logic (Log A prioritized), attribute enrichment, origin indication via `source`, semantic mapping, and comprehensive documentation. The table format effectively presents a "single integrated log" while distinguishing sources/nulls. However, under utmost strictness, minor-to-moderate flaws warrant deductions (total -0.8 from 10.0):

- **Moderate Logical Flaw in Tolerance Application (-0.5)**: Prompt specifies "less than 2 seconds" (*strictly <2s*). Answer uses "**2 seconds (inclusive)**" and merges exactly 2s diffs (Order Received: exactly 2s; Item Shipped: exactly 2s abs diff). This is an inaccuracy/deviation from prompt wording, even if practically reasonable ("e.g." is illustrative, but criteria is explicit). Payment (5s) correctly not merged. Hypercritical: Core matching logic flawed.
  
- **Minor Data Inaccuracy (-0.2)**: Notes for merged Order Received truncated to "Event captured at warehouse" (omits "system" from original Log B). All other attributes exact. Unacceptable for data integration task.

- **Minor Unclarity/Over-Engineering (-0.1)**: Sorting logic ("timestamp_A for merged/A, timestamp_B for B-only") works perfectly but relies on implicit reader parsing of nulls/duals for chronology; prompt expects "based on a chosen primary timestamp" (implying singular per event). Table dual-timestamps excellent for audit but slightly verbose vs. streamlined unified timestamp per row.

No other issues: Perfect chrono order, semantic mappings defensible/logical (e.g., Payment separate justified by time+notes), full attribute inclusion, unmatched handling ideal (e.g., Quality Check slotted correctly), Log A primacy respected, no invention of data. Nearly flawless; high score reflects excellence minus strict penalties.
