**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Base Score)**:
  - **Normative violations (Task 1)**: Flawless. Correctly identifies Case 1/3 as compliant; Case 2's three violations (out-of-order Risk Assessment before Credit Check, missing mandatory Inform Applicant post-Decision, prohibited Finalize Documentation post-Rejection) precisely match rules/sequence. No misses, e.g., correctly notes Inform is required regardless of approve/reject.
  - **Structure & Clarity**: Exemplary use of tables for all tasks; concise explanations; summary table and recommendations add value without straying. Covers all cases explicitly.
  - **Interpretations/Justifications (Task 3)**: Excellent—reasonable, constraint-aligned suggestions (e.g., data-entry error for order swap, automated workflow bug for invalid Finalize, external notification for missing Inform, workload for delays). Covers violations/deviations without excusing them.
  - **Desiderata Clarification**: Consistently notes "soft"/suboptimal nature where listed (e.g., "non-critical omission", "may affect customer satisfaction").

- **Flaws Penalized (Strict Deductions, Total -1.8)**:
  - **Inaccuracy/Unclear Logic in Desiderata (Task 2, Major Issue -1.2)**: Case 1 incorrectly listed as "None" despite universally missing Follow-up Call (explicit desideratum: "encouraged... sometime before closing"; all logs lack it, Case 3 log notes it). Inconsistency—lists as "Desideratum not met" for Cases 2/3 but denies for Case 1 ("absence does not constitute a violation"), contradicting task to "identify which cases fail to meet" and clarify as "suboptimal." Summary reinforces error: Case 1 " All recommendations met." Timings fine, but Follow-up failure must be noted uniformly for completeness/accuracy.
  - **Minor Overinterpretation (-0.3)**: Case 2 desiderata lists "Timing of 'Inform Applicant' cannot be judged"—accurate but incomplete; missing activity inherently fails "promptly inform" desideratum (>0h delay = infinite), though soft and secondary to normative violation.
  - **Minor Redundancy/Verbosity (-0.3)**: Table explanations occasionally repetitive (e.g., Case 2 normative repeats timestamps unnecessarily).

Nearly flawless (normative perfect, structure elite), but desiderata inconsistency is a clear logical/accuracy flaw warranting significant penalty per instructions. No other issues (e.g., no normative misses, interpretations on-point).
