**7.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Strengths (supporting higher score):**
  - Correctly preserves all original constraints without removal or alteration of existing entries.
  - Valid Python dictionary format throughout, with precise support/confidence values.
  - Introduces relevant new activities (e.g., `CheckSensitiveAttributes`, `BiasMitigationCheck`, `ManualReview`) aligned with prompt examples.
  - Adds targeted bias-mitigation constraints: e.g., `nonsuccession`/`nonchainsuccession` from `CheckSensitiveAttributes` to `FinalDecision` prevents direct biased decisions (-good logic); `coexistence`/`responded_existence`/`response`/`precedence` chains mandate checks/reviews after sensitive checks (-directly addresses prompt's "cannot immediately follow without check", "coexist with ManualReview"); `existence` for mitigation steps enforces fairness globally.
  - Explanation covers how constraints reduce bias (prevents direct decisions, mandates checkpoints) and groups rationales reasonably close to "brief rationale for each."
  - Overall, meaningfully limits bias by blocking sensitive-to-decision paths and requiring interventions.

- **Inaccuracies/Unclarities/Logical Flaws (deducting to 7.2):**
  - **Unnecessary/non-bias additions (major flaw, -1.0):** Adds `exactly_one` for original `StartApplication`/`FinalDecision` (-not bias-related; original empty; disrupts "add new...that limit bias"; redundant with `init`/`existence`/`coexistence`).
  - **Over-proliferation/redundancy (medium flaw, -0.5):** Excessive constraints (e.g., `response` + `precedence` + `succession` + `chainprecedence` for similar pairs like `BiasMitigationCheck``FinalDecision`; `altresponse` + others for `CheckSensitiveAttributes``BiasMitigationCheck`). Prompt expects targeted additions, not model overhaul (-bloats, risks logical conflicts like over-constraining traces).
  - **Logical misuse of templates (medium flaw, -0.5):** `altresponse(CheckSensitiveAttributes, BiasMitigationCheck)` rationale ("alternating pattern of checks") is vague/incorrect (-standard DECLARE alt-response(A,B): A followed by B *xor* another C, or at most one direct B; doesn't clearly "alternate" or mitigate bias; unclear benefit).
  - **Imperfect bias specificity (minor flaw, -0.3):** No constraints for prompt-mentioned `Approve`/`Reject`/`RequestAdditionalInfo` with sensitive (e.g., no `non-succession(CheckApplicantRace, Reject)` or `coexistence(Reject_Minority, ManualReview)`); generic `FinalDecision` works but misses "biased outcome" examples. `existence` mandates bias steps *always* (-too strong; prompt implies conditional on sensitive demographics).
  - **Explanation issues (minor flaw, -0.3):** Grouped not "for each added constraint" (-e.g., lumps 4+ into "Decision Protection"); overly verbose vs. "short explanation"; minor irrelevance ("proper process structure" for `exactly_one`).
  - **Minor nits (-0.2):** Arbitrary addition like `responded_existence(RequestAdditionalInfo  BiasMitigationCheck)` (-RequestAdditionalInfo not inherently sensitive); intro text ("I'll help...") extraneous to **Output** spec.

Nearly good (8+ requires zero such issues), but cumulative flaws (unneeded changes, redundancy, vagueness) prevent higher under "hypercritical" strictness.
