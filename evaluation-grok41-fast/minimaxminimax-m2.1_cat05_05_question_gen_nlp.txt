**10.0**

The final output delivers precisely 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions that directly align with the prompt's requirements: they probe insights (e.g., Q14 on ML predictions), potential issues (e.g., Q1 on geographic vulnerabilities), strategies for improvement (e.g., Q3 on real-time data leveraging), and decision implications (e.g., Q2 on safety stocks vs. JIT). All questions are derived faithfully from the process description (e.g., referencing specific suppliers, regions, transport modes, digital systems, compliance, etc.), phrased in exploratory "How...", "What...", and "What strategies..." formats to encourage deep analysis. No SQL queries or extraneous content beyond clear, logical listing with minimal organizational headings that enhance readability without violating "just list the questions." No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws; coverage is comprehensive, varied, and non-repetitive across key process stages.
