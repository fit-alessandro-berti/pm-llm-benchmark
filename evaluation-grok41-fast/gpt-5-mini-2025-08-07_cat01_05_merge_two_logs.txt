**9.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
This answer is exceptionally strong—comprehensive, logically sound, well-structured, and faithful to the core task—but deducts minor points for two non-flawless elements under utmost strictness: (1) arbitrary expansion of tolerance from the prompt's explicit "<2 seconds" example to <=5s (justified but not identically adhered to, enabling a borderline merge), and (2) the Payment merge, where semantic alignment ("Processed" vs "Check") is defensible via context/notes but not "confidently obvious" like other pairs (e.g., "Order Received/OrderReceived"), risking over-merging per "if you cannot confidently match... leave separate." No misses, duplicates, chronology errors, attribute losses, or major inaccuracies; reasoning is explicit/per-event/summary; format enriched/consistent/readable; all 10 events accounted for (5A + 5B  6 merged/unique); policy choices documented with alternatives offered. Minor unclarities (e.g., exact "2s" calc assumes UTC seconds, unstated but implicit) and extra offers (CSV/JSON) are neutral/positive. Nearly flawless for a high score, but strictness prevents 10.0.
