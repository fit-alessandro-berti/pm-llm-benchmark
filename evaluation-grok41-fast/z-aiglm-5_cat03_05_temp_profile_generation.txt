**7.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Dictionary Only):
- **Strengths (Supporting Higher Score)**:
  - Perfect Python syntax and format: Valid dict with tuple keys `(activity1, activity2)` and tuple values `(avg_seconds, stdev_seconds)`, matching example precisely (e.g., large integers without readability commas are Python-valid).
  - Appropriate pairs: 9 direct sequential pairs covering the full chain (SSOP...AS), plus 8 multi-step "eventually follows" pairs (e.g., SSRC skips 1, SSDT skips many), fulfilling "representative subset" with "complexity by considering pairs separated by multiple steps." All pairs logically precede in the implied linear order.
  - Realistic domain estimates overall: Times scale logically (seconds-based; short internals like hours for CAPT, long for OPRC lead times, post-DT for AS). Stdevs increase with interval length/variability (e.g., high for shipping DTAS, low for assembly PKWS), plausible for high-tech supply chain.
  - Good coverage and balance: 17 pairs provide complexity without exhaustiveness (full linear trace would have ~45 pairs).

- **Weaknesses (Strict Penalties for Inaccuracies/Logical Flaws)**:
  - **Internal inconsistencies in average times (major logical flaws)**: Eventual avgs do not reliably approximate sums of component direct avgs, undermining the "temporal distances" model:
    | Eventual Pair | Provided Avg (secs) | Expected Sum of Directs (secs) | % Error |
    |---------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|---------|
    | ('CA', 'DT') | 518,400 (~6 days)  | 10800+7200+21600+259200=298,800 (~3.5 days) | +73%   |
    | ('SS', 'DT') | 3,024,000 (~35 days)| Sum SSDT directs=1,897,200 (~22 days)     | +59%   |
    | ('OP', 'PT') | 1,490,400 (~17.3d) | 1,296,000+43,200+86,400+10,800=1,436,400   | +4%    |
    | Others       | Close (±10%)       | -                                  | Minor  |
    These are not minor estimation variances; large discrepancies (e.g., double for CADT) indicate flawed computation, contradicting the additive nature of sequential "temporal distances" in linear traces. SSDT labeled "end-to-end" but mismatches own directs by 13 days.
  - **Stdev estimation imprecise**: Roughly plausible but not rigorously derived (e.g., should approximate ( variances) for independents; SSRC close at 450k vs ~433k expected, but others arbitrary/inconsistent with avgs).
  - **Minor unclarities**: Comments provide helpful approximations (e.g., "~15 days") matching numbers, but exacerbate flaws (e.g., SSDT "~35 days" ignores own chain sum). No validation of ZETA deviation logic (not required, but profile should support it implicitly).
  - No exhaustiveness penalty (subset OK), no wrong activities/pairs, no non-sequential invalid pairs.

- **Overall**: Excellent structure/content (9/10), but 2 major avg inconsistencies + imprecise stdevs = not "nearly flawless." Strict deduction: 3 points off max for logical flaws/inaccuracies. 10.0 requires perfect additivity/consistency; 7.0 reflects strong but critically flawed execution.
