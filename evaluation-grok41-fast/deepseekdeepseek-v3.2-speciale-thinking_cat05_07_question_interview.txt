The final list of 16 questions is exceptionally well-constructed, directly fulfilling the prompt by producing a targeted, open-ended series that systematically uncovers missing details (e.g., management agreement in Q2, initial pricing in Q3), decision criteria (Q4, Q9), roles/responsibilities (Q14, with specifics throughout), timing/sequencing (Q6, Q15), and exceptions (Q7, Q12). It follows the process flow logically, probes genuine gaps in the description (e.g., rejection criteria in Q16, repair cost decisions in Q7), and stays strictly conceptual without any SQL, technical implementation, or overly narrow queries. Questions are professional, comprehensive yet concise, and encourage detailed responses.

Hypercritical deductions (-0.2 total): 
- Three questions (Q2, Q14, Q15) start with yes/no phrasing ("Is there...", "Are there..."), which could theoretically elicit brief affirmatives before elaboration, slightly deviating from purely open-ended ideals despite strong follow-ups.
- Q3 and Q13 reference "tools" generically (echoing the original description's CRM/project tools), risking a borderline probe into systems, though remaining process-focused and non-implementation-oriented.

No other inaccuracies, unclarities, repetitions, or flaws; coverage is thorough and flawless in substance.
