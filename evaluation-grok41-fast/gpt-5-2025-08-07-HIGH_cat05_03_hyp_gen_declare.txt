The response is exemplary: precisely identifies the core contradiction (existence(C) + noncoexistence(E,C) rendering E impossible in completed traces, undermining the intended flow), additional anomalies (unreachable responded_existence, allowance of undesired RC paths, redundancy, over-restrictiveness, missing orderings) with flawless logical analysis. Hypotheses are plausible, diverse, and directly tied to anomalies (e.g., directionality error in responded_existence precisely pinpointed). SQL queries are syntactically perfect PostgreSQL, directly verify model anomalies and intended flow deviations (e.g., #2 tests noncoexistence violation; #3/#4 probe responded_existence; #7 tests existence(C); extras like #8-10/#13-15 insightfully extend to business logic without straying). Usage summary ties results to model refinement. Zero inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws; exceeds requirements in depth while staying independent and focused.
