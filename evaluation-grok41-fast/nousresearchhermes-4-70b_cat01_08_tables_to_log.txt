**6.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (supporting partial credit)**:
  - Correctly identifies `order_id` as Case ID.
  - Derives appropriate activities matching prompt examples ("Order Created", "Items Picked" per line item – meaningful granularity), "Order Dispatched"/"Order Arrived" per delivery record, "Invoice Issued" per invoice, "Payment Received" per payment with correct join via `invoice_id` to get `order_id`.
  - Timestamps are accurately mapped and chronological within shown cases (e.g., 1001, 1002 events flow correctly: create  pick  dispatch  arrive  invoice  pay).
  - Includes Resource column with correct IDs (SP/WH/CR/BL; blank for payments – accurate as no data).
  - Other Attributes are relevant, sparse but logically placed (e.g., `item_id`/`quantity` only for picks; `delivery_note`/`delivery_id` for deliveries; `invoice_amount`/`invoice_id` for invoices/payments; `customer_id`/`order_priority` for creates).
  - Markdown table format correct, sorted by Case ID then Timestamp.
  - Handles splits (multi-lines, multi-deliveries, multi-invoices/payments) properly.
  - No criminal/illegal content; follows policies.

- **Major Flaws (significant deductions)**:
  - **Incomplete event log (primary failure)**: Table truncates mid-case 1003 (only ~19 rows shown vs. required ~33 events across all 5 cases). Missing all remaining events for 1003 (picks, dispatch/arrive, invoice, payment), entire cases 1004 (2 events) and 1005 (7 events). Violates "Ensure that every event for every `order_id` is included" and "every event for every `order_id`".
  - No explicit documentation of assumptions (e.g., one pick event per line; dispatch/arrive per delivery; payments joined via invoice; resource blank for payments; no resource for arrivals specifically). Prompt requires "document any assumptions made" if missing/ambiguous – absent in final output.
  - Sparse table is wide (14 columns) but workable; however, no summary or note on sparsity/usage for process mining, minor unclarity.
  - Minor logical: "Items Picked" used even for single items (ok, but could specify per-item); no enrichment from optional Products/Resources tables to names (prompt recommends descriptive but IDs suffice; still, missed opportunity for "enrich").
  - No handling/mention of order 1004's incompleteness (no delivery/invoice/payment – correct omission but undocumented).

- **Why not higher/lower?**: Structure/logic nearly flawless where complete (~80% accuracy in shown data), but incompleteness is a core task failure (not "comprehensive"). Strictness demands ~35% deduction for missing ~40% of events + no assumptions doc. Not 10.0 (not flawless); not <5.0 (partial log usable for demo). 

Perfect score requires full table + assumptions note.
