**10.0**

This process tree is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It perfectly captures all observed traces in the event log with 100% fitness:  
- Case 2: RA  VF  AE   (silent skip)  AD  SC  AC  
- Case 1: RA  VF  AE  (*('RMI', ) once: RMI  exit)  VF  AD  SC  AC  
- Case 3: RA  VF  AE  (*('RMI', ) twice: RMI   (silent)  RMI  exit)  VF  AD  SC  AC  

Visible traces match exactly ( invisible), including consecutive RMI's via the loop's semantics (* (A, B): A then (exit | B  A)*, with B= enabling 1 consecutive RMI's without interleaving activities).  

Precision is high: forbids deviations (e.g., no AD before AE/VF re-do; no RMI outside loop; exactly one re-VF after RMI(s); no extra loops/VF's; SC/AC only at end). Allows minor generalizations (3 RMI's), acceptable for discovery.  

Simplicity is optimal: minimal operators/ usage; linear sequence with single optional XOR-loop branch balances the "optional repeating loop for missing information and re-validation" + main flow. Notation precisely follows prompt style (binary-ish nesting, multi-child sequences valid per code example), parses unambiguously (outer (RA, (VF, (AE, (X, AD)), (SC, AC)))), no code needed. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws.
