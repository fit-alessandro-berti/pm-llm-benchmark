**5.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Major logical flaw in fitness (primary deduction: -3.0 from 10.0)**: The proposed loop `* (tau, -> ('RMI', 'VF'))` generates traces like  (empty via tau exit), RMIVF, or RMIVFRMIVF, etc. It **cannot produce the observed Case 3 trace after AE: RMIRMIVF** (two consecutive RMI followed by a single VF). After the first RMI, the sequence forces VF before any loop decision, making consecutive RMI impossible. Yet the answer explicitly claims it "captures... Case 3, where 'RMI' occurs twice" (twice in explanation)—direct inaccuracy and false claim. Fitness fails for 1/3 traces, violating "balances fitness" requirement.
- **Unclear/incorrect visual representation (-1.0)**: Diagram incorrectly positions `-> AD` as a direct child/sibling under `*`, misleadingly suggesting AD inside/under the loop body. Actual tree has AD in sequence *after* the loop. Structural miscommunication.
- **Extra content beyond task (-0.5)**: Task demands "**just the final structure, no code that needs to be executed**". Answer adds lengthy explanation, bullet points, and visual—unrequested bloat, potentially confusing.
- **Minor inaccuracies (-0.5)**: Labels use abbreviations ('RA', 'VF') instead of full log names ('Receive Application (RA)', etc.), reducing clarity. Loop rationale ignores Case 3 timestamps/logical sequencing (two RMI requests before single re-validation).
- **Partial positives (no add-back; baseline only)**: Captures Cases 1-2 perfectly, main sequence RAVFAE...AC, optional loop intent, simplicity. Balances precision/simplicity somewhat but sacrifices fitness.

Nearly flawless requires perfect log fit + minimalism—no such here. 5.0 reflects "decent attempt, major flaws prevent passing strict criteria."
