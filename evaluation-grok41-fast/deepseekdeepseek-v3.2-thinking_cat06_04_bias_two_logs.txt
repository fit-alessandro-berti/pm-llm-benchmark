**9.5**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Accuracy (Near Perfect, Minor Nitpick: -0.5)**: All factual claims match the logs precisely (e.g., Group A: no adjustments, all LocalResident=FALSE; Group B: +10 boost only for Highland Civic Darts Club locals; key comparison P002@710 Rejected vs. U003@705 Approved highlights disparate impact with *final* scores where boosted 705 > non-boosted threshold implied by 710 rejection). No inventions or errors. "Proxy discrimination" via LocalResident/CommunityGroup is exactly correct per question's focus. U001's unnecessary boost and U002's parity with P002 further validate systematic favoritism without contradiction.
  
- **Clarity and Structure (Flawless)**: Logical breakdown (mechanism  proxy  impact  process differences  conclusion) is crisp, uses tables/logs directly, avoids verbosity post-think tag. Terms like "Community Boost" and "parallel processes" are precise and illuminating.

- **Logical Completeness (Flawless)**: Addresses *all* question elements: identifies **Group B's log** as exhibiting bias (correct, as it uniquely shows the discriminatory adjustment absent in Group A's neutral log); explains manifestation via ScoreAdjustment, LocalResident/CommunityGroup; links to systematic decision differences (e.g., lower-qualified U003 approved via boost). No gaps; anticipates counterarguments (boost not inherently bad, but eligibility is).

- **No Penalized Flaws**: No unclarities (e.g., explicitly notes "final score" impact), no logical leaps (705<710 but approved = clear disparity), no overreach (doesn't assume unshown thresholds). Ignores think tag as instructed. Only microscopic deduction for phrasing "bias manifests through a systematic *advantage* given to [Group B]" – while spot-on, "exhibits bias" could hyper-literally point to Group A's *disadvantaged* outcomes, but contextually/context of comparison makes this pedantic.

This is exemplary; 10.0 reserved for zero conceivable quibbles.
