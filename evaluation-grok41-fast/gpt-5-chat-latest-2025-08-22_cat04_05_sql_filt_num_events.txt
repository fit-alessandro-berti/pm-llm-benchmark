**9.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Correctness (flawless)**: The SQL query is logically perfect. The CTE accurately computes event counts per `case_id`, the JOIN correctly preserves all columns/events (`e.*`), and the `WHERE c.event_count <= 6` precisely filters to include only cases with 6 events while excluding >6. It handles grouping/filtering exactly as required, works in DuckDB, and returns the full event set for qualifying cases. No execution flaws, inefficiencies for the task, or edge cases missed (e.g., cases with 0-6 events, multiple events per case).
  
- **Completeness**: Fully addresses the task—no missing elements like assuming extra columns or failing to return all events.

- **Clarity/Precision (minor deductions)**: 
  - Explanation is structured and accurate overall, but point 3's phrasing "greater than 6" is correct while the summary "(6 events)" introduces slight unclarity/imprecision—it implies *exactly* 6 rather than "six or fewer" (6) as stated in the prompt. Hypercritically, this is a minor logical flaw in wording that could mislead a pedantic reader.
  - Unnecessary offer to "optimize... without a CTE" adds extraneous content (task doesn't request alternatives or compactness), slightly diluting focus.

- **Style/Conciseness**: Clean code block, good formatting. No verbosity issues beyond the offer.

- **Overall**: Nearly flawless (query/explanation core is exemplary), but minor imprecision/unnecessary extra warrants deduction from 10.0 per "hypercritical" strictness—even tiny issues must impact significantly. Equivalent flawless would have zero such nits (e.g., "(6 events)").
