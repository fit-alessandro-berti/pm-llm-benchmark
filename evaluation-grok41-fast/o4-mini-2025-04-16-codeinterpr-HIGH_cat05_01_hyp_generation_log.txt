**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (supporting high base score):**
- **Structure and Completeness**: Perfectly mirrors the 3-step prompt structure. Anomalies clearly tied to specific cases/tables with timestamps/evidence. Hypotheses directly map to prompt examples (policy violations, training, system errors). Queries form a logical "suite" covering deviations, root causes (type/value/resource clustering, timings), PostgreSQL-specific syntax (FILTER, LAG, EXCEPT, EXTRACT(EPOCH)). Covers joins to `orders`/`resources` appropriately. Closing summary ties back to hypotheses excellently.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Accurately flags key issues (out-of-order in 1002/1003/1004, skips/misses). References `additional_info` implicitly (e.g., `shipment_scheduled=N`).
- **Hypotheses**: Concise, relevant (e.g., priority auto-skip, training gaps, timestamps, automation). Covers spectrum without speculation.
- **Queries Overall**: Actionable, parameterized, build on each other (e.g., reuse CTEs). A/C/D/G/H are flawless/correct. Test hypotheses directly (E~type, F~resources/training, G~value/automation, B/H~order/timing errors).

**Flaws/Deductions (strict penalties for any inaccuracy/unclear/logical error; -1.8 total from 10.0):**
- **Anomalies (-0.3)**: Incomplete/exaggerated. 1002: "Missing ... Validate Stock prior" – not missing (exists at 09:15, just late/out-of-order); imprecise wording. 1004: Misses explicit flags like no "Perform Credit Check"/"Validate Stock" entirely (huge skips), focuses only on payment/invoice + N-flag. No mention of 1004's premature payment post-register only. Minor unclarity in phrasing.
- **Hypotheses (-0.2)**: Good but generic/untied to data (e.g., no link to `credit_score=650` in 1002 or `shipment_scheduled=N`; ignores `order_type`/`value` specifics despite data). No `additional_info`-driven causes (e.g., low-score bypass).
- **Queries (-1.3 total)**:
  - **F: Invalid SQL (-0.6)**: Critical error – `SELECT r.resource_id` + `GROUP BY r.resource_id` but no `r` alias (JOIN is `res`). Query fails syntax. `COUNT(*)` counts rows, not unique resources uniquely if multiples. Unrunnable = major inaccuracy.
  - **E: Logical flaw in metric (-0.4)**: `pct_of_all_cases = COUNT(*) / total_orders` (per `order_type`) meaningless for hypothesis ("mostly priority?"). Shows raw fraction of *all* orders, not *within-type %* (e.g., hides if priority has 100% anomaly rate but few cases). Misleads clustering test; should be `COUNT(a.*) *1.0 / COUNT(o.*)` per group.
  - **B: Unclear/logical confusion (-0.2)**: `OR (activity = 'Ship Goods' AND prev_act = 'Perform Credit Check')` catches *normal* CCShip (per comment "if CC must precede"), contradicting anomaly detection. Example misfires; LAG only checks immediate prev (misses non-adjacent out-of-order).
  - **Minor nits (-0.1)**: No queries for `additional_info` (e.g., low `credit_score` correlation, `shipment_scheduled=N` flags). H assumes both events exist (NULL if missing CC). G's LEFT JOINs work but overcomplicated (direct subquery simpler).
- **General (-0.0)**: No criminal/scope issues. Concise, no fluff.

**Why not lower?** Flaws don't invalidate core value (90%+ queries perfect, suite still investigative). **Why not 9+?** Syntax errors + logical metric issues = "not nearly flawless" (unrunnable F alone drops from elite). 8.2 reflects excellent but critically impaired execution.
