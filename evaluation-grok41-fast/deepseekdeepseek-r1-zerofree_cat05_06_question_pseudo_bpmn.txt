**10.0**

The provided answer delivers precisely 20 open-ended, thought-provoking questions in a clean, numbered list format matching the prompt's "just list the questions" instruction. All questions are phrased as "How" or "What" inquiries, ensuring openness. They comprehensively cover the required areas—rationale (e.g., Q1, Q2, Q6), potential improvements (e.g., Q5, Q7, Q9), risk management (e.g., Q3, Q5, Q20), decision-making (e.g., Q8, Q10, Q15), stakeholder communication (Q16), and performance measurement (Q17)—while tying directly or logically to BPMN elements (parallel gateways, exclusive gateways, specific tasks/countries/markets). No SQL queries or extraneous content. Minor extensions (e.g., Q18–Q20) enhance depth without straying, as they probe risks/improvements inherent to the described global process. No inaccuracies, unclarities, repetitions, or flaws; strictly flawless execution.
