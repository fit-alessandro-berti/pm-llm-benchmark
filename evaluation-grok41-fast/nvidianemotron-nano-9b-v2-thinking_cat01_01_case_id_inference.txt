**8.2**

### Justification for Grade (Strict Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**: 
  - Correctly identifies **exactly three cases** based on unique patient demographics (45M, 62F, 28M), which are unambiguous anchors—no other groupings possible.
  - **Logical sequences** are nearly perfect: Each case follows a coherent hospital journey (registration  triage/consult  diagnostics/treatment  discharge), with timestamps in strict chronological order per case.
  - **All attributes align perfectly** (e.g., 45M's X-ray  fracture diagnosis; 62F's lab request  infection diagnosis  antibiotics; 28M's knee surgery flow).
  - **Departmental consistency** spot-on (ER/Radiology for 45M/62F; Surgery for 28M).
  - **Presentation flawless**: Clear, structured format with sequences, key inferences, and explicit event lists. Claims of no overlaps/missing events are directionally true (17/18 covered uniquely).
  - Covers **17 out of 18 events correctly** with zero overlaps or misassignments.

- **Flaws (deducting from 10.0)**:
  - **Major inaccuracy**: Event 10 (Lab test completed, 62F, timestamp 08:20:27Z) is **missing from Case 2's event list** (listed as 2,5,8,11,14,17 instead of 2,5,8,**10**,11,14,17). This is a logical gap—lab requested (8) directly precedes completion (10), before consult (11). Total: 17/18 events grouped (94.4% accuracy).
  - **Self-contradiction**: Final statement claims "without overlapping or **missing events**," but event 10 is ungrouped. Minor unclarity in Case 2 sequence (skips lab completion).
  - No other issues: No wrong assignments, no invented cases, timings/depts/flows correct.

- **Why not lower?** Omission is isolated (obvious fit in Case 2; doesn't break other logic). Instructions allow crediting corrections/self-awareness, but none here—still "nearly flawless" overall (not "any inaccuracies" plural).
- **Why not 10.0/9.5?** Strict per rubric: One clear inaccuracy (missing event + false claim) prevents "nearly flawless." Equivalent to ~5% error in core task (group **all** events). Hypercritical deduction: -1.8 points.
