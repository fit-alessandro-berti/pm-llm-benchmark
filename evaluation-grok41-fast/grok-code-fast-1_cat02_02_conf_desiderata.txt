### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
This answer is exceptionally strong—structured per case, directly addressing all three task elements with precise references to rules, log timestamps, and constraints. It correctly identifies:
- **Normative violations**: Case 1 & 3: None (flawless). Case 2: Three accurate violations (reordering Risk before Credit; skipping mandatory Inform Applicant post-Decision; prohibited Finalize after rejection). No misses or inventions.
- **Desiderata failures**: Correctly flags for all cases (no Follow-up Calls everywhere; Case 3 timing delays with exact ~49h/51h calcs; Case 2 timing technically met but contextualized). Consistently clarifies "suboptimal/not severe," aligning perfectly with "desiderata" distinction.
- **Interpretations/justifications**: Plausible, grounded (e.g., human error/system glitch for Case 2; workload for Case 3), without overreaching or contradicting rules.

**Minor deductions (hypercritical lens, preventing 10.0)**:
- **Slight unclarity in Case 2 Desiderata**: States "Credit Check... within 24 hours... though after Risk Assessment" and "no Inform Applicant... to evaluate timing," which is logically fine but mildly redundant/repetitive since normative skip already noted—could be tighter without losing info.
- **Assumption on Follow-up Call**: Inferring absence for Cases 1/2 (not explicitly logged like Case 3) is reasonable (logs show only listed activities), but hypercritically, doesn't explicitly note "inferred from log omission" vs. Case 3's explicit note—minor transparency gap.
- **No explicit summary of "which cases" upfront**: Task says "Identify which cases are violating... and... fail to meet desiderata." Per-case is clear, but a top-level bullet summary (e.g., "Normative: Only Case 2; Desiderata: All three") would be more direct—logical flaw in scoping, though conclusions are unambiguous.

No factual errors, logical flaws, or inaccuracies. Self-contained, professional. Only these tiny structural/polish issues prevent perfection.
