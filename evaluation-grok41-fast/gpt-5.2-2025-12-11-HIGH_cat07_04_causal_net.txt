**9.8**

### Reasoning for Grade
- **Strengths (excellent overall)**:
  - **Accuracy**: Perfectly captures the core flow (a  b/c/d  e  g/h  z) and the rework loop (f feedback). Matches the diagram exactly.
  - **Completeness**: Covers all nodes (a–h, z, f), convergence/branching logic, and outcomes. Includes the legend's key explanation of black-dot gateways (XOR/AND/OR splits/joins).
  - **Clarity & Structure**: Well-organized with sections for flow and notation. Concise yet descriptive; uses bolding for readability.
  - **Insight**: Correctly identifies it as a Petri net/workflow style with splits/merges, and notes loop/rework semantics.

- **Minor Deductions (-0.2)**:
  - Doesn't map *specific* gateway types to diagram locations (e.g., is a's branch an OR-split? e's an XOR-split?). Legend is summarized generically, not tied to exact positions/arrows.
  - Could note parallel potential (e.g., AND paths if used post-e or elsewhere), but implied.

This is publication-ready quality—near-perfect for grading a diagram description.
