The provided query is correct, efficient, clear, and precisely fulfills the requirements without any inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. It accurately identifies qualifying `case_id`s via aggregation in a subquery (`GROUP BY` with `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`), then retrieves the full event rows for those cases via an inner `JOIN` using `USING (case_id)`, ensuring only events from cases with 6 events are returned. No extraneous columns, no incorrect filtering, handles all edge cases (e.g., cases with 0-6 events included, >6 excluded), and uses idiomatic DuckDB-compatible SQL syntax. No rescan issues impact correctness, and no optimizations are mandated by the prompt. Flawless execution.
