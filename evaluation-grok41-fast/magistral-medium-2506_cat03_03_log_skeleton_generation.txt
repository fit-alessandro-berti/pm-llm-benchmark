**7.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**:
  - Correct Python dictionary structure: All required keys present; equivalence, always_before, always_after, never_together, directly_follows are sets of tuples; activ_freq is dict of sets. All 10 activities covered in activ_freq.
  - Logical sequence matches scenario: RO  CA  RI  PI  QC  PO  GSL  D  IC  (RP). always_before correctly captures reverse relations (e.g., ('PI', 'RI') properly means RI before PI).
  - directly_follows accurately reflects a plausible direct sequence for the linear process.
  - Reasonable activ_freq: Most {1} for mandatory steps; {0,1} for plausibly optional QC/RP aligns with scenario nuances (QC potentially skippable in "complex" process; RP conditional on payment).
  - Empty equivalence and never_together appropriate—no equivalents or exclusions implied.
  - Comprehensive coverage without extraneous constraints.

- **Flaws (strict deductions, preventing 10.0 or 9.0)**:
  - **Major logical inconsistency (deduct 1.5)**: activ_freq allows QC=0 and RP=0, but directly_follows includes ('PI', 'QC') and ('IC', 'RP'), forcing QC/RP=1 whenever PI/IC occur (which is always, per {1}). This renders constraints mutually unsatisfiable—e.g., a QC-skipped trace violates directly_follows despite satisfying activ_freq. No alternatives (e.g., ('PI', 'PO')) added for branches. Fatal for a valid process model.
  - **Incomplete always_after (deduct 0.8)**: Effectively empty despite clear forward relations (e.g., ('RO', 'CA'), ('RI', 'PI')). Prompt defines it distinctly; "implied" excuse ignores explicit need for symmetry/post-order enforcement.
  - **Minor unclarities/oversights (deduct 0.5 total)**: QC described as mandatory-ish in scenario ("inspected to ensure"), yet {0,1}; no transitive always_before/after (e.g., ('D', 'RI')) but not required; code syntax assumes proper {} closure (minor formatting in text).
  
Nearly flawless would require consistent constraints (e.g., QC/RP {1} or branched directs) and populated always_after. 7.2 reflects strong overall but penalized heavily for core incoherence per strict criteria.
