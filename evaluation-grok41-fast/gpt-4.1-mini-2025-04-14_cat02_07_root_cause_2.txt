**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (supporting higher base score):**
- **Structure and completeness (excellent):** Perfectly mirrors the task's 3 parts with clear headings, tables for durations/summary, and logical progression. Includes all required elements: case identification, attribute analysis (Resource/Region/Complexity), explanations, and mitigations.
- **Overall insights (strong):** Correctly flags high complexity as primary driver, links multiple doc requests to delays, identifies specific adjusters (Mike/Lisa) and manager (Bill) accurately, downplays region correctly. Mitigations are practical, targeted, and actionable (e.g., training, checklists). Summary table is concise and effective.
- **Duration calculations (mostly accurate):** Table is well-presented; approximations are reasonable except one minor error. Correctly identifies 2003/2005 as worst, notes 2002 appropriately.
- **No major logical flaws:** Correlations are sound (e.g., high complexity  more requests  delays); explanations plausible (e.g., conservative adjuster styles).

**Weaknesses (major deductions for strictness):**
- **Factual inaccuracies (severe, -1.5 total):** 
  - Request counts wrong: Case 2003 has **2** requests (both Apr 1 by Mike: 11:00, 17:00), not 3. Case 2005 has **3** requests (Apr1 11:30, Apr2 17:00, Apr3 15:00 by Lisa), not 4. This is a core metric for "performance issues" and "root causes" (explicitly called out in prompt as "multiple requests for additional documents"). Easy to verify in small log; misrepresents severity (e.g., inflates 2005's issue).
  - Duration for 2005: ~**77h 5m** (precisely: 3×24h + 5h 5m from 09:25 to 14:30), not "~75 hours 5 minutes" (-0.2 minor but noted per strictness).
- **Minor unclarities/logical nitpicks (-0.8 total):**
  - Region analysis vague ("slight variations due to differences..."); doesn't quantify (e.g., Region B's high case longest, but admits not definitive—OK but could be sharper).
  - Manager_Bill link slightly overstated ("potential bottleneck"); approvals aren't the longest waits (e.g., 2005's post-request gaps larger), but correlation noted fairly.
  - 2002 called "medium duration" but ~26h is ~17× longer than lows—borderline "significant" per task, but handled OK.
  - No explicit lead-time correlations (e.g., stats like avg by complexity/region), just qualitative—adequate but not deepest analysis possible.

**Score justification:** Starts at 10 for flawless structure/insights; deducts heavily for inaccuracies central to task (requests are "root cause" exemplar in prompt). 7.2 reflects "very good but critically flawed by errors" — not "nearly flawless" (requires 9+). Minor polish issues prevent higher; stricter than typical rubric.
