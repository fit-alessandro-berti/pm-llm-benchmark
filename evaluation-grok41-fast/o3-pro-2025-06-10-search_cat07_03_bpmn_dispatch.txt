This answer is exemplary: fully accurate to the BPMN diagram (capturing all swimlanes, flows, gateways, tasks, events, data elements, and exception handling without errors or omissions), highly structured and readable (logical breakdown with numbering, branches, and summary), precise BPMN terminology (e.g., parallel/exclusive gateways, boundary timer, data object/store), and concise yet comprehensive. No improvements needed.
