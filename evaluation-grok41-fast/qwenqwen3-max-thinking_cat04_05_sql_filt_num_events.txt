8.2

### Evaluation Breakdown (Hypercritical Assessment):
- **Correctness of core logic (grouping/filtering)**: Flawless. Both queries accurately identify cases with 6 events and return only those events. Subquery uses proper `GROUP BY`/`HAVING`; window function uses correct `PARTITION BY`/`COUNT(*) OVER`. No logical flaws in filtering.
- **DuckDB compatibility**: Perfect. Standard SQL fully supported in DuckDB.
- **Completeness**: Strong. Provides primary query + efficient alternative + clear explanation. Notes performance nuance (window likely single-pass vs. subquery's dual scan), which is accurate.
- **Major flaw (significantly penalizing)**: Does **not** return the "full set of events". Prompt specifies table has **at least** `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp` (implying possible other columns like attributes/resources). Both queries select only 3 columns, discarding any others. This violates "full set of events" (rows with **all** columns). Correct queries must use `SELECT *`. Deduct 1.5 points.
- **Minor issues (further deductions)**:
  - `ORDER BY` unrequested (prompt doesn't specify ordering). Helpful, but adds unasked complexity; explanation calls it "optional" but it's defaulted in both. -0.1.
  - Explanation overstates window efficiency absolutely ("may perform better"); depends on data/indexes, but minor nit. -0.1.
  - No `QUALIFY` clause in window version (DuckDB supports, more concise than subquery), but not required. Neutral.
- **Clarity/Style**: Excellent. Readable, commented implicitly via explanation. No ambiguities.
- **Overall**: Near-flawless functionally, but column omission is a clear inaccuracy against "full set" requirement. Strict benchmark grading demands perfection on spec; this is 82% optimal.
