**9.8/10.0**

### Grading Rationale
- **Accuracy (3.0/3.0)**: Near-perfect match to the diagram. All major elements (main flowchart sequences, HIS hub, chemical/class test paths, loops, side panels (b), table (c)) are correctly identified and broken down. Minor interpretive phrasing (e.g., "speech act theory or HL7") aligns well with labels like "performative" and healthcare context—no factual errors or hallucinations.
- **Comprehensiveness (3.0/3.0)**: Covers every section exhaustively: overall structure, step-by-step flows (with textual diagrams), dependencies, feedback loops, table details, and takeaways. No key visuals omitted (e.g., numbered arrows, channels, "Do test again").
- **Clarity & Structure (2.0/2.0)**: Highly organized with headings, bullet points, tables, and breakdowns. Readable, logical progression from whole to parts.
- **Insight & Value-Add (1.5/1.5)**: Adds useful context (e.g., medical informatics, UML-like style) without speculation. Offers extensions (e.g., Mermaid redraw).
- **Conciseness (0.3/0.5)**: Excellent detail but slightly verbose in textual flowcharts (could trim for punchiness); deduct 0.2 only.
