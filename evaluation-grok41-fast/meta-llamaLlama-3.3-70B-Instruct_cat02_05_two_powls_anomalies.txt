**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high base score):**
  - **Structure and completeness**: Excellently organized with clear sections for each model, anomalies, and comparison/conclusion. Addresses all task elements (analysis, anomaly identification with severity hints, choice + justification based on correctness/integrity).
  - **Correct choice of Model 1 as closer**: Logically sound. Model 1 preserves causal screening  {interview, decide}, mandatory chain to payroll/close. Model 2's optional payroll (existential threat to integrity) and non-causal screening are worse than Model 1's optional interview/parallel decide-interview.
  - **Key anomalies identified accurately**:
    - Model 1: Decision sans interview (direct path), illogical parallel (spot-on).
    - Model 2: Interviews pre-screening (possible via Post  Interview), loop (unnecessary repetition), payroll skip (called "most severe" – correct, violates employee compensation essence).
  - **Justification strong**: Ties anomalies to "logical flow," "process integrity," "correctness" explicitly. Model 1 deviations suboptimal but non-omissive; Model 2 omissive/optional core steps.

- **Inaccuracies/Unclarities (significant deductions, -1.8 total)**:
  - **Model 2 flow misdescribed (major, -0.8)**: Claims "allows for either screening or interviews to happen first, or potentially in parallel" – partially true (Post  both enables concurrency/any order), but ignores **critical fact: no outgoing edges from Screen**. Screen is dangling/isolated post-Post; no causal Screen  Interview/Decide. Traces easily omit Screen (Post  Interview  Decide  ...), or do it concurrently without impact. This makes screening pointless/optional/non-preceding – worse anomaly than stated "interviews before screening" (which it covers superficially but not causally). Symmetric Interview dangling in Model 1 noted implicitly via "without interviews"; missed here.
  - **Missed Model 2 anomaly: No causal screening  decision/interview (-0.5)**: Explicitly unstated. Post  Interview  Decide enables hire sans screen (fundamentally violates normative "screen before interview"). Answer implies via "before screening" but doesn't call out as parallel/optional screening flaw, understating severity vs. Model 1 (where Screen  both).
  - **Loop semantics imprecise (-0.3)**: Describes as "onboarding can be repeated... iterative or corrective... start over from beginning" – vague/speculative. Actual LOOP(Onboard, skip) = 1+ Onboards with silents between (do Onboard; repeat: silent  Onboard or exit). Not "start over" but redundant multi-onboardings; anomaly severity diluted by "could be interpreted as... corrective."
  - **Minor phrasing ambiguities (-0.2)**: Model 1 "parallel with or after the initial screening" – unclear ("parallel with screening"? No, after Screen, concurrent with Decide). Model 2 "begins similarly" – not similar (Model 1 Post  Screen  ..., Model 2 splits immediately).

- **Logical flaws (minor, -0.2)**: Downplays Model 1 anomalies slightly ("could be reasonable... depending on specifics") despite normative task focus – injects subjectivity, though later critiques them.

Nearly flawless would require exhaustive causal analysis (e.g., linear extensions, required vs. optional nodes, dangling nodes symmetrically), precise operator semantics, zero phrasing issues. Strong but flawed by incomplete Model 2 critique (dangling/no-causal Screen central to why Model 2 worse). 10.0 impossible; 9+ only for perfection.
