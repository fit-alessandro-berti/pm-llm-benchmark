**8.2**

### Justification for Grade (Internal Evaluation Notes)
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**: Exceptional structure with clear sections, tables, LaTeX diagrams, and comprehensive coverage of task elements (standard reference, per-model analysis, anomaly severity ranking, comparative verdict, justification table, final recommendation). Conclusion correctly identifies Model 1 as superior, with sound reasoning on core issues (e.g., Interview-Decide ordering in Model 1 as moderate; Model 2's lack of ScreenInterview/Decide, optional Payroll, problematic loop). Aligns well with normative logic (screening prerequisite, mandatory steps, no skips/loops on core activities).
- **Weaknesses (deductions totaling -1.8)**:
  - **Inaccuracy on Model 2 edges (-0.6)**: Claims "**Post  Screen** – *missing* in the PO (the edge is not added)", but code explicitly has `model2.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)`. Direct misreading of provided model; undermines analysis credibility despite correct inference on implications.
  - **Inaccuracy on loop semantics (-0.8)**: Repeatedly states loop allows "skipping [Onboarding] altogether" / "optional onboarding" / "leave the employee never fully onboarded". False—POWL `*(Onboard, skip)` mandates Onboard 1 time (first child always executed initially; skip only enables repetition). Correctly flags repetition risk but fabricates skip option, inflating anomaly severity incorrectly.
  - **Minor unclarities/logical nitpicks (-0.4)**: Reference flow shows `Interview & Decide` (parallel) but later treats InterviewDecide as strict normative constraint without clarifying; Model 1 "no loop" flagged as low anomaly despite not being required in standard linear flow.
- **Overall**: Near-flawless in insight, logic flow, and task fulfillment; errors are specific/model-specific but do not invert conclusion or core arguments. Hypercritical adjustment from 10.0 baseline yields 8.2—strong but not "nearly flawless" due to factual model misreads.
