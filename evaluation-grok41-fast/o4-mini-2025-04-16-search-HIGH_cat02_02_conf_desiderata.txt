**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is strong overall—structured, tabular, comprehensive, accurate on core identifications, and aligned with the task. It correctly flags **only Case 2** for normative violations (3 clear ones: order reversal on Risk/Credit, missing mandatory Inform Applicant, forbidden Finalize post-rejection), confirms Cases 1/3 compliant, details desiderata deviations across all cases with precise time calcs, clarifies non-severity ("nonbinding," "noncritical," "does not breach"), and provides plausible justifications. Summary ties it together well. **Nearly flawless**, but hypercritical deductions for minor issues:

#### Strengths (Supporting High Score)
- **Part 1 (Normative)**: Perfect identification (only Case 2). Explanations precise/logical (e.g., sequence rules directly quoted/applied; catches implicit pre-closure Inform req.). No false positives (Case 3 delays correctly excluded).
- **Part 2 (Desiderata)**: Exhaustive table covers all (timings, follow-up). Accurate calcs (Case 3: ~49h credit, ~51h inform). Clarifies suboptimal/non-severe (e.g., note, "impact customer experience").
- **Part 3 (Interpretations)**: Creative yet constraint-aligned (e.g., Case 2 "preliminary screening" explains out-of-order without excusing; Case 3 "backlog/unreachability" fits delays). "When possible" covered deviations.
- Structure: Tables enhance clarity; summary crisp/accurate.
- No major inaccuracies/flaws: All log details matched (timestamps, activities, decisions).

#### Deductions (Strict/Hypercritical—Total -0.8)
1. **Minor unclarity/logical phrasing flaw (-0.3)**: Part 1, violation a) explanation: "Credit Check  Risk Assessment" (missing "before" or arrow). Readable via context, but grammatically incomplete/unpolished; hypercritically, risks misparse as non-sequence.
2. **Table formatting artifact (-0.1)**: Part 1 table's spurious "| — |" empty row—distracting markdown error.
3. **Inconsistent terminology (-0.2)**: Part 2 table "Status" column mixes "Met"/"Violated"/"Omitted (recommended)"/"N/A". Clear intent, but lacks uniformity (e.g., standardize to "Met/Violated/Omitted"); minor professionalism hit.
4. **Slight overlap/redundancy (-0.1)**: Part 2 lists Case 2 "Inform Applicant" as desideratum "Omitted" (N/A timing), despite being normative violation (already in Part 1). Not wrong, but blurs strict distinction; could omit.
5. **Minor omission in Part 3 (-0.1)**: Justifications only for Cases 2/3 deviations; Case 1's observed "Follow-up Omitted" (desideratum) gets no interpretation (e.g., "smooth case, no alignment issues needed"). Task says "for the observed behaviors... when possible"—arguably possible here.

No other issues (e.g., no calc errors, no missed violations like Case 2's implicit "close without Inform," no normative creep into desiderata, no unjustified excuses). 9.2 reflects "nearly flawless" with pedantic nits significantly but proportionally dinged (not tanked to <9).
