**6.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (why not lower):** Clear structure matching the task (sections 1-3 + summary). Correctly identifies Case 2's two explicit normative violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection), matching log annotations. Correctly classifies Case 3 timings as desiderata only (not normative). Case 1 implicitly compliant. Good use of bolding/timestamps for clarity. Interpretations restate issues with some context (e.g., "logical error", "suboptimal").
- **Major Flaws (significant penalty):** 
  - **Critical inaccuracy/logical omission:** Case 2 completely skips "Inform Applicant" (required after every Loan Decision per normative sequence: "...Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  ..."; "must be informed"; no skipping allowed). This is a clear normative violation (skipping required step), yet unmentioned anywhere. Case 2 has *at least* three normative violations, not two. This invalidates the completeness of Task 1.
  - **Desiderata inconsistency:** Lists 3 violations for Case 3 (delays + no Follow-up Call) but summary claims only "2" (omits Follow-up). Case 1/2 also lack Follow-up Call (desiderata: "encouraged"), yet only Case 3 flagged—unbalanced, fails to fully "identify which cases fail desiderata."
  - **No/poor justifications (Task 3):** Mostly restates violations as "serious"/"suboptimal" without "suggest[ing] interpretations or justifications *in line with* constraints" (e.g., no "possible urgent preliminary risk due to high-risk applicant" for Case 2 early Risk; ignores Case 1 entirely).
- **Minor Flaws (additional penalties):** Typos/unclarities (e.g., "14:00  14:00"; "Application  Credit Check" missing symbols; duplicate spacing). Case 2 desiderata wrongly claims "no violations" despite skipped Inform failing "promptly inform" recommendation. No explicit Case 1 analysis despite task implying coverage.
- **Overall:** Not "nearly flawless"—major omission undermines core analysis; structure can't compensate. Strict deduction for incompleteness/logic gaps yields 6.0 (solid partial credit, but flawed conclusions).
