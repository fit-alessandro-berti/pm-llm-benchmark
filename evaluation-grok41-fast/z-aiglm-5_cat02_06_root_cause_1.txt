**10.0**

The provided answer is exemplary and fully addresses the task with precision, accuracy, and depth. All durations are correctly calculated and presented clearly. Long cases (102, 104, 105) are accurately identified as outliers relative to the short ones (101, 103). Root causes are logically derived from the log with exact timestamp gaps (e.g., 28h escalation queue in 105, 19h overnight gaps across long cases, 3.5h L1 delay in 104), distinguishing patterns like escalation-specific delays, systemic overnight bottlenecks, and L1 workload issues without speculation beyond evidence. Explanations tie factors directly to cycle time increases (e.g., afternoon investigations triggering next-day slips). Insights are sharp, and recommendations are actionable, targeted, and process-oriented (e.g., warm handoffs, triage sharpening). Structure mirrors the task perfectly; language is concise, professional, and free of ambiguities, errors, or flaws.
