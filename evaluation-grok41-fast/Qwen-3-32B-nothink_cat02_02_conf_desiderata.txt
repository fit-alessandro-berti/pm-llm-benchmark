**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This grade reflects a solid structural effort (clear sections, table, interpretations) but is dragged down significantly by **major inaccuracies, omissions, logical flaws, and misclassifications** in core task elements. Even though the answer is well-organized and covers ~80% correctly, the misses are critical to the "normative vs. desiderata" distinction and directly contradict the strict rules/desiderata definitions. Per instructions, minor issues lower significantly; these are not minor.

#### **Strengths (Supporting the Score Above 5.0)**
- **Structure & Completeness**: Excellent use of sections, bullet points, process flows, summary table, and interpretations/recommendations. Addresses all 3 task parts explicitly.
- **Case 1**: Nearly flawless. Correctly identifies no normative violations; timings perfect.
- **Case 3 Normative**: Flawless (no violations).
- **Case 3 Desiderata**: Accurate (delays correctly calculated/identified as suboptimal; notes no follow-up).
- **Interpretations (Task 3)**: Thoughtful and on-point where provided (e.g., workload for delays, errors for Case 2).
- **Case 2 Partial Hits**: Correctly flags Risk Assessment before Credit Check and Finalize after rejection as normative violations.

#### **Major Flaws & Deductions (Preventing >7.0)**
1. **Critical Omission: Skipping "Inform Applicant" in Case 2 (Normative Violation)** (-2.5):
   - Log clearly skips this **required step** (no entry after Decision at 09:30; jumps to Finalize at 10:00).
   - Normative rules explicitly mandate it: "Following the loan decision, the applicant **must** be informed"; sequence "Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  ...".
   - This is a **skipping violation** ("What is Not Allowed: Skipping activities"), applicable to **both** approve/reject paths.
   - Answer's Case 2 flow omits it visually but **never flags it as a violation**. Summary table claims only "2 violations" (wrong; at least 3). Process cannot complete without it.

2. **Misclassification: Treats Missing "Inform Applicant" as Desiderata (-1.5)**:
   - In Case 2 Desiderata section: Notes "no 'Inform Applicant' step recorded" but buries it under **desiderata** (timing/follow-up).
   - This conflates **strict normative** (must inform) with soft desiderata (prompt timing). Logical flaw undermines the task's core distinction.

3. **Inaccurate Severity Language for Desiderata (-1.0)**:
   - Case 2: Calls desiderata issues "**Serious desideratum violations**" – contradicts task ("Violating these is **not** considered a serious problem"; "**not severe**, suboptimal").
   - Case 1: Claims "**No desideratum violations**" despite **missing Follow-up Call** (explicitly a desideratum: "encouraged... to perform a Follow-up Call"; all cases miss it, so all fail desiderata to some degree).
   - Inconsistency: Case 3 flags missing call correctly as violation; Case 1 does not. Fails to uniformly "identify which cases fail" + "clarify not severe."

4. **Minor Inaccuracies/Unclarities (-1.0 cumulative)**:
   - Case 2 Desiderata: "Credit Check is delayed (no prior Credit Check at all)" – misleading; it **was** done (at 09:00), just out-of-order (**normative**, not just timing desideratum).
   - No justification/interpretation for missing Inform in Case 2 (task 3 opportunity missed).
   - Extra content (recommendations, BPMN offer): Nice but off-task; slightly dilutes focus.
   - Timings precise elsewhere, but Case 2's lack of Inform timing analysis is incomplete.

#### **Overall Logical Flaws**
- **Undercounts Case 2 Normative Issues**: Lists "2 violations" but misses skip (3+ total: order reversal, improper finalize, skip inform). Case 2 is the "worst" example; answer underplays it.
- **Desiderata Inconsistency**: Task requires identifying **all** failures (incl. universal missing follow-up) and clarifying "suboptimal/not severe." Handled unevenly.
- **No Hyper-Flawlessness**: Not "nearly flawless" – core analysis has gaps that could mislead (e.g., reader thinks Case 2 has only 2 norm issues).

**Rescore Logic**: Base 8.0 for structure/content volume  -2.5 (missed violation)  -1.5 (misclassification)  -1.0 (severity)  -1.0 (minors/inconsistency) = 6.0. A 9+ requires zero such errors.
