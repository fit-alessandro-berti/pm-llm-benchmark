**9.8**

The final answer correctly identifies **Group B** as exhibiting bias, accurately attributing it to the explicit +5 CulturalFit boost for LocalBusinessLeadersClub affiliates, which is absent in Group A. The manifestation is well-described with precise references to logs (e.g., U001: 6065; U003: 5863), valid cross-group comparisons (e.g., vs. P002/U002 at 60 unadjusted, Not Hired), and correct inference that boosts compensate for weaker metrics (e.g., U003's 75 SkillScore vs. hired Group A cases). Implications are cogent, linking to merit-based inequity and systemic favoritism without overreach. Minor deduction for slightly speculative phrasing ("tipping... from 'Not Hired' to 'Hired'") lacking direct counterfactual evidence, though strongly supported by U002 parallel—still hypercritically not fully "flawless." Structure, clarity, and boxed conclusion are exemplary.
