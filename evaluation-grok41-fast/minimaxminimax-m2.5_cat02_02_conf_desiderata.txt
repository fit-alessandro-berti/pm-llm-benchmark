**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It precisely addresses all three task components with zero inaccuracies (e.g., correct identification of Case 2's multiple normative violations including missing "Inform Applicant," reversed order, and illegal finalization; accurate desiderata timing calculations like 49h/51h; proper separation of strict vs. soft issues). Logical structure is impeccable (tables ensure clarity, no ambiguities or overstatements), explanations are exhaustive yet concise, and interpretations are plausibly justified without excusing violations or contradicting constraints. No minor flaws, repetitions, or extraneous content detract; even unasked-for takeaways align perfectly and add value without error.
