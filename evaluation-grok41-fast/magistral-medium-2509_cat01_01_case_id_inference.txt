**10.0**

The final conclusions precisely and correctly group all 18 events into three distinct cases based on patient demographics (unique age/gender combinations), chronological timestamps within each case, logical activity sequences, consistent departments/trajectories, and additional_info alignments (e.g., fracture/X-ray, infection/lab/antibiotics, surgery flow). No events are missing, misplaced, or ambiguous; groupings are exhaustive and non-overlapping. Presentation is clear, structured (lists + table), and directly addresses the task without extraneous content.
