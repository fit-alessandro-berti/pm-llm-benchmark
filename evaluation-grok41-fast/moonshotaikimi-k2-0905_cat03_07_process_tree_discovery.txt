**2.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
- **Major structural flaw (catastrophic, -4.0 penalty)**: The XOR places the loop (`*(->('AE','RMI'), 'VF')`) as an alternative to the "straight path" (`->('AE', ->('AD', ->('SC','AC')))`). Exclusive choice (X) means selecting the loop branch precludes the straight path entirely. No trace from the loop reaches 'AD'/'SC'/'AC'—loop exit ends the XOR/process. All log traces (cases 1/3) enter "loop-like" behavior *then* reach 'AD'/'SC'/'AC'. Model cannot replay observed traces (fitness 0).
- **Incorrect loop semantics (-2.0 penalty)**: `* (A='->(AE,RMI)', B='VF')` executes A first (AERMI), then (exit *or* VFA again). Replays: RA VF AE RMI [end or VF AE RMI ... end]. Never produces log's post-loop AD/SC/AC, nor single post-loop VFAD (case 1). Reading claims "when exited, straight-forward path taken"—false; contradicts tree (XOR, not sequential).
- **Repeats non-repeating activity (-1.5 penalty)**: Loop repeats 'AE' (in A), but log has exactly one 'AE' per case (before any 'RMI'). Case 1/3: single AE  RMI(s)  VF  AD. Model forces extra AE(s) in loops—behavioral divergence (precision loss).
- **Fails multi-RMI without interleaving (-1.0 penalty)**: Case 3 has consecutive 'RMI RMI' post-AE pre-VF. Model's loop body is AERMI (single RMI per iteration), requiring AE between RMIs for multiples—infeasible without repeating AE (already wrong).
- **Unclear/misleading reading (-0.5 penalty)**: Claims loop iterates "AE RMI" then "re-validate VF after every iteration; when exited straight-forward path"—inaccurate vs. tree/log (no AE repeat, no post-exit straight path, "every iteration" mismatches single post-loop VF).
- **Partial credits (+1.0 total)**: Captures initial RAVF (+0.5); final ADSCAC in one branch (+0.3); loop intent with RMI/VF (+0.2). Notation syntactically valid.

**Overall**: Fundamentally non-functional model (0 fitness on key traces). Minor accuracies do not offset irreparable logic flaws. Not "nearly flawless"—award floor-proximal score per strict criteria.
