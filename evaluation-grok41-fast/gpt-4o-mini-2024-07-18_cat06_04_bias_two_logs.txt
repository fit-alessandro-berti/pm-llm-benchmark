**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting score above 5.0)**: Accurately identifies the core mechanism of bias via the +10 "Community Boost" in Group B's log (e.g., U001: 720730; U003: 695705), correctly notes absence in Group A, links to ScoreAdjustment column, and ties to CommunityGroup/LocalResident correlation. Discusses manifestation in decisions (e.g., approvals despite lower initial scores like U003) and systematic favoritism toward Group B. Structure is logical, comprehensive, and concludes with equity implications. Covers all required factors.
- **Major Flaws (preventing 9.0+)**:
  - **Fails to explicitly identify "which log exhibits bias"**: Question demands "Identify which log exhibits bias" upfront; answer circumvents with "comparison... reveals clear signs of bias" without stating "Group B's log exhibits bias via discriminatory adjustments." This is a direct, structural omission.
  - **Misses key evidence for systematic differences**: Does not compare specific scores/decisions showing bias impact (e.g., U003's 695705 *Approved* vs. P002's 710 *Rejected*; or U003's adjusted 705 approved despite below P002/U002's unadjusted 710 rejected). Claims "marginally higher scores" but U003 had *lower* initial score—logical gap weakens "how bias manifests in final decisions."
- **Significant Inaccuracies/Unclarities (docking to mid-7s)**:
  - Conflates LocalResident with causation: Boost is explicitly "Community Boost" for "Highland Civic Darts Club" (U002: LocalResident=TRUE, CommunityGroup=None, no boost, rejected like P002). Answer implies locals inherently favored ("fostering bias, favoring local applicants"), overstating correlation as direct cause.
  - Overgeneralizes: "Systematic boost given to *individuals in Group B*" implies all (but U002 got none); "Group B members might be penalized less harshly" ignores U002's identical treatment to Group A.
  - Vague on thresholds/rules: Mentions "likelihood of approved decision" but no inference on rules engine (e.g., why 705 approved but 710 rejected?), missing chance to pinpoint disparate treatment.
- **Minor Flaws (further deductions)**: "Both groups... approvals and rejections" notes parity (2/3 each) without emphasizing *mechanism* creates unequal opportunity (e.g., Group A can't access boost). Wordy redundancies (e.g., repeats +10 examples). No quantification of differences.
- **Why not lower?** No factual errors on logs; main thesis (bias favors Group B via adjustments absent in A) is sound. Why not higher? Not "nearly flawless"—multiple logical gaps/omissions under strict scrutiny justify ~25% deduction from 10.0.
