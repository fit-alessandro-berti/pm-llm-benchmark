**4.2**

### Strict Evaluation Breakdown
- **Format Compliance (2/3 points)**: The core output is a valid Python dictionary with correct key-value structure (tuples of 2-char activity strings  tuples of two positive integers in seconds). However, it is wrapped in unnecessary prose ("## Temporal Profile...", intro text, explanation, usage example with extra function), violating the task's directive to "Produce a Python dictionary". Comments within the dict are explanatory fluff not requested, reducing purity.
- **Coverage & Complexity (2/2 points)**: Includes a representative subset (~17 pairs) with both direct (e.g., 'RC','QI') and multi-step (e.g., 'SS','RC', 'OP','CA') pairs across all 10 activities. Ensures logical precedence (SS earliest, AS latest).
- **Realism of Estimates (1/2 points)**: Times are plausible individually for supply chain (seconds correctly convert: 604800=7 days, etc.; procurement weeks, inspections days). Std devs ~10% of means, reasonable. Comments aid interpretability.
- **Logical Consistency & Accuracy (-3 major deductions)**:
  - **Fatal additive inconsistencies**: In a sequential process (SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS), avg(AC) must  avg(AB) + avg(BC) for ABC. Examples:
    |OPRC| + |RCCA| = 7d + 30d = 37d, but |OPCA| = 21d (**impossible**, shorter than subspans).
    |RCQI| + |QICA| = 1d + 2d = 3d, but |RCCA| = 30d (**impossible**).
    |CAPT| + |PTPK| = 1d + 2d = 3d, but |CAPK| = 7d (mismatch, though less severe).
    |SSOP| + |OPRC| = 14d matches |SSRC|, but chain breaks elsewhere.
  - Comment errors: |RCCA| called "6 weeks" (actually ~4.3 weeks/30d).
  - No evidence of path variability justifying contradictions; assumes linear traces per scenario.
- **Clarity & Completeness (1/1 point)**: Readable, self-contained estimates "based on general knowledge".
- **Extraneous Content (-0.8)**: Explanation repeats dict; unrequested `check_deviation` function adds ~20 lines, dilutes focus.

**Total: 4.2/10**. Strong structure/effort, but core logical flaws make the profile unusable for deviation detection (e.g., ZETA bounds incoherent). Minor issues compound (extras, comment inaccuracy). Not "nearly flawless"—requires full consistency rewrite for >9.
