**2.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Major Semantic Inaccuracies in Loops (fatal, -4.0)**: 
  - `iqc_as_loop = LOOP(IQC, AS)` semantics: IQC (+AS IQC)* (always starts with IQC, ends with IQC if looped). Cannot produce observed traces like IQC AS (cases 1,2: ends with AS, no trailing IQC), IQC IQC (case 3: consecutive IQCs impossible, as post-IQC is AS IQC or exit). Case 4 (no IQC) impossible, as AS  iqc_as_loop forces IQC. Does not "match IQC appearing repeatedly before a final AS" as claimed—opposite.
  - `tst_rt_loop` works superficially but positioned after forced IQC loop, breaking case 4.
- **Critical Errors in Choice/Optional Paths (-2.5)**: LB undefined/missing (no `LB = Transition("LB")`). `lb_choice = XOR(skip, PK)` wrongly includes PK in choice: allows skipping PK (impossible—all cases have PK), no LB ever executed, contradicts summary ("LB optional after PK"). PK not always enforced before DP.
- **Ordering/Dependency Flaws (-1.0)**: AS  iqc_as_loop  tst_rt_loop forces IQC before every TST (blocks case 4). No concurrency captured (all serial despite claim). Redundant ORQS/AS edges minor but illogical.
- **Unclarities/Inconsistencies (-0.5)**: Code vs. summary mismatch (e.g., "doing LB after PK" but no LB/PK-after). PK defined but misplaced. Nodes list excludes PK/LB properly.
- **Failure to Generalize Log (-0.5)**: Cannot replay any full trace exactly (e.g., case 1 impossible sans trailing IQC; case 4 skips IQC/PK?). Overclaims "generalizes the given event log."
- **Minor Positives (+1.0)**: Identifies testing loop correctly; partial order structure conceptually sound; uses POWL elements appropriately.

Nearly unusable model—fundamentally misrepresents process. Requires full rewrite.
