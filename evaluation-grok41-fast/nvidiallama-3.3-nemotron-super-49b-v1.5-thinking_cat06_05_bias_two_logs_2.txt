**9.8**

The final answer is exceptionally strong: it precisely identifies **Group B** as exhibiting bias, with accurate examples from the logs (e.g., U001: 6065; U003: 5863), clear manifestation via the +5 adjustment absent in Group A, and robust implications tied directly to fairness/equity (discrimination, merit erosion, legal risks). Structure enhances clarity, logic is airtight, and it avoids overreach by grounding claims in evidence without unsubstantiated assumptions (e.g., no invented cutoffs). Minor deduction for a single typographical flaw ("60  65" instead of "60 to 65"), which introduces negligible unclarity under hypercritical scrutiny, and for unasked-for recommendations (though they align perfectly and add value without flaw). Otherwise flawless.
