**8.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (why not lower)**:
  - **Core logic is flawless**: Correctly uses `LEAD(..., 1)` and `LEAD(..., 2)` over `PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp` to detect *exact consecutive succession* (no intervening events). Filters precisely on the Approve row for the sequence check. Computes *correct* time delta as `(confirm_ts - create_ts)` (> `INTERVAL '5' DAY`), which is the elapsed time between *Create Order* and *Confirm Order* in that specific triple. Uses `DISTINCT case_id` properly (excludes entire case if *any* matching sequence exists). `NOT IN` correctly excludes *all events* from matching cases, returning others as required.
  - **DuckDB syntax compliance**: Window functions, `INTERVAL`, timestamp subtraction (yields comparable INTERVAL), subquery structure all valid. Handles edge cases implicitly (e.g., NULL LEADS filtered by activity checks; multiple sequences per case handled by DISTINCT).
  - **Efficiency and completeness**: Computes over full `event_log` (no unnecessary filtering beforehand); returns all columns/events (`*`) from non-excluded cases. No extraneous ordering/grouping (prompt doesn't require it).
  - **Explanation clarity**: Concise, accurate description of approach/code, aligning with prompt.

- **Fatal Flaw (significant deduction)**:
  - **Syntax error breaks execution**: The inner subquery `SELECT` *omits `activity`* (current row's activity), but the `WHERE` filters on `activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'`. This causes a runtime error ("column 'activity' does not exist" in `seq`). Query fails entirely, failing the benchmark's "write a [working] DuckDB SQL query" requirement. This is not a logical flaw but a critical implementation inaccuracy—obvious from code inspection.
  - Penalty: -2.0 (strictly enforced; "any inaccuracies" must "significantly lower"; non-executable = not "nearly flawless").

- **Minor issues (no further deduction, as hyper-minor)**:
  - No explicit handling for timestamp ties (e.g., `ORDER BY timestamp, some_row_id` for stability), but prompt assumes standard ordering; not required.
  - Explanation says "for each event, verify...", which is precise but could note it's per-Approve row.

Overall: 10.0 logic/approach, but syntax failure prevents perfection. 8.0 reflects "very good but not flawless" under strict criteria (e.g., ~80-90th percentile benchmark solution). Fix: Add `activity,` after `case_id,` in inner `SELECT`.
