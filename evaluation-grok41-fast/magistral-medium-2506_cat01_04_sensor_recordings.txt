**10.0**

The answer flawlessly meets all task requirements: it systematically groups all 15 events into distinct, non-overlapping phases (Idle: 1-3,13-15; Cutting Metal: 4-6; Assembling Parts: 7-8; Welding: 9; Quality Inspection: 10; Packaging: 11-12) based on clear patterns in sensor data (e.g., high vibration/temperature/flow for cutting; extreme temperature/energy/no flow for welding). Rationales are precise, intuitive, and tied directly to sensor changes (e.g., vibration 30-38 Hz and tool movement for cutting; cooling to 30°C/low activity post-weld for inspection). Labels align perfectly with prompt examples. Output includes labeled activities, explanations, and a concise summary table for clarity. The sequence forms a coherent manufacturing process (Idle  Cut  Assemble  Weld  Inspect  Package  Idle) with no gaps, inventions, or ambiguities. Domain caveat adds nuance without undermining conclusions. No inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities.
