**4.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Major semantic inaccuracies (fatal flaws, -4+ points)**: The assembly phase model is fundamentally broken and fails to trace most cases (1,2,3,5). LOOP(IQC, X(AS, skip1)) forces execution to *always end after IQC* (since exits occur only post-A, not post-B), but all traces end assembly *after AS* before TST (e.g., Case 1: `AS IQC AS TST` has no trailing IQC). No path produces `AS IQC AS` without an extra IQC. Consecutive IQCs (Case 3) require silent skips, but still can't exit post-AS. Case 4 works coincidentally (skip2), but that's 1/5 cases. Claim "All cases... can be traced" is **false** and overconfident.
- **Logical flaws in modeling (-2 points)**: LOOP semantics misunderstood for assembly (can't exit post-B=AS). Analysis text misdescribes: "do IQC followed by either AS... or skip" implies exit options mismatched to operator. Testing/packaging correct (LOOP(TST,RT) perfectly ends post-TST; optional LB good), but one good subpart doesn't salvage core failure.
- **Minor code/structural issues (-0.5 points)**: Valid POWL syntax (Transitions, SilentTransition, OperatorPOWL(XOR/LOOP), StrictPartialOrder with edges). Sequential chaining via root PO correct (no unneeded concurrency). Skips well-used. But assembly_continuation PO([AS, X(loop, skip2)], AS...) adds unnecessary PO wrapper (could be sequential OperatorPOWL, but minor).
- **Unclarities/incompletenesses (-0.5 points)**: Comment "# for skipping AS in assembly loop" accurate but irrelevant since loop unusable. No handling of multiple consecutive IQCs without trailing AS violation. No concurrency modeled (fine, traces sequential), but prompt emphasizes PO for it—unused opportunity minor.
- **Strengths (partial credit +1.0)**: Correctly IDs patterns (start seq, testing loop, optional LB). Code executable/syntactic. Covers all activities. Good effort on complexity.

Nearly flawless would require *exact* traceability for all 5 cases with minimal operators/silents, no false claims, precise comments. This is ~20% accurate (1/5 cases + peripherals), hence 4.0.
