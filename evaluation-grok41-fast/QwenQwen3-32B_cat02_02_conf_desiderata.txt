**4.0**

### Explanation of Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (why not lower):** Well-structured response matching the task's 3 parts exactly. Correctly identifies Case 2's ordering violation (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) and finalize-after-rejection violation. Accurately states Case 1 and Case 3 have no normative violations (sequence intact where present). Good use of table for summary. Interpretations are plausible and on-topic. Case 3 desiderata mostly correct in concept (delays and missing follow-up).
- **Major Flaws (significant penalties):**
  - **Missed critical normative violation in Case 2:** Completely overlooks the **skipping of "Inform Applicant"**, a mandatory step ("must be informed of the outcome") after Loan Decision and before any branching/closing. Log clearly lacks it (no row between 09:30 Decision and 10:00 Finalize). This is a direct sequence skip, equivalent in severity to the noted violations. Counts as at least 3 normative violations for Case 2, not 2—fundamental logical flaw.
  - **Factual errors in time calculations for Case 3:**
    - Credit Check: 2024-01-12 09:00 to 2024-01-14 10:00 = **49 hours** (not 42). Miscalculation undermines precision.
    - Inform Applicant: 2024-01-14 12:00 to 2024-01-16 15:00 = **51 hours** (not 49). Another error.
  - **Inconsistency/unjustified claim on desiderata for Case 1:** States "no missing follow-up call" despite **no log entry** for it (like Cases 2/3). Log explicitly notes absence only for Case 3, but absence of evidence  evidence of presence. Cannot "fully adhere" without basis; all cases arguably fail this desideratum. Overclaims perfection.
  - **Minor but penalized issues:** Desiderata for Case 2 ignores potential timing issues due to normative chaos but lists only follow-up (ok, but incomplete). No mention if Case 2's Credit Check timing qualifies desiderata (1 hour post-app: fine, but unaddressed). Interpretations speculative but not "in line with constraints" strictly (e.g., "system misconfiguration" doesn't justify violations).
- **Overall:** Not "nearly flawless"—core analysis incomplete (missed skip), factually inaccurate (times), and logically flawed (Case 1 follow-up). Structure saves it from <4.0, but strictness demands heavy deduction for these. A flawless answer would catch the skip, compute times exactly, and consistently apply follow-up absence across all cases.
