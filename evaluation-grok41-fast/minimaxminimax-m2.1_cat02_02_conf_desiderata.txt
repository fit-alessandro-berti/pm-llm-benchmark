**7.2**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: Excellent structure mirroring the task (clear sections for normative violations, desiderata, interpretations/justifications). Precise identification of Case 1 as fully normative-compliant. Correct flagging of Case 2's two explicit violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection) with strong explanations tying to process integrity and implications. Case 3 correctly deemed normatively compliant. Desiderata analysis directionally accurate for timings (exceeds thresholds) and clarifies non-severe/suboptimal nature. Good suggestions for interpretations (e.g., systemic issues, resource constraints). Comprehensive, professional tone; executive summary and recommendations add value without straying.
  
- **Major Flaws (significant deductions)**:
  - **Critical omission in normative analysis for Case 2**: Completely fails to identify the missing "Inform Applicant" activity, which is a **mandatory step** ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed"; "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision"; "no skipping activities"). Log has Loan Decision  Finalize Documentation  Close Case, skipping Inform entirely—a clear normative violation (skipping required sequence step). This is not mentioned anywhere, rendering Case 2 analysis incomplete and understating violations. Hypercritical penalty: -1.5.
  - **Factual errors in desiderata timings for Case 3**:
    | Activity | Actual Duration | Answer's Claim | Error |
    |----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
    | Credit Check (Jan-12 09:00  Jan-14 10:00) | ~49 hours | "approximately 98 hours" | ~2x overstated |
    | Inform Applicant (Jan-14 12:00  Jan-16 15:00) | ~51 hours | "approximately 75 hours" | ~50% overstated |
    Inaccurate calculations undermine credibility; even if direction (>24h/>48h) holds, precise claims are sloppy/wrong. Penalty: -0.8.
  - **Inconsistency in desiderata for Case 1**: Claims "Fully Meets Desiderata" but immediately notes no Follow-up Call as "minor deviation." Contradicts self—"fully" implies no fails, yet log shows absence (desiderata: "encouraged... skipping is not serious"). Fails to explicitly "identify" Case 1 as failing desiderata (per task 2), unlike Case 3. Penalty: -0.3.
  - **Minor unclarities/logical gaps**: Case 2 desiderata "omitted due to normative violations"—logical but sidesteps task to "identify which cases fail" (no Inform means auto-fail on prompt inform; timings could still be assessed). No explicit desiderata fail identification for Follow-up in Case 1/3 as shared issue. Penalty: -0.2.

- **Overall**: Near-flawless structure/content (8.5+ base), but key omission + factual errors prevent "nearly flawless" (must be 9.5+ for 9-10). Strict deductions total ~2.8 points off perfect 10.0. No criminal/off-policy issues.
