This response is exemplary and fully complies with the prompt. It delivers exactly 20 distinct, thought-provoking, open-ended questions (all phrased as "How", "What", or "Which" to invite analysis and discussion). Every question directly derives from and engages key elements of the described process—suppliers/countries (accurately referenced, e.g., Q2), assembly/logistics (Malaysia, air/sea, DCs), quality/recalls, digital systems/analytics/ML (Q3, Q11, Q13), regulations/compliance, risks (geopolitical, currency), improvements (sustainability, resilience, contracts), and implications (forecasting, metrics, reverse logistics). No SQL queries, no extraneous text—just a clean numbered list. No inaccuracies (facts align precisely, e.g., supplier nations), unclarities (precise, professional phrasing), or logical flaws (each targets insights/issues/strategies/implications without assumptions or gaps). Coverage is comprehensive yet focused, spanning the full end-to-end chain without repetition. Utterly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny.
