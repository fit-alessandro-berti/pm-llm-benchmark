**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (why not lower)**:
  - Correct format: Valid Python dictionary with tuple keys `(earlier_activity, later_activity)` and tuple values `(avg_time_seconds, stdev_seconds)` as integers, matching the example.
  - Logical structure: Assumes correct linear order (SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS), includes direct, skipped-one, multi-step, and long-range pairs, fulfilling "representative subset" with complexity (38/45 possible pairs, ~84% coverage).
  - Reasonable domain knowledge: Times escalate logically (early procurement long/variable, mid manufacturing tight, late distribution variable); seconds-based with helpful day/hour comments.
  - Additive approximation mostly holds: Many pairs sum correctly (e.g., SS-QI = SS-OP + OP-RC + RC-QI = 4+15+1=20 days; RC-PT=1+2+1=4 days).
  - Stdev propagation approximate (e.g., compounding via ~(sum variances) for some); extra explanation adds value without being asked.
  - No criminal/off-policy issues; adult content N/A.

- **Inaccuracies/Logical Flaws (major deductions; not nearly flawless)**:
  - **Internal inconsistencies in averages (critical flaw, -1.5 points)**: Several long-range avgs fail additivity, off by *exactly* 1 day (86400s), indicating arithmetic/copy-paste errors, not defensible "estimation":
    | Pair      | Listed Avg (days) | Expected Sum (days) | Error |
    |-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
    | ('SS','DT') | 29.67            | 28.67              | +1   |
    | ('SS','AS') | 59.67            | 58.67              | +1   |
    | ('OP','AS') | 55.67            | 54.67              | +1   |
    | ('RC','AS') | 40.67            | 39.67              | +1   |
    | ('QI','AS') | 39.67            | 38.67              | +1   |
    This breaks the model's core (avg time between pairs should accumulate additively in linear traces). 5/38 entries (~13%) flawed = sloppy, not rigorous.
  - **Stdev underestimation (minor flaw, -0.5 points)**: Long-range stdev too low vs. chain length (e.g., SS-DT stdev 4.67d despite 7+ steps with individual stdevs summing variances to >>4.67d; ignores compounding uncertainty).
  - **Incomplete coverage (minor flaw, -0.3 points)**: "Representative subset" ok, but omits some multi-step pairs (e.g., ('SS','PK'), ('SS','WS'), ('OP','PK'), ('RC','WS')) without reason; claims "complexity" but arbitrary gaps.
  - **Unclarities (minor flaw, -0.3 points)**: Comments use approx decimals (e.g., "5.17 days") that don't always match exact calcs; no justification for why some stdevs equal avg (e.g., SS-OP, OP-RC? Unrealistic for supply chain).
  - **Overreach (minor flaw, -0.2 points)**: Adds unrequested header, categories, and 5-point explanation—helpful but bloats beyond "Produce a Python dictionary".

- **Scoring Math**: Start at 10. Deduct 1.5 (inconsistencies) +0.5 (stdev) +0.3 (coverage) +0.3 (unclarity) +0.2 (overreach) = 7.5 base, -0.3 holistically for not being "nearly flawless" (errors undermine trust in all estimates). **Final: 7.2**. Good effort, but flaws prevent >8.
