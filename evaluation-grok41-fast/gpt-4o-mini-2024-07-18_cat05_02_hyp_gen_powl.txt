7.2

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (supporting ~8-9 range baseline):**
- **Anomalies Identification (flawless, 10/10):** Precisely captures the loop (E-P repetition), XOR skip (N optional), and partial order issues (no xorC enforcement; direct AC enabling premature C). Matches code exactly (e.g., `Operator.LOOP(children=[E, P])`, `Operator.XOR(children=[N, skip])`, missing xorC edge, explicit AC). Clear, concise, no extras or misses.
- **Hypotheses (strong, 9/10):** Covers all suggested scenarios (business rule changes, miscommunication, technical errors, inadequate constraints) with relevant expansions (e.g., backlogs for loop, team misalignment for XOR). Logical and context-specific; minor deduct for slightly generic phrasing but no flaws.
- **Structure/Completeness (excellent):** Mirrors task exactly; comprehensive coverage; professional tone.

**Fatal Flaws (significant deductions, pulling to 7.2):**
- **Verification Queries – Major Logical/SQL Error in Query 3 (deduct -2.0):** Core flaw. Query for "skipped N" is **fundamentally broken**:
  ```sql
  SELECT claim_id, COUNT(event_id) AS num_notified
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'N'  -- Only rows WITH 'N' pass filter
  GROUP BY claim_id
  HAVING num_notified = 0;  -- Impossible: COUNT >=1 for grouped rows; returns 0 rows always
  ```
  Cannot detect *any* skips. Ignores basic SQL logic (use NOT EXISTS, LEFT JOIN, or start from claims with 'C'). Even intent flawed: no filter for "completed" claims (e.g., those with 'C' or 'P'); flags unfinished claims falsely. Undermines XOR anomaly verification. Hypercritical: unacceptable for "verify... in the event data."
- **Query 1 Minor Issues (deduct -0.3):** Works correctly (claims with 'C' but no E/P anywhere), but `HAVING num_events > 0` redundant (WHERE ensures >=1 'C'); `COUNT(event_id)` irrelevant (just list `claim_id`).
- **Query 4 Minor Unclarity (deduct -0.2):** Good for out-of-order (max P > max C), but selects unused `assigned`; comment "approvals after closing" precise but doesn't tie explicitly to AC (e.g., no AC timestamp check like C after A but before E).
- **Query 2 Solid (no deduct):** Perfect for loop (multiple P).
- **Overall Verification Gaps (deduct -0.3):** No query for loop-specific patterns (e.g., EPE sequences via timestamps); no join to `claims`/`adjusters` (e.g., specialization mismatch for anomalies); misses % frequency (e.g., "frequently skipped" needs COUNT(*) / total completed).

**Net: 10 - 2.8 = 7.2.** Nearly strong (solid insights if Query 3 fixed), but SQL bug + minors = not "nearly flawless." Unintuitive/experimental POWL details handled well, but verification (task's analytical core) compromised.
