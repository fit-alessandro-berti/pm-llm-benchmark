**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Assessment)
This answer is solid in structure, directly addressing all three task parts with clear headings, and correctly identifies Case 2 as the sole normative violator and Case 3 for desiderata issues. It provides explanations, clarifications of severity, and reasonable justifications/interpretations. The summary is concise and accurate. However, under utmost strictness, several issues prevent a higher score:

- **Major omission (logical flaw, incompleteness):** Fails to identify the missing **Inform Applicant** activity in Case 2, despite it being a required step ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; sequence explicitly includes it; "no skipping"). This is a clear normative violation equivalent in severity to the listed ones, yet completely ignored. Case 2 has *at least* three violations (order reversal, post-rejection finalization, skipped notification), not two.
- **Factual inaccuracy:** In Case 2 Violation 1, incorrectly states Credit Check timestamp as "2024-01-11 08:20" (actual log: 09:00). This misquotes the event log, introduces confusion (implies simultaneity with Risk Assessment at 08:20, undermining the "before" claim), and exemplifies sloppy verification.
- **Minor unclarities/incompletenesses:** Does not explicitly state that Case 1 and Case 3 have *no* normative violations (implied but not identified per task: "Identify which cases are violating"), potentially leaving room for ambiguity. Desiderata section notes no Follow-up Call only for Case 3 (per log notation), but doesn't consider if applicable to others (minor, as log doesn't flag). Justifications are generic ("possible error," "delays") but "in line" with task; no deeper alignment attempts.
- **No logical flaws in covered content,** but coverage is not exhaustive or flawless.

These (especially omission and inaccuracy) are not "nearly flawless," warranting deduction from 10.0 (~3 points off for misses, ~0.5-1 for inaccuracy/minors). A 7.0 reflects competent but critically flawed execution.
