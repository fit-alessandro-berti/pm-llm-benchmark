9.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: The response directly produces a **list of targeted, open-ended questions** ("How...", "What...", "Can you...") perfectly aligned with the prompt's goals: uncovering missing details (e.g., document standards, inspector issues), decision criteria (e.g., workload metrics, tenant scoring), roles/responsibilities (e.g., who schedules visits, IT verification), timing/sequencing (e.g., inspection timeframe), and exceptions (e.g., special insurance, custom clauses). No SQL or implementation details requested— all conceptual. Comprehensive coverage of the process stages (documentation to audits, plus communication). Logical grouping into 8 categories enhances clarity without fluff overload. ~21 questions show depth without redundancy. No factual inaccuracies relative to the process description.
  
- **Minor Flaws Deducting 0.8 Points (Strict Penalties)**:
  1. **Extra non-essential text (0.3 deduction)**: "Certainly! Here are some..." intro and closing sentence ("These questions should help...") add polite framing but deviate from "produce a list"—pure list would be flawless. Minor bloat under hypercriticism.
  2. **Incomplete timing/sequencing coverage (0.3 deduction)**: Only *one* question probes timing (inspection resolution timeframe). Prompt explicitly calls to "verify timing and sequencing," but no questions on overall process duration, dependencies between steps (e.g., database entry before assignment?), or sequencing variations (e.g., marketing before/after activation?). Process emphasizes "multiple decision points" and "back and forth"—gap in probing full flow.
  3. **Light coverage on select process elements (0.2 deduction)**: Minimal on property details entry (e.g., how square footage/amenities verified?), marketing specifics (e.g., pricing model updates, brochure creation), or post-selection steps (e.g., security deposit collection, move-in logistics). Exceptions/quality checks strong, but not exhaustive (e.g., no multi-city regional/central coordination).
  
- **Why Not Lower (e.g., <9.0)**: Flaws are truly minor—coverage is 90%+ of process, questions are precise/logical/no overlaps, and structure (bold headers, bullets) improves usability. No unclarities, logical errors, or off-prompt elements.
- **Why Not 10.0**: Not "nearly flawless"—timing gap and extras prevent perfection under "even minor issues significantly lower." A 10 would be raw numbered/bulleted list only, with 1-2 more sequencing/timing questions.
