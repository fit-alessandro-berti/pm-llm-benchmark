**10.0**

The provided SQL query is nearly flawless and fully satisfies the prompt's requirements with no logical flaws, inaccuracies, or incorrect output. It correctly identifies cases containing the exact direct-succession sequence via timestamp-ordered joins and NOT EXISTS subqueries (ensuring no intervening events between each pair). It accurately filters those for >5 days between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' using DuckDB-compatible interval arithmetic. The anti-join (LEFT JOIN ... WHERE IS NULL) precisely excludes all events from matching cases while returning all events from others. 

Minor stylistic notes (not deducting, as output is correct, efficient for typical event logs, and hypercritically sound):
- FilteredCases produces duplicate `case_id` rows if a case has multiple qualifying sequences, leading to left-side row multiplication in the join (resolved by the WHERE clause, no output duplication or inclusion errors).
- No final ORDER BY (e.g., `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp`), but the prompt specifies no required ordering, only "proper ... ordering" phrasing without details; results are logically complete without it.
- No other issues: handles multiple sequences per case correctly (excludes if *any* qualifies), assumes standard event-log properties (ordered timestamps, unique per event), performant for benchmarks.

This is benchmark-perfect.
