**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (why not lower):** 
  - Excellent structure mirroring the task (Part 1/2 separation, clear case-by-case breakdown, explanations tied to rules/logs, interpretations provided as requested, summary table for clarity, even extra recommendations).
  - Correctly identifies **Case 1** as fully normative-compliant (perfect sequence/timings).
  - Correctly identifies **Case 3** as normative-compliant, with precise desiderata violations (delays calculated accurately: ~49h for credit check, ~51h for inform; missing follow-up noted).
  - For **Case 2** normative: Correctly spots *two* violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection), with accurate log references and rule citations.
  - Desiderata handling generally good: Clarifies "suboptimal/not severe"; Case 3 spot-on; Case 1 reasonable (timings fine, follow-up not explicitly flagged in log).
  - Interpretations/justifications thoughtful and aligned (e.g., bugs, workload for delays).
  - Final summary table concise/accurate *except* noted flaws; conclusions clear.

- **Critical Flaws (penalizing to 7.2, not higher):**
  - **Major inaccuracy in Case 2 normative violations (primary deduction -1.5 pts):** Completely misses the *mandatory skip of "Inform Applicant"*, a strict normative rule ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; sequence requires it after Decision, before branch/close). Log shows Decision (Rejected) at 09:30  Finalize 10:00  Close 10:30, *no Inform at all*. This is a clear "skipping activities" violation parallel to the others identified. Lists only 2 violations instead of 3; explanations incomplete. Not "nearly flawless."
  - **Minor unclarity/logical flaw in Case 2 desiderata (-0.3 pts):** Table marks as "(Not relevant due to normative violations)" – but task requires *identifying* desiderata failures *separately*, regardless. Mentions missing follow-up but subordinates it; inconsistent with Case 3 treatment.
  - **Minor inconsistency in desiderata follow-up across cases (-0.3 pts):** Case 1 deemed "no violations" without addressing unlogged follow-up (encouraged pre-close); Case 3 explicitly penalized for it. Log flags only Case 3, but answer's selective application lacks precision (could clarify "assumed compliant if unnoted").
  - **Minor overreach (-0.2 pts):** Case 2 interpretations speculative ("human operator may have mistakenly performed Risk Assessment") but fine; however, recommendations go beyond task (not penalized heavily as additive value).
  - No other issues (e.g., timings precise, no factual errors in identified points, no logical reversals).

- **Why not 10/9.x?** Not "nearly flawless" – missing a *clear, explicit normative skip* (comparable to "Finalize after reject") is a significant inaccuracy, warranting ~25-30% deduction from perfect (107.2). Hyperstrict per instructions: one major + minors = significantly lower.
- **Why not <7?** 80%+ coverage of violations/content; structure/insights elevate above mediocre.
