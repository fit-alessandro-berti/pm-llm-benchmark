The answer correctly identifies all violating cases (2, 3, 5) and compliant cases (1, 4), with no errors in case classification. Explanations accurately reference the normative description's key constraints (e.g., order of Authorize/Package/Ship, no Ship after Cancel), interpret branching logic soundly, and use clear structure (sections, table) for readability. The summary table concisely captures core violations.

Minor deductions for:
- Imprecise phrasing in Case 5 violation header and table ("Ship order occurs before Package items" / "Shipping before packaging"), which is factually inaccurate since "Package items" is absent (not occurring after); the explanation correctly notes the skip, mitigating but not eliminating the flaw.
- Incomplete coverage in Case 3: Misses secondary violations like "Cancel order" not directly after "Check inventory" (normative "directly proceed") and intervening "Authorize payment" (contradicting sufficient-inventory path assumption), focusing only on Ship after Cancel (valid but partial).

These are small issues in an otherwise precise, comprehensive response; no major logical flaws or unclarities.
