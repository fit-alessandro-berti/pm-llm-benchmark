**9.5**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This is an excellent query that correctly implements the requirements with clear CTE-based logic, precise consecutive event detection via `ROW_NUMBER()`, accurate interval filtering, and proper case exclusion. It handles the core logic flawlessly: direct succession (via `event_num` offsets), time condition (>5 days on specific pair in the triple), at least-one matching sequence per case triggers exclusion, and final output is all events from non-matching cases. DuckDB syntax is correct (e.g., `INTERVAL '5 days'`, window functions).

**Strengths (why not lower):**
- Perfect sequence detection: Joins ensure *exact* consecutive events (`event_num - 1`), no gaps.
- Correct timing: Only `create` to `confirm` in the identified triple, >5 days.
- Exclusion logic: Case-level (not event-level), via `NOT IN`; handles multiple sequences per case correctly (excludes if 1 bad triple).
- Efficient structure: CTEs are modular, readable; no unnecessary computation.
- Explanation: Precise, step-by-step, matches query.
- Edge cases implicitly handled: Assumes timestamp-ordered log (standard); multiples/duplicates fine.

**Deductions (strict/minor issues, each costing ~0.1-0.3):**
- **No final `ORDER BY`** (-0.3): Prompt explicitly requires "proper ... ordering". Result is unordered `SELECT *`, risking arbitrary order (e.g., not by `case_id, timestamp`). Should add `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` to mimic log order and ensure reproducibility. Significant for "proper ordering".
- **No `DISTINCT` in `excluded_cases`** (-0.1): Harmless ( `NOT IN` dedups), but hyper-picky: multiples from repeated sequences bloat subquery unnecessarily; `SELECT DISTINCT case_id` is cleaner/optimally efficient.
- **Unspecified tie-handling in `ROW_NUMBER()`** (-0.1): If timestamps tie (possible, though rare), order is implementation-defined (not stable). Minor logical gap; should use `ORDER BY timestamp, activity` or note assumption of unique timestamps.
- **Extra advice slightly hedging** (-0.1): "Adjust interval syntax if necessary" implies doubt, but it's correct for DuckDB; unnecessary/unconfident for flawless answer.

Nearly perfect (flawless logic/accuracy/clarity); only ultra-minor polish issues prevent 10.0. Retest-ready with tiny tweaks.
