The provided answer is correct, efficient, and precisely addresses the requirements without any inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. The CTE accurately computes event counts per `case_id`, the JOIN correctly retrieves full event rows only for qualifying cases, and the `WHERE` clause enforces the exact filter (`<= 6`). It handles the "at least" columns appropriately by selecting `e.*`, works in DuckDB, and the explanation is concise, accurate, and mirrors the logic step-by-step. No inefficiencies, edge cases mishandled, or extraneous elements.
