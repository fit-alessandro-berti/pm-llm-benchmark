**Grade: 1.5**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Invalid Python Code (Fatal Flaw, -4.0):** The provided `declare_model` is **not valid Python**. Dictionaries cannot have duplicate keys (e.g., multiple `"StartApplication"` entries in `"coexistence"` and `"response"`). The last entry overwrites priors, rendering added constraints non-functional or lost. This directly violates "Preserve the Format" and "valid Python code." No excuse—basic syntax error in core output.
- **Mismatch Between Code and Explanation (Major Inaccuracy, -2.0):** Explanation claims additions like `{"Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": ...}}` or ties to `FinalDecision`, but **NONE exist in code**. Mentions "Coexistence of ManualReview with FinalDecision" but code uses `StartApplication`. Fabricated rationale for non-existent constraints.
- **Fails Bias Mitigation Logic (Core Task Failure, -1.5):** Constraints apply universally (e.g., coexistence/response/succession from `StartApplication` forces `ManualReview`/`BiasMitigationCheck` in **every** trace, not "sensitive demographics" or "events where a sensitive attribute leads to a biased outcome"). Ignores prompt examples (e.g., no `CheckApplicantRace  Reject` prevention via `non-succession`; no `BiasMitigationCheck` between sensitive events and decisions). `existence` mandates bias checks always, bloating model irrelevantly.
- **Unclear/Irrelevant Additions (Logical Flaws, -0.5):** `ManualReview`/`BiasMitigationCheck` introduced without model integration (e.g., no sensitive-activity links). `coexistence` with `StartApplication` (symmetric existence) doesn't "prevent immediate biased decisions"—it just forces extras blindly.
- **Incomplete Documentation (-0.3):** Explanation not "brief rationale for **each added constraint**" (prompt)—lists 3 but code has ~5 flawed ones; vague/overstated "Overall Impact" ignores flaws.
- **Minor Issues (-0.2):** No use of negative constraints (`noncoexistence`, `nonsuccession`) despite prompt emphasis; assumes `FinalDecision` = `Reject` without basis.

Total deductions exceed perfection; minimal effort/understanding shown (preserves original but breaks it). Barely above 1.0 for attempting structure.
