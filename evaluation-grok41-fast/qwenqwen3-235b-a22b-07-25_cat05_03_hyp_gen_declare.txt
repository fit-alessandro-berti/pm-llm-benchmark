**9.4**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies (9.8/10):** Nearly flawless. Correctly identifies core contradiction between `existence(C)` + `noncoexistence(E,C)` (forcing no E ever, vs. intended flow), backwards `responded_existence(E  A)` (ignores order), insufficient sequencing/missing existences for A/E/P. Minor phrasing ambiguity in first bullet ("`noncoexistence` ... forbids E and C ... [leading to] C without E" implies the rule blocks C solo, when it permits it—logical flow intact but wording imprecise). Comprehensive coverage of undesired paths.
- **Hypotheses (10.0/10):** Flawless. Directly aligns with prompt examples (misinterpretation, policy changes, data issues, pressure); adds strong, plausible extras (ambiguity, semantics). Varied, insightful, non-repetitive.
- **Verification Approaches (9.0/10):** Excellent coverage of prompt examples (closed w/o eval: Q1; E+C coexist: Q2; eval w/ assign: Q3+Q5). Extras (Q4 P-missing, Q5 resource validity, Q6 timings) enhance relevance. All PostgreSQL-valid, use correct tables/columns/logic (timestamps for order, EXISTS/NOT EXISTS proper). **Deductions:** Q2/Q5 lack `DISTINCT`/`GROUP BY`, yielding duplicate claim_ids (violates "find claims" intent, outputs messy lists—significant for data queries). No query for `init(R)` violations (e.g., non-R starts) or `precedence(RC)` reversals, undercovering model rules. Q6 assumes single-stage timestamps via MAX (risky if multiples, though pragmatic).
- **Overall Structure/Independence (10.0/10):** Perfect adherence—no hints leaked, self-contained, clear headings, concise yet thorough. No verbosity/ repetition penalized per instructions.
- **Total:** 9.4 (minor SQL output flaws + phrasing nit + slight rule coverage gap prevent 10; hypercritically, these are "significantly" penalizable but corrected by excellence elsewhere).
