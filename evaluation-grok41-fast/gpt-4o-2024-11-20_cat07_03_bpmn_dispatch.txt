**9.8/10.0**

### Rationale:
- **Strengths (exceptional accuracy and completeness)**:
  - Correctly identifies **swimlanes** (Logistics and Warehouse) and assigns tasks accurately to each (e.g., Logistics handles decisions/quotes/insurance/labeling; Warehouse handles packaging/prep).
  - **Process flow** is nearly perfectly traced: Start ("Ship Goods")  Clarify/review shipment method  Special handling decision (3 offers/select/order)  Insurance check  Label  Packaging (48h max + notify delay)  Prep (paperwork/pickup)  End ("Parcel ready"). Merges and branches are implied correctly.
  - **Symbols** section is spot-on: ovals (start/end), diamonds (decisions like special handling/insurance), rectangles (tasks), database ("Customer information"), clock (48h delay).
  - Structure is clear, professional, and engaging (e.g., numbered steps, bolding, positive close). Covers all visible elements without hallucination.

- **Minor deductions (-0.2)**:
  - Slight ambiguity in sequencing: "No special handling  directly to labeling" overlooks that the "no" path likely merges *before* insurance check (per image flow), but it's a tiny nitpick as Step 4 correctly follows.
  - No explicit mention of minor details like "Review shipment method" sub-task under clarify or exact arrow from "Customer information" database, but these are inferred well and not critical.

This is an outstanding description—concise, visual-friendly, and true to the flowchart. Perfect for business analysis or training!
