The provided answer is nearly flawless. It correctly uses window functions (`LEAD`) to detect the exact consecutive sequence per case (direct succession verified by partitioning and ordering), accurately computes the time delta between the specific 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events in matching triplets, excludes entire cases via an efficient anti-join (LEFT JOIN with IS NULL), and returns all events from non-excluded cases. DuckDB syntax is precise (e.g., `INTERVAL '5 days'`), handles edge cases (e.g., multiple sequences per case via `DISTINCT`, short cases via implicit NULLs), assumes standard event log properties without overcomplicating, and includes a clear explanation. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, inefficiencies, or unclarities; output matches requirements exactly (no extraneous ordering/grouping needed).
