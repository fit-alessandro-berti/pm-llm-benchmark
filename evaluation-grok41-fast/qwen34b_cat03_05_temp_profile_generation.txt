**7.2**

### Justification (hypercritical evaluation of final output only):
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: Format is flawless Python dictionary syntax (valid tuples for keys/values, seconds-based numerics matching example style like 86400). Includes 17 pairs: all 9 consecutive/main-chain pairs (correct order), plus 8 multi-step pairs demonstrating complexity (e.g., ('SS', 'RC') spans 1 step, ('SS', 'QI') spans 3, ('CA', 'WS') spans 3). Estimates are plausible for supply chain (e.g., SS-OP quick at 2h, assembly QI-CA at 7d, distribution/supplier variability high; std devs reasonable ~10-50% of avg). Representative subset balances direct/multi-step without excess (avoids 45+ linear pairs).
- **Flaws (strict penalties)**:
  - **Major logical inaccuracy**: ('DT', 'CA') is invalid—DT follows CA in the linear process (SS...CA...DTAS); DT never precedes CA in any trace. Violates "pairs ... that eventually follow each other" (first must precede second). This introduces a backward dependency, undermining model integrity. Significant deduction (-2.0).
  - **Inconsistent/ arbitrary std dev estimation for multi-step pairs**: E.g., ('SS', 'RC') avg correctly ~sum (266400s), but std (86400s) copies single-step without rationale (should approximate (sum sq) 86418s or estimated proportionally; minor but unclarified). Similar for ('SS', 'QI') (324000s arbitrary sum?). Not "nearly flawless" estimation. Deduction (-0.5).
  - **Minor unclarities**: Comments helpful but non-essential (ok); no coverage of potential variants (e.g., no SSAS full-chain), but "representative subset" allows. No syntax issues, but trailing comma after ('DT', 'AS') is fine.
- **Overall**: Strong structure/complexity (8.5 base), but logical flaw prevents >8.0; hypercritical lens demands precision in all pairs. Not flawless.
