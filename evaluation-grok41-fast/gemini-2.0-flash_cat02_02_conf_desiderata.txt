**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (supporting score above 5.0)**:
  - Correctly identifies Case 2's two key normative violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection). Explanations are precise and directly quote rules.
  - Correctly deems Case 1 fully normative-compliant and Case 3 normative-compliant.
  - Accurately identifies Case 3's desiderata failures (timings correctly calculated; notes Follow-up absence). Clarifies desiderata as non-severe ("optional", "missed opportunity").
  - Provides reasonable justifications/interpretations per task #3, aligned with constraints (e.g., workloads for delays; explicitly notes no justification for hard violations).
  - Good structure mirroring task (1,2,3), with helpful extras (adhering cases, summary) that enhance clarity without straying.
  - No factual errors in timings or log readings; language is professional.

- **Major Flaws (significant deductions)**:
  - **Critical inaccuracy in task #1 (normative violations)**: Completely misses that Case 2 **skips "Inform Applicant" entirely** after Loan Decision—a **strict normative requirement** ("Loan Decision  Inform Applicant"; "applicant must be informed of the outcome"; "no skipping steps"). Log has no such event for Case 2, yet answer lists only two violations. This is a core sequence violation equivalent in severity to the noted ones; failing to identify it means incomplete analysis of "which cases are violating" and "explain the reasons." Alone warrants ~2.0-3.0 deduction.
  - **Logical inconsistency in task #2 (desiderata)**: Flags "No Follow-up Call" as a desiderata "Violation 3" for Case 3 (despite calling it "optional"), but implicitly deems Case 1 perfect on desiderata ("compliant with all...recommendations (no violations)"). Case 1 log also lacks Follow-up Call (no event listed, like others). Desiderata explicitly includes it ("encouraged...before closing"); all cases fail it, yet answer selectively flags only Case 3. Summary reinforces error ("Case 1: Compliant with all normative rules and recommendations"). Hypocritical application; ~1.0 deduction.
  - **Minor unclarities/logical gaps**:
    - Labels desiderata issues as "Violates"/"Violation" (same term as normative)—muddles "not severe" clarification required by task.
    - Case 2 desiderata unaddressed (e.g., Risk Assessment ~20min after app <24h, but irrelevant due to normative fails; still, task asks "which cases" without exemption).
    - Justifications section good but could tie closer to log (e.g., Case 2's late Credit Check after Risk as evidence of "system error").
  - No suggestions for **Case 1** in #3 (task: "When possible, suggest interpretations...for the observed behaviors"—Case 1 has none deviant, but Follow-up absence warrants note as minor desideratum interpretation).

- **Overall**: ~70% flawless (strong on identified points), but misses a **pivotal normative violation** (skip Inform) and shows **inconsistent desiderata handling**—not "nearly flawless." Strict policy demands significant penalty for these; 10.0 impossible, 8+ unwarranted. 6.0 reflects solid effort with disqualifying gaps.
