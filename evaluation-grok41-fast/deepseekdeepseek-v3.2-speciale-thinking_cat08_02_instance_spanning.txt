**9.8**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
This answer is exceptionally strong—nearly flawless in structure, completeness, depth, and adherence to process mining principles—but deducts 0.2 for two minor issues: (1) the preemption identification method relies on inferring overlaps from timestamps/resource timelines, which is logically sound and practical but not perfectly robust without explicit pause/resume events (classical event logs assume atomic activities, potentially leading to minor overestimation of preemptions if resources switch without true pause); (2) Strategy 3's optional "process redesign" (dedicated area/higher limit) slightly veers into non-data-driven territory without quantifying feasibility/cost from logs, though it's framed well. These are trivial nitpicks in an otherwise impeccable, data-driven response that fully addresses all requirements with precise metrics, interactions, strategies, simulation details, and monitoring. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities; every section is comprehensive, practical, and constraint-focused.
