**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (driving high score)**: The list is highly targeted, open-ended, and comprehensively covers all required areas (missing details, e.g., Q2/Q5; decision criteria, e.g., Q3/Q8; roles/responsibilities, e.g., Q4/Q14; timing/sequencing, e.g., Q1/Q13; exceptions, e.g., Q11). No SQL or overt implementation details. Questions directly reference the described process without hallucinating elements. Logical categorization enhances clarity without being required. Final summary reinforces goals perfectly. Total coverage is thorough (16 questions without redundancy), conceptual focus is sharp, and phrasing encourages elaboration.
  
- **Minor Inaccuracies/Unclarities/Flaws (deductions)**:
  - **Leading examples (0.3 deduction)**: Multiple questions include suggestive specifics not in the original description (e.g., Q2: "historic buildings"; Q7: "virtual tours, social media"; Q8: "tiered pricing"; Q9: "APIs"). This subtly biases responses, reducing pure open-endedness despite being illustrative.
  - **Borderline technical probes (0.3 deduction)**: Q9/Q10 mention "APIs," "automated workflows," and "data discrepancies," edging toward implementation details (prompt bans these explicitly, even if conceptual). Contrasts with description's high-level "CRMs/project tools."
  - **Slight overlaps/minor imprecisions (0.2 deduction)**: Q6 misplaced under "Inspection" (it's end-stage audits); Q15/Q16 introduce "zoning laws/safety codes" and "profitability" validly but as minor extensions without tight description ties, risking scope creep.
  
No major logical flaws, verbosity, or incompleteness. Nearly flawless execution justifies score above 9.0; deductions are strict per instructions for even minor issues.
