**3.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Factual Inaccuracies (Severe Penalty: -4.0 base deduction)**: 
  - Claims C003's score is "715 (adjusted from 690 with community adjustments)" – entirely false; C003 (None community, no adjustments) starts and stays at 715 with 0 adjustments.
  - States non-community cases (C002/C005) "bypass manual review entirely... ManualReview column is 'N/A'" – false; all cases, including C002 (#3) and C005 (#5), have explicit ManualReview rows with reviewers listed.
  - Assumes uniform ~720 approval threshold – contradicted by C004 (700 Adjusted, Approved) vs. C003 (715, Rejected), undermining core logic.

- **Missed Key Biases (Major Penalty: -1.5)**: 
  - Completely ignores **LocalResident** (TRUE for all Approved except C005; FALSE only for Rejected C003 and Approved C005). Clear pattern: Non-local (FALSE) + None community rejected at 715 but approved at 740, implying bias against non-locals lacking affiliations/high scores. Question explicitly flags "geographic characteristics" – this is a central omission.
  - Overstates non-community "inherent[ly] higher base scores" as favoritism; bases vary widely (C002 720, C003 715, C005 740 vs. community 710/690), uncorrelated with outcomes without LocalResident context.

- **Logical Flaws/Unclarities (Moderate Penalty: -1.0)**: 
  - Contradictory claims: Simultaneously argues community boosts favor Highland *and* non-community bases favor "None" – ignores C004 (low-base community Approved at 700 via adjustment) vs. C003 (higher-base None Rejected).
  - "Self-reinforcing cycle" for community unproven/speculative; adjustments consistent but not shown as causal beyond data.
  - Threshold "ambiguity" section unclearly flips favoritism without resolution.

- **Strengths (Partial Credit: +0.7)**: Correctly identifies "+10 (Community)" adjustment tied to Highland Civic Darts Club (C001/C004) as favoring that group; touches equity implications for non-affiliated.

- **Structure/Completeness (Minor Credit: +0.0)**: Well-formatted, recommendations generic but on-topic; conclusion summarizes but propagates errors.

Nearly flawless requires zero factual errors, full coverage of attributes (esp. LocalResident/Community interplay), precise logic – absent here. Equivalent to ~30% accuracy on critical analysis.
