This response is exemplary and fully complies with the prompt in every respect. It delivers precisely 20 distinct, thought-provoking, open-ended questions, each meticulously tied to specific elements of the described supply chain (e.g., supplier countries in Q1, Malaysian assembly in Q10, JIT in Q3, digital systems/analytics in Q4/Q12, environmental/compliance aspects in Q5/Q6/Q8/Q14/Q15). All questions probe insights (e.g., Q17 on early-warning indicators), issues (e.g., Q7 on shortages), improvements (e.g., Q2 on collaboration), and decision implications (e.g., Q20 on incentives, Q5 on KPIs). No SQL queries, no extraneous text—just a clean numbered list. Questions are logically sound, clear, free of inaccuracies (e.g., countries/KPIs/process stages match description exactly), and hyper-relevant without overreach or vagueness. No ambiguities, repetitions, or flaws of any kind; it is flawless under hypercritical scrutiny.
