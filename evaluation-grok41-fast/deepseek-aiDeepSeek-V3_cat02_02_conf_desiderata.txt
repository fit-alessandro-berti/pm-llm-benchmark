**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
While the answer is well-structured, clearly written, and covers most elements logically, it contains a **significant inaccuracy in Part 1** that undermines completeness and correctness: it fails to identify the **skipping of "Inform Applicant"** in Case 2 as a normative violation. This is a *strict* requirement ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision"; "no skipping activities"). Case 2's log has **no "Inform Applicant" entry** after Decision (09:30)  Finalize (10:00)  Close (10:30), making this a clear sequence skip. Listing only "two ways" instead of three (Risk before Credit; no Inform; Finalize after Reject) is a major flaw, as it misrepresents the violations and propagates to Part 3 (justifications omit this).

**Strengths (why not lower than 6.0):**
- Correctly identifies Case 2 as the sole normative violator and accurately details the two violations it does catch.
- Part 2 is flawless: precisely flags Case 3's desiderata issues (timings correctly calculated; missing Follow-up noted only where log explicitly flags it; clarifies "suboptimal/not severe").
- Part 3 provides plausible, constraint-aligned justifications "when possible" (focused on observed behaviors); general note is apt.
- No unclarities; excellent formatting, reasoning tie-backs, and no contradictions.
- Case 1 correctly left unmentioned (full normative compliance; desiderata timings ideal, Follow-up not explicitly absent).

**Weaknesses (justifying deduction from 10.0; hypercritical lens):**
- **Major logical flaw/inaccuracy (Part 1 & 3):** Missed skipping "Inform Applicant" (core normative constraint). This isn't minor—it's a "strict sequence" violation equivalent to the ones listed, directly from "Key Normative Constraints" and "What is Not Allowed." Reduces credibility of entire analysis.
- **Minor incompleteness:** Doesn't explicitly state Case 1/3 have *no* normative violations (implied but not reinforced; task says "identify which cases").
- **No other issues** (e.g., timings precise; no overreach on desiderata for Case 1/2; no contradictions).

**Overall:** ~80% accurate but critically incomplete on a high-stakes element. "Nearly flawless" requires zero misses on strict rules (per instructions). 6.0 reflects strong execution marred by this pivotal error.
