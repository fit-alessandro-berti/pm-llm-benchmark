**8.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (near-flawless aspects)**: 
  - Perfectly identifies normative violations: Case 1 & 3 compliant; Case 2 correctly flags RA before CC (ordering violation), FD after rejection (contradictory action), and crucially missing Inform Applicant (skipping required step post-decision). Explanations precise, tied directly to rules with sequence references.
  - Desiderata fully covered: Correctly flags Case 3 timings (>24h CC, >48h Inform) and no follow-up (Cases 1&3); Case 1 as minor/optional; Case 2 deprioritized. Clarifies "not severe, suboptimal" via phrasing like "none critical," "optional omitted," "efficiency suffers."
  - Interpretations/justifications provided per case (Case 2: system glitch/training; Case 3: backlog/external delays), plausible and "in line with constraints," with actionable suggestions (retraining, safeguards, reminders). Key takeaways synthesize accurately.
  - Structure exemplary: Tables for clarity, comprehensive without verbosity, covers all tasks explicitly.

- **Flaws Penalized (strict deductions for inaccuracies/unclarities)**:
  - **Factual errors on timings (Case 3 desiderata)**: CC actual ~49 hours (not ">72 h" or "three-day lag" – Jan-12 09:00 to Jan-14 10:00 = 49h / ~2 days). Repeated in table & interpretations. Inform ~51h correct, but errors misstate deviation magnitude, risking confusion on extent (minor logical flaw, but hypercritical = significant deduction: -1.0).
  - No other violations/desiderata missed; no normative false positives; no unclarities in logic/explanations.
  - Cumulative: ~80% flawless (all core identifications/explanations perfect), 20% tainted by quantifiable errors  8.0 (high but not "very high/nearly flawless").
