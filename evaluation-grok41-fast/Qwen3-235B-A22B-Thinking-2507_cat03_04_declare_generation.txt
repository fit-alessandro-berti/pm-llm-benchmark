**10.0**

The final dictionary is complete, includes all required keys exactly as specified, uses correct formats (single-activity keys with (support, confidence) tuples for unary constraints; activity-pair tuples for binary constraints, aligning with standard pm4py DECLARE semantics despite the prompt's likely phrasing error), and accurately models the described linear sequential process. All constraints are logically valid, satisfied by the scenario's trace, and collectively enforce mandatory existence/exact-once for all activities, IG as init, and strict immediate sequential ordering via chainsuccession (with supporting chainresponse/chainprecedence), plus valid (if partially redundant) supplementary constraints like precedence/response/succession (which hold in the linear flow), targeted responded_existence for key dependencies (e.g., PC implying LT/UT), and coexistence for related phases (e.g., testing/approval-marketing pairs). Empties are appropriately used for inapplicable constraints (absence, alt*, non*). All values reasonably set to (1.0, 1.0) given no log data. Explanation clearly justifies choices without contradiction. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws; redundancies are valid overlaps in declarative modeling and do not invalidate the representation. Nearly (actually fully) flawless.
