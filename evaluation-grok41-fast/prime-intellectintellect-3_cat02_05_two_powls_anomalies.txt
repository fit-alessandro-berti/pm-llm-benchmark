**8.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**:
  - **Structure & Clarity**: Excellent. Uses sections, bullet points, table for comparison – highly readable. Directly addresses all 3 task elements (analysis, anomalies with severity, decision + justification).
  - **Core Analysis Accuracy**: Mostly precise on POWL semantics (partial orders require all nodes executed exactly once respecting edges; linear extensions allow reordering where unconstrained). Correctly identifies key anomalies:
    | Model | Correct Anomalies Noted |
    |-------|-------------------------|
    | 1     | Interview-decision decoupling (decision w/o interview possible); no InterviewDecide (post-decision interview possible); no negative path. |
    | 2     | Screen-interview decoupling (interview pre-screen possible); payroll skip (critical); onboarding loop (medium); no negative path; InterviewDecide (positive). |
  - **Severity Assessment**: Logical and business-aware (e.g., payroll skip as "critical" financial violation; interview logic high). Table effectively summarizes trade-offs.
  - **Decision & Justification**: Correct choice (**Model 1 better**). Valid reasoning: Model 2's extra critical flaws (payroll skip, loop) outweigh Model 1's (interview sequencing). Payroll mandatory in Model 1 aligns better with normative "hired employee must be paid." Negative path flaw equal in both.
  - **Standard Process Reference**: Accurate normative sequence + logic (screen before interview; interview before decide; conditional post-decision).

- **Flaws (strict deductions; -2.0 total)**:
  - **Factual Inaccuracy (major, -1.0)**: Model 2 point 5 claims "**Screen Optional**" – false. StrictPartialOrder requires **all nodes executed** (Screen included). Misstates semantics; implies skipping possible (only XOR/LOOP allow behavioral skips).
  - **Omission of Severe Anomaly (high, -0.5)**: Model 2 allows **Screen after Close** (no outgoing edges from Screen; valid linear extension: PostInterviewDecide...CloseScreen). Absurd (screening post-case closure); symmetric to Model 1's Interview-after-Close but unnoted, understates Model 2 flaws.
  - **Minor Inaccuracy/Unclarity (-0.25 each)**:
    - LOOP described as "**forces repeated onboarding**" – imprecise; at least once, zero+ repeats possible (not "forces repeated").
    - Model 2 anomalies summary: "**negative decision handling twice**" – unclear/redundant (listed once).
    - Table: Model 1 "**Interview Logic: Decoupled (flawed)**" accurate, but doesn't quantify probability (some traces force interview pre-decide via topo, but many don't).
    - Justification: "**Model 1 only forces onboarding/payroll for negative decisions**" – typo/malapropism (means "forces them regardless," but reads as distinguishing from Model 2).

- **Overall**: Nearly flawless (strong logic, business insight, correct conclusion), but factual error + omission prevent 9+. Strictness applied: inaccuracies = significant deduction. Equivalent to A- paper.
