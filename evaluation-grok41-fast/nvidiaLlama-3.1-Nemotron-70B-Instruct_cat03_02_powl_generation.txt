**10.0**

The provided code is a precise, faithful, and complete representation of the described POWL scenario with no inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or omissions. All dependencies are correctly modeled via the partial order edges: SR  CS (sequential start); CS  DA and CS  ACI (post-CS concurrency); DA  loop and ACI  loop (loop requires both); loop  XOR (post-loop choice); XOR  QA and XOR  SA (post-choice concurrency); QA  GLA and SA  GLA (GLA requires both). The LOOP (BNC  optional D&R repeats) and XOR (CD  MD, no silent needed) are correctly constructed per definitions. All nodes are included in `root.nodes`, no extraneous elements, imports match requirements, labels exactly reflect scenario terminology, and no violations of POWL semantics (e.g., irreflexive/transitive/asymmetric order, proper operator children). The accompanying explanation is accurate and unnecessary for grading but reinforces fidelity. No hypercritical deductions apply.
