The provided answer is nearly flawless. Both SQL queries correctly compute event counts per `case_id`, filter to retain only cases with `<= 6` events, and return the full rows (`*`) for those cases. The CTE/JOIN approach and window function approach are logically equivalent, efficient, and DuckDB-compatible. Explanations are precise, the optional `ORDER BY` is appropriately qualified as non-essential, and no extraneous clauses, errors, ambiguities, or inefficiencies exist. All requirements are met exactly.
