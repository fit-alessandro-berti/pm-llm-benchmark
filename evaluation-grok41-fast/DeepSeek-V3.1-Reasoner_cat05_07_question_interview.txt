The provided answer produces a comprehensive, precisely targeted list of 17 open-ended questions that flawlessly align with the prompt's requirements. It systematically uncovers missing details (e.g., Q2, Q6, Q7), decision criteria (e.g., Q4, Q8, Q10, Q11), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q5, Q7, Q14, Q17), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q1, Q15), and exception handling (e.g., Q12, Q13) without any mention of SQL, code, or low-level implementation. Questions are conceptually focused, directly reference the description's elements for relevance, and use clear phase-based organization for enhanced clarity. No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, logical flaws, or off-topic elements exist; every question elicits elaboration on process nuances from an interviewee perspective.
