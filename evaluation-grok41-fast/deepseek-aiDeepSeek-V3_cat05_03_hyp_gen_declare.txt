7.2

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (supporting the score):**
- **Structure and Completeness:** Perfectly mirrors the required sections (anomalies, hypotheses, verification). Hypotheses directly match and expand on prompt examples without copying. SQL queries are well-formatted, executable on given schema, and target key issues (e.g., #1 verifies closure without E, #2 directly tests noncoexistence violation).
- **Partial Accuracy in Anomalies:** Correctly flags noncoexistence(E,C) as problematic (undermines eval before close), notes weak sequencing (skips between R/C), and ties responded_existence to business logic issues. Implicitly captures existence(C) + noncoex => no E allowed.
- **Hypotheses:** Flawless—concise, relevant, 4 distinct reasons aligning with prompt examples.
- **SQL Relevance:** Queries 1-2 are precise and directly verifiable against model constraints (e.g., #2 finds E+C coexistence violations). #3 logically infers "correspondence" via same `resource`, useful for A/E linkage despite model oddities.

**Flaws Deducting Points (strict deductions for each):**
- **Anomaly 1 Inaccuracy (-1.0):** Claims "contradictory" noncoexistence vs. precedence(C > R). No actual conflict—precedence *allows* RC (weak), noncoex forbids E if C, but doesn't contradict RC path. "Implying C without evaluation" misstates: precedence *requires* only R before C, doesn't force or imply skipping E. Logical flaw reframes allowance as "contradiction."
- **Missing Key Anomalies (-1.0):** Ignores responded_existence(EA) directionality—flow is AE, making this *backwards* (anomalous/inverted). Also misses core contradiction: existence(C) + noncoex(E,C) = *E impossible ever*, rendering responded_existence vacuous/useless. Init(R) good but unmentioned; no full-sequence enforcement explicit.
- **Anomaly 2 Unclarity/Overreach (-0.5):** Links responded_existence solely to noncoex, ignoring its standalone inversion flaw. "Undermines logic requiring eval before closure" valid but derivative, not root.
- **SQL #3 Imprecision (-0.3):** Targets "corresponding adjusters" via same `resource` *existence*, but model responded_existence requires *A after E* (temporal). Query ignores order (uses NOT EXISTS without timestamp filter, e.g., `ce2.timestamp < ce.timestamp`). Misses `adjusters` table (prompt specifies using it, e.g., JOIN on `resource`~`adjuster_id/name`/`specialization`). Doesn't verify precedence/init.
- **Minor Polish Issues (-0.0 net, but noted):** No ties to `adjusters`/`specialization`/`region`; queries lack `ORDER BY` for traces; no aggregate checks (e.g., COUNT anomalies).

**Score Calculation:** Base 9.0 (strong coverage/structure/SQL1-2) minus 2.8 for above = 7.2. Not "nearly flawless" (core misidentifications/misses prevent 9+); good but not elite under hypercriticism.
