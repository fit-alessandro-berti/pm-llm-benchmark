**10.0**

The provided code is a precise, faithful, and complete representation of the described POWL model. It correctly constructs all required `Transition` nodes with exact labels, the `OperatorPOWL` for the loop (`*(BNC, "D&R")`) matching the repeat-until-stable semantics after DA/ACI, the XOR choice between CD/MD, and the root `StrictPartialOrder` integrating everything with accurate precedence edges:

- SR  CS (initial verification to contract).
- CS  DA, CS  ACI (parallel prep after CS; no DAACI edge enforces concurrency).
- DA  loop, ACI  loop (loop only after *both* complete).
- loop  xor (deployment choice post-configuration).
- xor  QA, xor  SA (both post-deployment; no QASA edge enforces concurrency/any-order).
- QA  GLA, SA  GLA (GLA only after *both*).

Transitivity ensures all implied orders (e.g., CS before loop). Nodes list mixes atomic `Transition`s and compound `OperatorPOWL`s as per POWL semantics and the advanced example. No extraneous edges, silent transitions, or deviations. Code is syntactically valid, self-contained, uses specified imports, and produces `root` as the full model. Zero inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws.
