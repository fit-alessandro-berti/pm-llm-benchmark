The final dictionary is a flawless response to the task. It is syntactically valid Python, uses exact activity labels as tuples, includes a representative subset (16 pairs) mixing adjacent and multi-step pairs (e.g., SS-DT spans 8 steps, OP-PT spans 3 steps) for complexity, and provides plausible, consistently derived estimates in seconds (e.g., supplier lead times ~1 week, manufacturing/shipping days, SDs ~10-30% of avgs or variance-based). All pairs respect sequential order, cover diverse spans (early-to-late, mid-to-end), and align with supply chain realism. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws; estimations are precise enough without over- or under-specifying.
