**6.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
This grade reflects a solid structure and correct identification of *some* key sequence anomalies (e.g., shipping/confirmation before credit checks in 1002/1003/1004), but is dragged down significantly by **critical flaws** in SQL correctness/logic, **omission of required hypotheses**, incomplete anomaly coverage, unclarities, and logical gaps. Even "good" elements have minor issues. Nothing is flawless.

#### Strengths (Minimal Credit):
+ **Anomaly ID (+1.5):** Correctly spots major deviations (out-of-order shipment/credit/payment in 1002/1003/1004). Ties to business risk well.
+ **Query Relevance (+1.5):** Queries target sequences/resources; Q1/Q2 broadly useful for investigation.
+ **Structure (+0.5):** Clear sections, case analyses, severity notes.
+ **Use of Schema (+0.5):** References `orders`/`resources` appropriately in some queries.
+ **No Irrelevant Content (+0.5):** Stays on-topic.

#### Major Deductions (-3.8 total):
- **Missing Hypotheses (-2.0):** Prompt *explicitly requires* hypothesizing *causes* (e.g., "system errors, policy violations, training issues"). Answer describes *risks* ("high risk", "poor controls", "breakdown in protocol") but never hypothesizes *why* (e.g., "rushed Logistics due to priority order_type policy violation?", "Finance system glitch allowing pre-invoice payments?", "training gap for new clerks?"). This is a core requirement—omission is disqualifying.
- **Incomplete Anomalies (-1.0):** 
  - Ignores **missing steps**: No Credit Check/Validate Stock in 1004; no Validate Stock in 1003. These are glaring (enable shipping/payment without checks).
  - Misses payment *before* invoice in 1004 (logical flaw: payment without invoice?).
  - Ignores `additional_info` flags (e.g., 1004 `shipment_scheduled=N` but shipped—policy violation?).
  - Vague on resources ("might indicate training gaps") without specifics (e.g., same clerk across depts?).
  - Case 1001 unmentioned (good baseline, but contrast strengthens analysis).
- **SQL Inaccuracies/Flaws (-0.8):**
  | Query | Issues |
  |-------|--------|
  | Q1 | Overly complex/unnecessary CTEs/pairs (cartesian explosion risk on large data). Uses raw activity strings (brittle). Misses many pairs (e.g., non-immediate). Works for examples but not general. |
  | Q2 | Good, but tangential (lags  anomalies); assumes both events exist (HAVING filters well, minor +). |
  | **Q3** | **Broken logic**: LEFT JOIN to *any* later T2 (multi-row duplication per case). WHERE `(T2.activity IS NULL OR != 'Confirm')` meaningless (T2 not filtered by activity in JOIN). Captures 1003 correctly by accident via NOT EXISTS, but unreliable/flawed for scale. |
  | **Q4** | **Major bugs**: `SUBSTR` garbage (e.g., 'Ship Goods'  'Ship'  dept). WHERE CASE hardcoded but inconsistent with SELECT. Arbitrary filter `R.department NOT IN ('Unknown', 'Finance')` excludes valid mismatches. No actual mismatches in sample data anyway—pointless. Brittle string-matching. |

#### Minor Deductions (-1.0 total):
- **Unclarities/Logical Flaws (-0.4):** "Resource Role Inconsistencies" section vague/handwavy ("might reveal overlap"). Q1 comments misleading ("pairs of sequential"—not sequential, any prior). No ties between queries/anomalies/hypotheses.
- **No Breadth (-0.3):** No queries for **missing activities** (e.g., `GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN activity='Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 END)=0`), order_value correlation to skips, or customer/order_type patterns.
- **Style/Precision (-0.3):** Typos (e.g., "$\rightarrow$" LaTeX), redundant DISTINCTs, no LIMIT/EXPLAIN for Postgres perf.

#### Path to 10.0:
Fix *all* SQL bugs, add 2-3 queries for missing steps/resources, explicitly hypothesize 2-3 causes *per anomaly* with query links (e.g., "Policy violation? Query: SELECT * WHERE order_type='priority' AND ..."), cover *all* cases/anomalies/flags. Zero flaws. This is ~60% there but fails on precision/requirements.
