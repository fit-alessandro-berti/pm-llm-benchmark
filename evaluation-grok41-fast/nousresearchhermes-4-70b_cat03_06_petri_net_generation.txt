**3.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (why not 1.0)**: The code correctly uses pm4py classes and utils. Places and transitions cover all required activities with proper labels (CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL). Loops for DV/RDS and FC/II are modeled via non-deterministic conflicts/self-loops on shared places (acceptable for Petri nets without guards). Approval conditional is correctly handled with shared t_P transition having dual inputs (p_CA for skip, p_P for approve path), allowing merge post-CA. Sequence up to p_N is mostly logical. Initial token intent via p_start is clear.
- **Major Flaws (severe deductions)**:
  - **Incomplete code**: Cuts off mid-arc at `petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p` (likely p_N -> t_N). No arcs for t_N input/output, p_CL, t_CL, or p_end. t_N/t_CL are added but unconnected—token cannot reach p_end from p_N. Net does not allow final marking reachability, failing "accepting Petri net" core requirement.
  - **Missing im/fm definitions**: Task explicitly requires "define both the initial marking (im) and final marking (fm)". Absent entirely—no `im = Marking({p_start: 1})` or `fm = Marking({p_end: 1})`. Cannot form `(net, im, fm)` tuple or verify acceptance.
  - **Logical/structural issues**:
    - DV loop (p_DV  t_DV, p_DV  t_RDS, p_DV  t_FC) allows unintended firings (e.g., arbitrary t_DV repeats without "verification complete" guard; non-determinism excessive, could loop DV forever without RDS/FC). Similarly minor for FC/II.
    - No transition/input for "C" (filing), but initial token ok—yet p_start  t_CR skips explicit modeling if intended.
    - No `net.transitions.add()` explicit for t_CA? Wait, loop includes it, but verify: list has t_CA, ok.
  - **Clarity/robustness**: No comments on non-determinism risks. Places/transitions added correctly, but unconnected end breaks flow. No validation (e.g., petri_utils.check_soundness not needed, but net unusable).
- **Why not higher**: Incompleteness + missing im/fm are disqualifying (direct task violations). Even if "nearly" complete, strictness demands flawlessness—minor non-determinism ok, but core omissions drop to low score. Equivalent to half-baked implementation.
