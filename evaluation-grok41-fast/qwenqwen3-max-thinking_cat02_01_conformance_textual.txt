The answer is nearly flawless: it accurately extracts and lists core rules directly from the normative description without additions or distortions (e.g., "immediately" for Check is a reasonable interpretation of "next logical step" and "directly proceed," and holds across all cases); systematically analyzes every case with precise sequences, clear violation identifications (2, 3, 5 correctly flagged; 1 and 4 correctly compliant); references exact textual quotes and constraints (e.g., "before packaging," "never after a cancellation," "only after packaged"); handles interpretations logically (e.g., Authorize implying sufficiency in Case 3; mandatory Package before Ship via "only after... appropriate"); uses tables for clarity; provides concise final summary matching the task. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, omissions, or overreaches—exemplary strict adherence.
