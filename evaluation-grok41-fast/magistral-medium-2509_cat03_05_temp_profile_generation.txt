The final answer provides a valid, syntactically correct Python dictionary precisely matching the required format: keys as tuples of activity labels (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`), values as tuples `(average_time, standard_deviation)` in seconds. It includes a representative subset of 14 pairs (9 direct/consecutive, 5 non-consecutive spanning multiple steps, e.g., `('SS', 'QI')` skipping OP/RC, `('CA', 'DT')` skipping PT/PK/WS), ensuring complexity as specified. Estimates are realistic for a high-tech electronics supply chain (e.g., long OP-RC lead times ~30 days, short RC-QI ~12h; cumulative times consistent, like `('SS', 'RC')`  `('SS', 'OP')` + `('OP', 'RC')`; std devs proportional ~20-40% of avgs, plausible for variability). Comments clarify pairs without extraneous content. Brief closing explanation directly addresses requirements. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, inconsistencies, or deviations from specs—nearly flawless execution.
