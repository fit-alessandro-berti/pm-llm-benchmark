The provided answer is a nearly flawless response to the prompt. It delivers a comprehensive, well-structured list of 16 targeted, open-ended questions, categorized logically by workflow stages for enhanced clarity and flow. Every question directly addresses key objectives: uncovering missing details (e.g., intake mechanisms, data verification), decision criteria (e.g., assignment logic, screening hierarchy), roles/responsibilities (e.g., sign-off authority, ownership), timing/sequencing (e.g., marketing parallelism, end-to-end timelines), and exceptions (e.g., audit failures, repair thresholds, PM transitions). All questions are phrased inquisitively to deepen conceptual understanding without any technical, SQL, or implementation specifics. No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or logical flaws; examples in questions (e.g., Q1) are illustrative without leading, and probes are precise extensions of the described process gaps. The categorization and numbering make it interviewee-friendly and professional.
