**2.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
- **Structural correctness (minor positive)**: Keys match exactly. Values are properly formatted as sets of tuples (except `activ_freq` dict). All activities covered. +1 point baseline.
- **Equivalence (major flaw)**: Misused entirely. Chained pairs imply strict co-occurrence counts (e.g., #RO == #CA), but comments describe mere implication/existence, not equivalence. Incomplete chain (skips CARI link). Unnecessary/redundant for linear process; should likely be empty set. -2.0.
- **Always Before (catastrophic flaw)**: **Completely backwards**. Definition requires `(later, earlier)` tuples (e.g., `('RI', 'CA')` for CA before RI). All 8 tuples reversed (e.g., `('CA', 'RI')` wrongly enforces RI before CA). Comments correctly describe intent but code contradicts. Invalidates entire model. -3.0.
- **Always After (partial flaw)**: Direction correct (includes ROCA), but fully redundant with `directly_follows`. Overkill repetition without adding value. Minor: "in one of the following events" implies possible intermediates, but all direct. -0.5.
- **Never Together (catastrophic flaw)**: Tuples `('RO', 'GSL')` and `('IC', 'RI')` prohibit co-existence in traces, but scenario mandates all activities in every case (linear fulfillment). No valid traces possible. Arbitrary/wrong examples; should be empty or for truly exclusive pairs (none here). -2.5.
- **Activ Freq (moderate flaw)**: RO `{0,1}` illogical (orders start with RO; `{1}` expected). All others `{1}` reasonable but RP potentially `{0,1}` ("once pays"—optional). Conflicts with equivalence (RO=0 forbids CA=1). No upper bounds needed but inconsistent with process. -1.0.
- **Directly Follows (moderate flaw)**: Sequence correct but misses ROCA (chain starts CARI). Redundant with after/before. Assumes no branches/intermediates, fitting scenario. -0.5.
- **Overall logic/process fidelity (major flaw)**: Captures linear flow superficially but breaks on directions, invalid prohibitions, redundancies, gaps (RO isolated), and misconceptions (equivalence as implication). Unnecessary `print()`. Comments contradict code in places. Scenario implies mandatory sequence; model allows invalids/blocks valids. -1.0.
- **Strictness adjustment**: Major logical flaws (backwards constraints, invalid prohibitions) make model unusable. Minor syntax ok, but no "nearly flawless"—far from it.

**Total: 2.0** (baseline structure minus overwhelming inaccuracies).
