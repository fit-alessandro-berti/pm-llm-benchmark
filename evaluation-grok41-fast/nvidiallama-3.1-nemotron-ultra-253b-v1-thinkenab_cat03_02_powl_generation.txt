**10.0**

The provided code faithfully and precisely constructs the POWL model matching the scenario:

- All required `Transition` nodes use exact labels (e.g., "D&R" for Debug & Reconfigure).
- `loop_node` correctly uses `Operator.LOOP` with `[BNC, D_R]`, modeling the repeat-until-stable loop (BNC then optional D&R).
- `xor_node` correctly uses `Operator.XOR` with `[CD, MD]` for exclusive deployment choice.
- `root` `StrictPartialOrder` includes exactly the necessary nodes (atomic transitions + operator nodes).
- Order edges perfectly enforce:
  - SR  CS.
  - CS  DA and CS  ACI (post-CS concurrency: no DAACI edge).
  - DA  loop_node and ACI  loop_node (loop after *both* DA/ACI).
  - loop_node  xor_node.
  - xor_node  QA and xor_node  SA (post-deployment concurrency: no QASA edge).
  - QA  GLA and SA  GLA (GLA after *both* QA/SA).
- Transitive partial order ensures full sequencing (e.g., SR before everything via chains).
- No extraneous nodes, edges, silent transitions, or nesting needed (direct inclusion of operators as nodes matches the provided example).
- Imports, syntax, and structure are exact and executable.

No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or deviations.
