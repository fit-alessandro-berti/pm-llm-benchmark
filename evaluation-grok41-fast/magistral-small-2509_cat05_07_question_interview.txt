The provided answer delivers a precisely structured, comprehensive list of 21 open-ended questions, meticulously categorized to mirror the process stages (e.g., Documentation Review through Process Coordination). Each question directly targets the specified goals: uncovering missing details (e.g., specific documents, common issues), decision criteria (e.g., factors for manager assignment, tenant evaluation), roles/responsibilities (e.g., who verifies details, conducts audits), timing/sequencing (e.g., timelines from contact to inspection, response times, review frequencies), and exceptions (e.g., discrepancies, special conditions, challenging examples). No questions veer into SQL, implementation, or non-conceptual territory; all probe purely for process understanding (e.g., validation methods, prioritization, coordination without tool specifics). Coverage is exhaustive yet concise, with no redundancies, ambiguities, or logical gaps—every major element from the description (e.g., regional-central coordination, custom clauses, inspections, marketing triggers) is addressed. The closing statement perfectly encapsulates the intent without fluff. Utterly flawless execution.
