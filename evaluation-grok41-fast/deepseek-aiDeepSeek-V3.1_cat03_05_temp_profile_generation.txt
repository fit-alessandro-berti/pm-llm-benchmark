**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**:
  - Correct format: Valid Python dict structure with tuple keys (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`) and value tuples `(avg, std)`. All times/SDs positive, in seconds, realistic for supply chain (e.g., 30d lead times for OP/RC, hours for assembly/testing, 30d for DT-AS).
  - Comprehensive coverage: Includes **all 45 forward pairs** in the implied linear order SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS, capturing "eventually following" pairs across multiple steps (e.g., SS-AS separated by 8 steps). Demonstrates complexity as required.
  - Realistic estimates: Plausible domain knowledge (1d for SS-OP, 30d procurement lead, quick manufacturing steps ~1.5h each, 30d post-shipment support). SDs scale reasonably (small for short intervals, ~10-15d for long/variable ones).
  - Mostly additive: Perfect additivity from RC onward (e.g., RC-QI 5400 + QI-CA 5400 = RC-CA 10800). OP onward mostly additive to intermediates.

- **Inaccuracies/Logical Flaws (strict deductions, -1.8 total)**:
  - **Major systematic inconsistency for SS pairs (-1.0)**: Averages/SDs for SSX (X after OP) exactly copy OPX values, omitting SS-OP (86400s/1d). E.g., SS-RC = OP-RC = 2592000s (30d), but should be ~2678400s (31d). This implies time(SS,RC) = time(OP,RC), making time(SS,OP) effectively 0—logically impossible in a sequential model. Affects **9/45 entries** (~20%). SDs also non-propagated (no (var1 + var2)).
  - **Numerical additivity errors in long chains (-0.5)**: OP-AS/SS-AS = 5256000s (~60.83d), but OP-DT (2624400s) + DT-AS (2646000s) = 5270400s (~61d), off by 14400s (4h, ~0.4d or 0.7%). Similar for SS-AS. Precision flaws in estimation.
  - **Overly exhaustive vs. "representative subset" (-0.2)**: Prompt specifies "a representative subset", implying selective (e.g., 10-20 pairs mixing direct/distant for complexity), not every possible pair (45 exhaustive). Adds bloat without need.
  - **Minor unclarities/domain nitpicks (-0.1)**: WS-DT/PK-WS at 1.5h avg seems short for "storage until shipping" (variable demand); SDs fixed at 864000s for most long pairs ignores proper variance propagation.

- **Scoring Logic**: Base 10.0 for perfect format/scope. Deduct proportionally for flaws (not "nearly flawless"—systematic logic errors prevent 9+). 8.2 reflects strong effort with clear but non-trivial issues; flawless would require fully additive/consistent times, proper subset, no copy-paste artifacts.
