**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Task 1 (Identification of Long Cases)**: **Near-perfect (9.8/10)**. Correctly flags 102, 104, 105 as outliers vs. 101/103 normals. Times accurately approximated (e.g., 102 exactly 25h10m from 08:05 to next 09:15; 104 24h10m; 105 ~49h5m, listed as ~48h5m—minor ~1h rounding error). Table clear. **Deduction**: Summary phrase "resolution times 24 hours" inaccurately lumps 105 (~49h) with others; imprecise and misleading.
  
- **Task 2 (Root Causes)**: **Excellent (9.7/10)**. Precisely ties escalations to 102/105 with evidence (e.g., 19h/24h waits post-escalation). Captures waits in all three (quantified gaps like 3.5h/19h). Adds agent capacity/availability and inefficient process—logical from data (overnight stalls). **No major flaws**, evidence-based.

- **Task 3 (Explanation & Recommendations)**: **Strong (9.4/10)**. Clearly explains causes (e.g., Level-2 bottlenecks, handoffs, poor triage via Case 105 example). Links to cycle times (e.g., multi-day gaps). Recommendations actionable/practical (prioritization, AI triage, SLAs, scheduling)—directly address factors. Key insight concise. **Minor deductions**: SLA "<4-hour" arbitrary (data normals <3h total, but not data-derived); overlooks potential weekend factor (Mar1 Fri? to Mar3 Sun?—timestamps imply but unstated).

**Overall Strengths**: Flawless structure (tables enhance readability), data-driven, comprehensive patterns (escalations + non-escalation delays), insightful (overnight handoffs). Addresses all task elements without omissions.

**Overall Weaknesses**: Single clarity inaccuracy in summary phrasing; trivial time approximation slips; recommendations solid but not 100% data-exact. **Nearly flawless**—strictly docks 0.8 for precision issues. No logical flaws, unclarities minimal.
