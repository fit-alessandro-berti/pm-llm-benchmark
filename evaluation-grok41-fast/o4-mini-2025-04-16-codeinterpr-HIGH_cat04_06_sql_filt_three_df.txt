This solution is flawless. It precisely identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence using `LEAD` over timestamp-ordered partitions per `case_id`, correctly applies the >5-day filter between the specific 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' timestamps in that sequence, collects distinct bad `case_id`s, and excludes all events from those cases in the final result. DuckDB syntax (including `INTERVAL '5 days'`) is accurate. Edge cases (e.g., multiple sequences per case, short cases, 5-day gaps) are handled correctly by design. Ordering is sensible and stable. Explanation is concise, accurate, and mirrors the logic without extraneous details. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or inefficiencies detected.
