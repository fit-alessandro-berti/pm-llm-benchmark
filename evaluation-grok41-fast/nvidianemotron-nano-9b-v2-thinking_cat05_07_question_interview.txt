**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: 
  - Perfect adherence to open-ended format: Every question invites elaboration without yes/no traps (minor sub-clauses like in Q4 are non-leading).
  - Comprehensive coverage of **exact prompt criteria**: Missing details (Q1-5), decision criteria (Q6-9), roles/responsibilities (Q10-12), timing/sequencing (Q13-15), exceptions (Q16-18). No gaps; directly probes described process steps (e.g., docs, assignment, inspection, screening, audits).
  - Conceptual only: No SQL, code, or tech implementation; stays high-level (e.g., Q2/Q3/Q18 probe process impact/flow of tools/workflows mentioned in description, not specifics like "what software?").
  - Excellent structure: Categorized for clarity, logical flow mirrors process; intro/outro precise and on-prompt.
  - Targeted depth: Uncovers nuances (e.g., Q9 on negotiations, Q17 on challenges) without fluff; 20 questions are a "series" without excess verbosity.

- **Minor Flaws (strict deductions, preventing 10.0)**:
  - **Q19-20 off-prompt scope (-0.5)**: Introduce "improvements" and "feedback influence on future iterations," absent from prompt's aims (clarify *current* process only). These speculate beyond understanding the described workflow; meta/forward-looking, not "missing details" of existing steps.
  - **Borderline implementation hints (-0.2)**: Q3 ("specific tool or workflow"), Q18 ("tools or systems") edge toward details (prompt bans "implementation details"). Conceptual since description already cites CRMs/tools, but hypercritically, could be purer (e.g., rephrase to "how ensured?").
  - **Slight leading phrasing (-0.1)**: Rare "e.g." examples (Q8, Q11, Q17) subtly guide; ideal questions fully neutral (minor, as still open-ended).

Nearly flawless execution; deductions only for these precise nitpicks under utmost strictness.
