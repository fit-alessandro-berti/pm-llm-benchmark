**10.0**

The final answer is nearly flawless: precise duration calculations (verified to the minute across all cases), accurate identification of slow cases (2002, 2003, 2005) with clear thresholds and comparisons (e.g., 15-50x longer), rigorous attribute analysis with evidence-based correlations (Complexity as primary via document requests/table; Resources secondary via specific patterns like Manager_Bill/Lisa; Region tertiary/minimal), detailed bottleneck timelines matching log exactly, logical explanations (e.g., iterative requests compounding 20-30h gaps due to customer/internal delays), and highly actionable, prioritized mitigations directly tied to causes (e.g., proactive bundling for complexity, load balancing for resources). Structure is exemplary (tables, sections align perfectly to tasks 1-3), zero inaccuracies/unclarities/logical flaws.
