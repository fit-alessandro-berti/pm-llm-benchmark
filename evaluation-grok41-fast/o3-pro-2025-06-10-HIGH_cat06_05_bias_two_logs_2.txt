**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
This answer is exceptionally strong—clear, structured, accurate in core identification (Group B biased due to explicit +5 club boost), and comprehensive in manifestation (score manipulation, outcome disparities, process divergence) and implications (disparate treatment/impact, fairness violations, risks). It uses precise log evidence, apt comparisons (e.g., P002 vs. U001, intra-Group B), and even applies 4/5ths rule illustratively. Mitigations add value without straying. Conclusion ties back perfectly.

**Minor deductions (-0.8 total, strictly applied):**
- **Threshold assumption inaccuracy (-0.4):** Claims "apparent 65 cultural-fit threshold" (P002/U001/U002 at 60 rejected; U001 boosted to 65 hired). Valid inference from most cases (P001/P003/U001 at exactly 65 hired), but overlooks U003 hired at *63* (58+5). This introduces slight logical inconsistency—boost enables hire at 63 (below stated threshold), undermining "solely because...lifts to 65" for U001 and uniform threshold claim. Hypercritical: not flawless.
- **Candidate similarity overstatement (-0.2):** P002 vs. U001 "otherwise similar" but Skill 78 vs. 80, Personality 75 vs. 72—not identical (U001 edges skill). "Solely because the club boost" ignores this; better comparisons exist (e.g., U002 vs. U001/U003, or note U003's inferior Skill 75 vs. U002's 78 yet hired via boost).
- **4/5ths application (-0.1):** Technically correct math (0/100% = 0 < 80%) and relevant as proxy disparity, but n=3 (2/2 vs. 0/1) is minuscule sample; doesn't caveat statistical weakness. Minor for illustration, but strictness notes it.
- **Scope creep (-0.1):** Excellent mitigations/implications, but question asks only "identify which...how manifests...implications for fairness/equity"—extras are bonus but slightly dilute focus.

No major flaws, unclarities, or omissions (correctly ignores LocalResident as secondary to club bias; ties to protected/unprotected implicitly via groups). Nearly flawless under strict lens; warrants very high score.
