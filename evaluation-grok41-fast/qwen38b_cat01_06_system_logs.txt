**7.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting ~7+ score):** Comprehensive coverage of all 26 raw events in a well-formatted CSV-like table with required attributes (Case ID, Activity, Timestamp) plus useful extras (App, Window, Additional Info). Activity names are meaningfully abstracted and mostly context-aware (e.g., email-specific steps like "Open Email"  "Send Email" form a coherent sub-process). Cases grouped by artifact (document/email/PDF/spreadsheet) align with prompt examples for logical units. Explanation provided, structured, and mostly clear on logic.
- **Major Flaws (strict deductions):**
  - **Factual inaccuracy in event mapping (severe, -1.5):** Excel start event (09:05:00, raw: `FOCUS,App=Microsoft Excel,Window=Budget_2024.xlsx`) incorrectly labeled "Switch Application" in table instead of "Open Document" (consistent with other FOCUS events). This misrepresents the raw log, violating "transform the provided... log" and "each event... correspond to a meaningful activity."
  - **Logical flaw in case coherence/gaps (severe, -1.0):** Cases `Case_Quarterly_Report` and `Case_Document1` have large temporal gaps (~8min for Quarterly: 08:59  09:07; ~5min for Document1: 09:01  09:06) with no intervening activity on those artifacts. This breaks "coherent narrative" of "user work sessions" and "logical unit of user work"; events per case won't form clean sequences when sorted by time in mining tools (jumps/idles distort analysis). Better: split into contiguous sessions (e.g., `Quarterly_Session1`, `Document1_Session2`) for "analyst-friendly."
  - **Inconsistent standardization (moderate, -0.5):** Activity names vary by context without full uniformity (e.g., "Edit Document"/"Edit Email"/"Edit Budget"; "Scroll Email" vs "Scroll Document"). Prompt demands "standardized activities... higher-level process steps"; could use e.g., "Draft Content," "Review Artifact."
  - **Flawed transition handling (moderate, -0.3):** SWITCH/FOCUS inconsistently treated as "Switch Application" only in target cases (e.g., ok for Email/PDF/Doc1 return, wrong for Excel). Transitions feel artificial; better omit or standardize as "Start Task."
- **Minor Flaws (cumulative -0.7):** Explanation inaccuracies (e.g., Case_Document1 times "09:00–09:06" ignores 09:07 CLOSE; "parallel tasks" but log is strictly sequential; SWITCH "marks end/start" ignores raw FOCUS starts like Excel/Quarterly final). No derived attributes (e.g., duration, session ID). Initial Quarterly "Open Document" lacks work (just peek?), weakening narrative.
- **Why not lower?** No missing events, strong overall structure/story (e.g., full email flow), plausible inference. Why not higher? Not "nearly flawless"—inaccuracies/logic gaps prevent 9+ under hypercritical lens.
