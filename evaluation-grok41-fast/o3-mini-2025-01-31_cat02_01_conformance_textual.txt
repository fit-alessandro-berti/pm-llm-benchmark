**8.0**

### Rationale for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**:
  - Correctly identifies deviating cases: 2, 3, and 5 (only these truly deviate; 1 and 4 conform perfectly).
  - Clear structure: Per-case breakdown with sequences and analysis, plus concise summary.
  - Accurate core violations:
    - Case 2: Precisely flags "Package items" before "Authorize payment" (direct match to "Authorize payment... before packaging").
    - Case 3: Correctly flags "Ship order" after "Cancel order" (matches "never after a cancellation"; "illogical to continue with... shipping").
    - Case 5: Correctly flags omission of "Package items" before "Ship order" (matches required sequence and "only after... packaged").
  - References normative description effectively (e.g., order constraints, branches).
  - No factual errors in sequence transcription or timestamps ignored properly (focuses on activity order).

- **Flaws (strict deductions, preventing 10.0 or 9.0)**:
  - **Significant incompleteness in Case 3 (major logical flaw, -1.5)**: Lists full sequence (Receive  Check  **Authorize payment**  Cancel  Ship  Close) but **ignores "Authorize payment" before "Cancel order" as a violation**. Normative text implies strict branching post-Check: sufficient  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close; insufficient  **directly** Cancel  Close. "Authorize payment only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known" and is tied to sufficient path—doing it then Canceling contradicts this (logically indicates wrong branch taken; payment auth shouldn't precede Cancel). Analysis reduces to only Ship-after-Cancel, presenting "cancellation branch" as if starting cleanly at Cancel (ignores prior deviation). This is an inaccuracy in interpreting "direct" progression and branch exclusivity.
  - **Minor unclarity in Case 2 (-0.2)**: Flags packaging before auth correctly but doesn't note downstream issue (Ship occurs without post-auth Package in correct position, though Package happened early—still violates "Package... after authorization"). Not exhaustive.
  - **Minor overgeneralization in Case 3 (-0.2)**: Says "cancellation branch should be... Receive Check Cancel Close" but sequence has extra Authorize; phrasing implies minor Ship deviation only, underplaying branch violation.
  - **No mention of secondary Case 3 issues (-0.1)**: No Package at all before Ship (extra violation per "before shipping").
  - **Formatting nitpicks (-0.0, negligible but noted)**: Sequences use spaces ("Receive order  Check") not arrows (), slightly less readable; bullet style inconsistent.

- **Overall**: Nearly flawless identification and mostly precise explanations (85-90% coverage), but incompleteness/oversight in Case 3 is a clear logical inaccuracy (misses key implied rule), warranting deduction to 8.0. Hyperstrict lens: flawless requires **all** violations explained per case with zero gaps in interpretation. This is strong but not "nearly flawless."
