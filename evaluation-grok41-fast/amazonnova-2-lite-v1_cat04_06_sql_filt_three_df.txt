**9.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
The core SQL query is **flawless** (10/10): it correctly uses `LAG` window functions to detect *exact consecutive succession* (no intervening events, as any would shift `LAG` values), measures the precise time diff between the specific `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` in the triplet (>5 days via `INTERVAL '5 days'`), collects matching `case_id`s distinctly, and excludes *entire cases* meeting *both* criteria while returning **all events** (`SELECT *`) from remaining cases. Ordering is proper. Handles multiple triplets per case correctly. DuckDB-compatible. Efficient for event logs.

**Deductions (total -1.0, strictly applied for minor issues):**
- **Example test data (-0.5)**: C2 diff is ~5 days 1 hour > `INTERVAL '5 days'` (Apr 3 10:00 to Apr 8 11:00), so query *excludes* C2 correctly per prompt, but comment falsely claims `"<= 5 days should be kept"` – miscalculation inaccuracy that misleads testers/readers.
- **Explanatory comments/notes (-0.3)**: 
  - CTE comment wrongly states `diff_to_prev_prev` is "time from 'Approve Purchase Requisition' to 'Create Order'" (actually Confirm-Approve).
  - Unnecessary/misleading note on "extra strict" check (`LAG` *already* enforces consecutiveness perfectly); confuses with "number of rows between... exactly 2 (i.e., only the three events exist in that slice)" – poorly worded (1 row between first/third; case can have other events).
- **Unclarities (-0.2)**: Minor over-explanation (e.g., `diff_to_prev_prev NOT NULL` redundant with activity checks but harmless); assumes unique/strictly increasing timestamps (valid for event logs, but unstated edge case).

Nearly perfect (query solves benchmark precisely); deductions only for non-core explanatory flaws. Lower would be unfair to functional excellence.
