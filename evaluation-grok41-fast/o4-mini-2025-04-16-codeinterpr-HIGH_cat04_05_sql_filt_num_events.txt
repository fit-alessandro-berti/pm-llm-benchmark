**9.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Correctness (flawless)**: Both queries precisely achieve the task. CTE + JOIN correctly identifies `case_id`s with `<=6` events via `GROUP BY`/`HAVING` and retrieves all matching rows. Window function approach accurately computes per-case counts without grouping loss and filters correctly. Both handle arbitrary additional columns implicitly (though see below). DuckDB-compatible (CTEs, windows, etc.). Results match exactly: full rows for short cases only.
- **Completeness**: Returns exactly the required events. Covers "full set" via join/window (not a subselect that drops rows).
- **Efficiency/Clarity**: Both efficient (CTE avoids window overhead for large tables; window is concise). Clear aliasing, no redundant computations.
- **Explanation**: Precise, step-by-step, highlights key mechanics (grouping/filtering). Notes optional ORDER BY (helpful for event logs, chronological per case). Acknowledges column flexibility.
- **Bonus**: Two valid alternatives enhance robustness (CTE more performant/scalable; window simpler).

**Minor Deductions (strict application)**:
- **Column Selection (-0.5)**: Selects only `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp` instead of `e.*` or `*` (post-filter). Prompt specifies "at least these columns" and "full set of events" (full rows). If extra columns exist (likely in real event logs), data loss occurs. Explanation hedges "all columns (or a subset)", introducing minor unclarity/hedge vs. "full set." Window inner `*` is dropped in outer SELECT—suboptimal. Pedantic but logical flaw per "full events."
- **ORDER BY (-0.2)**: Added without prompt requirement (nice-to-have, but extraneous; could mislead if order matters).
- **No EXISTS/IN variant**: Cleaner single-pass options exist (e.g., `WHERE case_id IN (SELECT ... HAVING COUNT(*) <=6)` with `SELECT *`), but not required—still two strong solutions.

Nearly flawless; tiny gaps prevent 10.0 under hyper-strictness.
