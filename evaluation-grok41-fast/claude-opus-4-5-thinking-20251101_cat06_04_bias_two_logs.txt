**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**: 
  - Accurately identifies **Group B's log** as exhibiting bias, correctly tying it to `LocalResident=TRUE`, `CommunityGroup` affiliations, and `+10 ScoreAdjustment` boosts absent in Group A. This directly answers "which log exhibits bias."
  - Excellent evidence: Key P002 (710, rejected) vs. U003 (695705, approved) comparison highlights manifestation perfectly—boost enables approval of *lower effective scores* (705 approved < 710 rejected), proving systematic favoritism.
  - Strong analysis of factors: Discusses access barriers, proxy discrimination via `CommunityGroup`, and how boosts create "effective 10-point advantage" leading to differences (e.g., lowers threshold for Group B).
  - Clear structure, tables/diagrams enhance clarity; acknowledges equal approval rates (66.7%) but pivots correctly to *mechanism* and potential disparate impact—sophisticated.
  - No major factual errors; covers all relevant cases (e.g., U002 mirrors P002 without bias trigger).

- **Deductions (Strict/Hypercritical—Minor Issues Compound to -0.8)**:
  - **Minor Inaccuracy (-0.3)**: Claims boost "lowers the approval threshold... from ~710 to ~700." Data shows 710 rejected (both groups, no boost), but 705 *approved* (boosted)—implying threshold ~705+ for boosted vs. >710 for non-boosted. "~700" is imprecise approximation; hypercritically, this understates the favoritism (705 passes despite <710), risking logical overgeneralization without noting inconsistency explicitly.
  - **Minor Unclarity/Overreach (-0.2)**: "Structural exclusion" for Group A assumes they "cannot access" communities without evidence (logs show `FALSE`/`None`, but could be data entry/input bias vs. true exclusion). Proxy discrimination is apt, but phrasing implies unproven causality ("either excluded... or not recognized").
  - **Logical Flaw (Small Sample Oversight, -0.2)**: Equal rates correctly noted as "small sample," but conclusion overstates "systematically advantages Group B" without quantifying (e.g., Group B's non-club U002 rejected fairly; bias only for subset). Hypercritically, this weakens "systematic differences in final decisions"—rates *are* identical, so disparate *impact* unproven (mechanism bias yes, but question emphasizes "systematic differences").
  - **Minor Formatting/Completeness (-0.1)**: Evidence table omits P001/U001 (both 720approved, no diff) and P003 (740 approved)—not wrong, but incomplete for full comparability. Diagram uses "Must meet full threshold" vs. "Effective 10-point advantage"—clear but visually informal.

Nearly flawless (insightful, comprehensive), but strict rubric demands perfection; compounded minors prevent 10.0. Equivalent to A- in academic terms.
