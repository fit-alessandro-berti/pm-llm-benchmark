**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Statements/Conclusions Only)
- **Anomaly Identification (Partial Credit, Significant Deduction):** Final solution correctly flags two key sequencing anomalies (shipment before checks; payment before invoice), aligning with cases 1002 and 1004. However, critically incomplete: ignores missing mandatory steps (e.g., no 'Validate Stock' in 1003/1004; no 'Perform Credit Check' in 1004), illogical intra-shipment ordering (e.g., 'Ship Goods' before 'Confirm Shipment' in 1003), and flags like `shipment_scheduled=N` despite shipping (1004) or `late_confirmation=Y` (1003). These are clear undesirable behaviors per normal flow, yet unaddressed—major logical flaw, reducing score sharply.
  
- **Hypotheses on Causes (No Credit):** Prompt explicitly requires hypothesizing causes (e.g., system errors, policy violations, training issues). Final solution entirely omits this; conclusion vaguely implies "train staff" but provides no explicit hypotheses tied to anomalies (e.g., no link to resource roles, order_type=priority in 1002, or `credit_score=650` risks). Fails core requirement.

- **SQL Queries (Strong but Imperfect, Moderate Deduction):** Queries are PostgreSQL-valid, relevant, and well-explained; effectively use `order_event_log` + `orders` for frequency/resources/order_type investigation. Excellent structure (counting, grouping, subqueries). Flaws: (1) "Shipment before checks" misses skipped-check cases (e.g., 1003/1004 won't trigger EXISTS if no check exists at all); (2) No coverage for missing activities, specific ship-before-confirm, or `resources` table (e.g., JOIN for department/role patterns to test training/policy hypotheses); (3) Sloppy aliasing (e.g., unqualified `order_event_log.case_id` in subqueries risks ambiguity/maintainability, though syntactically ok). No timing/delay queries despite implied need. Comprehensive but not exhaustive—penalized.

- **Overall Structure/Conclusion (Good):** Clear approach, modular queries, actionable insights. Conclusion ties back logically but lacks depth (no risk quantification, e.g., payment success post-anomaly).

**Nearly flawless would require: full anomaly coverage (incl. misses/skips), explicit hypotheses per anomaly, queries probing causes (e.g., missing-activity detection, `resources` joins, additional_info parsing), flawless SQL style. Deductions for incompleteness/gaps total ~2.8 points from 10.**
