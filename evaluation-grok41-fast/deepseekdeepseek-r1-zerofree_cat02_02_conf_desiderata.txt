**6.0**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Boxed Conclusions Only):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies no normative violations for Cases 1 and 3. Correctly identifies Risk Assessment before Credit Check and Finalize Documentation after rejection as normative violations for Case 2. Correctly identifies timing violations for Case 3 desiderata and no Follow-up Call for all cases.
- **Major flaws/incompletenesses (severe penalties)**:
  1. **Inaccuracy on Case 2 normative violations**: Fails to identify the missing "Inform Applicant" as a normative violation (strictly required after every Loan Decision per sequence and "must be informed"; log skips it entirely, violating "no skipping steps" and ordering rule "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision"). Lists only 2 violations instead of 3.
  2. **Logical flaw/misclassification**: Places missing "Inform Applicant" under Case 2 desiderata with hedging ("seems more like a normative rule violation"), which is incorrect—it's normative, not desiderata. Creates confusion and ambiguity.
  3. **Incomplete task fulfillment**: No performance of Task 3 (zero suggestions/interpretations/justifications for any case, e.g., no probe into Case 2 errors or Case 3 delays like potential weekends/holidays).
  4. **Missing required clarification for Task 2**: Does not "clarify that while these deviations are not severe, they represent suboptimal behavior" anywhere—just lists violations without context.
  5. **Lack of explanations**: Task 1 requires "explain the reasons"; boxed lists violations bullet-style with minimal phrasing (e.g., no timestamp references or why violations break specific rules). Task 2 lacks detail on how timings were calculated.
  6. **Unclear/incomplete structure**: Boxed covers Tasks 1-2 partially but abruptly ends; ignores Case 2 desiderata timings (Credit Check good within ~1h20m, but unmentioned); no holistic summary.
- **Overall**: ~70% accurate on core identifications but undermined by key omission, misclassification, missing task, and no clarifications/explanations. Not "nearly flawless"—multiple logical gaps prevent >6.0 under strict criteria.
