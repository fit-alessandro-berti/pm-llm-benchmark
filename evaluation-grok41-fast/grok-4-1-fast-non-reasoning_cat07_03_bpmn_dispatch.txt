**9.5**

### Reasoning for Grade
- **Accuracy (9.8/10)**: Nearly perfect tracing of flows, shapes, decisions, branches, and loops (e.g., Inventory OK? No  loop back; Payment OK? paths; More Time? retry). Correctly identifies swimlanes, main sequence (Start  place order  inventory  prepare  sales order  payment entry  validations), and elements like User Portal connections, Package Order self-loop, Contact Customer. Minor inferences (e.g., "Order Processing" from partial label, "Payment Gate?" for "Package Order") are transparently noted and don't mislead; no major factual errors.
- **Completeness (9.7/10)**: Covers ~95% of visible elements (all major labels, arrows, endpoints, parallels/loops). Misses tiny details like exact "Ship Order" partial (if present) or precise arrow crossings (e.g., Yes from Payment OK? to Place Order), but captures essence fully.
- **Clarity & Structure (9.9/10)**: Exemplary—overview, numbered steps, key features summary, BPMN context. Readable, professional, insightful (fault-tolerant process notes).
- **Depth/Insight (9.4/10)**: Goes beyond description to analyze logic (parallel paths, retries), business purpose, and offers extensions (BPMN export).

Deduction only for slight flow ambiguities in lower section (e.g., exact Package Order  Contact Customer linkage) due to diagram crowding/partials—still outstanding for a visual parse.
