### Evaluation Rationale (for transparency, not part of graded response)
- **Strengths (near-flawless aspects):** Perfect structure matching prompt (anomalies, hypotheses, queries). Anomalies precisely identified with correct references to model values. Hypotheses insightful, directly tied to anomalies, and align with prompt examples (automation, delays, skipping, bottlenecks). Queries are PostgreSQL-correct, use EXTRACT(EPOCH) properly, target all key anomalies (R-P outliers, P-N by groups, A-C short, E-N skipping/missing P, E-N by type/amount), correlate with claim_type, amounts, adjusters/regions/resources as prompted, and identify specific claims/patterns effectively.
- **Minor inaccuracies penalized strictly (deducting 0.8 total):**
  - Query 1: OVER() windows compute AVG/STDEV on *filtered outliers only*, distorting displayed "global" stats (should use CTE/subquery for true globals). Filtering logic correct via subquery.
  - All queries: No per-claim aggregation (e.g., MIN(timestamp) per activity); cartesian pairs if >1 event/activity/claim (unlikely per process but unhandled, logical gap).
  - Query 2: Assumes `resource = adjuster.name` exactly (VARCHAR match plausible but unverified vs. adjuster_id); correlates P's resource (not necessarily assigned from 'A').
- No major flaws (e.g., syntax errors, wrong joins, missing coverage); corrections not needed. Hypotheses/SQL independent, no instruction refs. Hypercritical but awards high for comprehensive, targeted excellence.
