The provided answer is correct, complete, and optimal. The CTE-based query precisely identifies `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then joins to retrieve exactly the original events (via `SELECT e.*`) from those cases without extraneous columns. The `ORDER BY` enhances usability without altering correctness. It fully matches the requirements with no inaccuracies, inefficiencies, or ambiguities.
