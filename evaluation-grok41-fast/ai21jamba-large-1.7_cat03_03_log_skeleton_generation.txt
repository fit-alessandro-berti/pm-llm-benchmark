**2.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Summary:
- **Structural/Syntactic Issues (deducts ~1.5 points)**: The dictionary format is mostly correct (sets of tuples for constraints, dict of sets for `activ_freq`), and it uses consistent full activity names. However, inline comments inside set literals (e.g., equivalence) are sloppy and could cause parsing issues in strict linters; minor but unnecessary. All activities from scenario are covered in `activ_freq` (+minor credit). No syntax errors preventing execution.
  
- **Semantic Inaccuracies in Constraints (deducts ~4.0 points)**: 
  - **equivalence**: Arbitrary/single pair (QC, PO); equivalence requires symmetric occurrences, but only one direction provided (def implies directed, but logically symmetric pairs needed). No justification for why only these (e.g., RO/CA/D also fixed at 1). Weak fit to scenario.
  - **always_before**: Completely reversed logic. Def: "if first occurs, second previously" (i.e., second << first). Examples like (CA, RI) wrongly imply RI before CA; actual process is CA << RI. All three pairs inverted and illogical (e.g., QC requires GSL before? No). Zero correct.
  - **always_after**: Partially correct directions (e.g., (PI, QC), (IC, RP)), but incomplete (missing RO << CA, QC << PO/GSL/D, etc.) and arbitrary (why these?). Def phrasing "in one of the following events" is awkwardly matched but ok.
  - **never_together**: Fundamentally wrong—pairs are activities that *must* co-occur in successful cases (QC/PO sequential; RI/PI sequential). Def: "cannot co-exist in same case." Comments nonsensical ("already ordered"; "without confirmation"—they co-occur *with* confirmation). Zero correct.
  - **activ_freq**: Inconsistent with process logic. Mid-process activities (PI/QC/PO/GSL/D) have no {0} despite skippable paths (e.g., no stock after CA  no RI/PI/QC/etc.). {1,2} for CA/PI arbitrary/unjustified (scenario implies linear/single per order). RI/IC/RP {0,1} ok, RO/D {1} ok, but overall flawed bounds.
  - **directly_follows**: Some plausible (ROCA, PIQC, etc.), but invalidates on conditionals (CA not always RI if unavailable; constraint "if first occurs, second immediately after" fails). Missing key ones (POGSL?). Overly rigid for branched process.

- **Explanation Flaws (deducts ~1.5 points)**: Misstates constraints (always_after example claims "GSL after Dispatch"—opposite of code; never_together claims non-coexistence for co-occurring activities). Vague ("some activities"); doesn't justify choices vs. scenario. Equivalence comment ok but trivial.

- **Logical/Completeness Gaps (deducts ~1.0 points)**: Fails to model core process flow (no RO start; no branching for availability; IC/RP detached but possibly parallel/post-D; no end constraints). Includes invalid/skippable direct follows. Not a faithful "representation" of scenario—more invented than derived. Arbitrary choices (e.g., {1,2}) without basis.

Overall: Format salvageable (baseline ~3), but rampant logical errors, reversals, and process mismatches make it unusable/misleading. Far from "nearly flawless"—equivalent to guessing with errors.
