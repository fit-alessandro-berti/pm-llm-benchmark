**2.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Task 1 (Identify long cases)**: **Major failure**. Total times are catastrophically inaccurate—ignores multi-day spans (e.g., Case 102 ends 03-02 09:15 25h; Case 104 ends 03-02 08:30 24h; Case 105 ends 03-03 09:30 49h). Treats all as same-day, fabricating times (e.g., Case 102 as "5h5m" using wrong end timestamp 14:00). Only identifies Case 105 (ironically longest but misses 102/104 as comparably extreme vs. short cases 101/103 at ~2h/1.2h). Claims "no other case has significantly longer"—logically false even under its own flawed calcs (310m/240m/135m are not trivial). Table presented as fact is erroneous.
- **Task 2 (Root causes)**: **Inaccurate and unclear**. Correctly notes escalations (only in 102/105, not 101/103/104 as claimed). Misstates details (e.g., Case 102 "escalation at 14:00"—actual 11:30; Case 104 "investigation 09:00-13:00 takes 4h"—timestamps are event times, not durations; Case 105 "delay assignment-investigation 4h"—actual ~35m, and post-escalation spans days). Fails to quantify/spot real delays (e.g., post-escalation waits: 102 waits ~19h post-escalate; 105 ~47h post-escalate; 104 unexplained ~19h assign-to-resolve gap).
- **Task 3 (Explain + recommend)**: **Vague, generic, incomplete**. Explanations tautological ("escalations take time  longer time"). No quantitative links to cycle times (e.g., escalations add ~20-45h). Recommendations boilerplate ("optimize processes," "monitor delays")—lacks specifics (e.g., train L1 agents, auto-escalate criteria, SLAs). No insights like "escalations correlate perfectly with long cases" or "non-escalated 104 still delayed  agent workload?"
- **Overall**: Well-structured but content is ~70% wrong/incomplete. Ignores date changes (fatal for time analysis). Minor clarity issues (e.g., inconsistent min/h formats). No credit for <think> corrections (per instructions). Barely passes as "attempt" (structure + partial escalation nod); flawless requires perfect math/IDs/nuanced analysis.
