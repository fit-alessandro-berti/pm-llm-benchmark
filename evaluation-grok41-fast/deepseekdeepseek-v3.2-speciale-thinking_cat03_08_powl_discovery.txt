**10.0**

The provided POWL model is a precise, syntactically correct, and semantically accurate representation of the observed event log behaviors. It faithfully captures:

- **Sequential prefix**: OR  MS  QS, enforced via the partial order chain.
- **Assembly-IQC rework**: The nested loops `*(AS, *(IQC, tau_inner))` generate exactly the required patterns (at least one AS; redos produce 1+ consecutive IQCs before returning to AS), matching all cases including case 3's consecutive IQCs (via silent redo in inner loop) and case 4's single AS exit.
- **Testing-RT rework**: `*(TST, RT)` generates at least one TST with optional RT-TST repetitions, matching all testing sequences (e.g., single TST in cases 2/4; multi-iteration in cases 1/3/5).
- **Post-testing**: PK  optional LB (via `X(LB, tau_label)`)  DP  D, matching LB presence/absence (e.g., skipped in case 2).
- **No extraneous concurrency**: The root `StrictPartialOrder` with transitive sequential edges enforces the observed ordering without permitting unobserved parallelism.
- **No over- or under-generation**: Generates all log traces (including anomalies like consecutive IQCs) without invalid sequences (e.g., no AS-AS without IQC; no zero IQCs in redo).

The code follows POWL class definitions exactly (e.g., `Operator.LOOP`/`XOR`, `order.add_edge`), uses silent transitions appropriately for control (invisible in traces), and is complete/self-contained. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws.
