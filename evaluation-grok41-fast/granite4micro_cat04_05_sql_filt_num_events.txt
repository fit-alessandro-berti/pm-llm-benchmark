**6.0**

### Critical Evaluation
- **Major flaw: Incomplete column selection**. The inner query explicitly selects only `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp` (plus the added `event_count`), omitting *any other columns* the table might have (prompt specifies "at least" these columns, implying potential extras). This fails to return the "full set of events," as rows lose data. A flawless query uses `SELECT *` in a structure preserving all columns (e.g., via CTE with `GROUP BY`/`HAVING` and `JOIN`).
- **Major flaw: Extraneous output column**. The result includes `event_count`, altering every returned row. The task demands the original "full set of events" for qualifying cases—no additions.
- **Major flaw: Incorrect explanation**. Claims the inner query "selects all columns from `event_log`"—false, as code lists only three. Also misdescribes filtering as "within the subquery," when `WHERE` is *outer* (subquery computes counts for *all* rows first).
- **Minor flaw: Unclear/awkward phrasing**. Explanation's "Filtering in Subquery: ... directly within the subquery (`subquery`)" is confusing/misleading, as no filtering occurs inside the subquery definition.
- **Strengths (insufficient for higher score)**: Core logic sound (window function correctly partitions and filters entire cases). Efficient enough for DuckDB. Returns *correct rows* (if ignoring column issues).

Not nearly flawless—multiple logical inaccuracies and incomplete output justify mid-range score under hypercritical standards. A 9-10 requires exact column fidelity, no extras, precise explanation, and general robustness.
