**10.0**

The provided SQL query fully and correctly satisfies all requirements with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. It precisely identifies cases containing at least one instance of the exact sequence ('Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order') in direct succession (via ordered timestamps and NOT EXISTS subqueries ensuring no intervening events), further filters those by >5 days elapsed between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' (using julianday, valid in DuckDB for datetime columns), collects such `case_id`s distinctly in the CTE, and excludes all events from those cases in the main query via NOT IN. The result returns exactly the required events from non-matching cases, with sensible ORDER BY. Edge cases (e.g., multiple sequences per case, empty exclusion set) are handled correctly. The explanation is accurate and supplementary. Assumptions (unique/increasing timestamps) are appropriately noted without impacting correctness. No penalties apply.
