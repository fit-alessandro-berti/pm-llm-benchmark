**6.0**

### Explanation of Grade (for transparency, not part of response)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: Excellent structure matching all tasks (1,2,3). Correctly identifies Case 2 as normative violator and Case 3 as desiderata failure (Case 1 clean). Clear explanations, good clarifications on severity, reasonable justifications aligned with prompt, helpful summary table.
- **Fatal flaws (strict deductions)**: 
  - **Major inaccuracy in Task 1**: Case 2 completely skips "Inform Applicant" (required after every Loan Decision per normative sequence and "must be informed of the outcome"). This is a clear "skipping activities" violation, yet unmentioned in reasons, justifications, or table. Only 2/3 key violations listed—logically incomplete and overlooks strict rule.
  - **Minor inaccuracies**: Case 3 timings overstated as exactly "48 hours" (Credit Check ~49h, Inform ~51h), slightly misstating deltas while claiming exceedance.
- **Overall**: Comprehensive and professional, but core task (full reasons for violations) flawed. Hypercritical lens demands deduction for inaccuracy (not "nearly flawless"); 6.0 balances quality with penalties.
