**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score):**
  - Correctly identifies core anomalies in both models: Model 1's lack of Interview  Decide ordering (allowing premature Decide); Model 2's Post  Interview (allowing Interview before Screen), Payroll skip, and unnecessary Onboard loop.
  - Accurate severity comparison: Model 2's flaws (e.g., Payroll optional, foundational order reversal) are more numerous and impact essential steps (payroll integrity, screening logic), while Model 1's is a single ordering flaw.
  - Conclusion correct and well-justified: Model 1 closer to normative (fewer deviations, all activities mandatory/correctly sequenced except one pair; retains payroll/onboarding chain perfectly).
  - Clear structure, logical flow, precise use of model elements (edges, operators), and ties anomalies to process logic (e.g., decision needs interviews, payroll essential).
  - No unclarities in conclusions; justification explains impact on "correctness and integrity."

- **Weaknesses (Penalized Significantly for Strictness):**
  - **Factual inaccuracy in Model 1 anomaly (major deduction -1.5):** Claims "skipping interviews entirely" with example path `Screen  Decide` omitting Interview. Incorrect—StrictPartialOrder requires **all nodes executed exactly once** in linear extensions (Interview always after Screen). Anomaly is **order violation** (Decide possibly before Interview), not skipping. Misrepresents model behavior, though essence (premature decision) is right.
  - **Minor inaccuracy/mislabeling (-0.3):** "Premature Onboarding" in Model 2—onboarding **is** correctly post-Decide; label wrong (though notes "correct" inline).
  - **Vague phrasing (-0.2):** "Logically recoverable" for Model 1 flaw—subjective/unprecise; model doesn't enforce correct order.
  - **Minor omission (-0.1):** Model 1 allows Interview **after** Decide (also illogical); Model 2's Screen as "dangling" (post-Post, executable post-Close).

- **Overall:** Nearly flawless in conclusion/task fulfillment (90%+ alignment), but inaccuracy on partial order semantics prevents 9+ (strict rule: "any inaccuracies... significantly lower"). Equivalent to A- paper: sound but with provable error.
