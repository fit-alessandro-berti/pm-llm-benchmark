**10.0**

The query is flawless. It correctly uses a CTE to identify `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via proper `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then accurately joins back to retrieve all events (`e.*`) for those cases only, excluding others entirely. The `INNER JOIN` ensures no extraneous rows. The `ORDER BY e.case_id, e."timestamp"` is a logical enhancement for event log readability (grouping cases then sequencing events chronologically) without altering the required result set, and quoting `"timestamp"` is precise for identifier safety in DuckDB. No inaccuracies, inefficiencies, unclarities, or flaws; fully matches the spec.
