**3.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Major Execution Failure (Fatal)**: The code does not run without errors. `petri_utils.remove_arc_from_to(p_FC_ready, t_FC, net)` does not exist in `pm4py` (utils provide `add_arc_from_to` but removal requires manual arc lookup and `net.arcs.remove(arc)`). Runtime `AttributeError`. Invalid as a "self-contained Python snippet".
- **Major Logical/Structural Flaws in FC Loop (Core Scenario Requirement Broken)**:
  - `t_FC` has dual outputs: `t_FC  p_FC_ready` (wrong, added first) *and* `t_FC  p_FC_done` (added later). Firing `t_FC` splits tokens to both places, violating single-path semantics. Cannot model "FC raises doubts  II loop" or "proceed to CA".
  - Loop input `p_FC_ready  t_FC` added then removed (even if removal worked, breaks re-fire of `t_FC` after `t_II`).
  - First firing (from `p_DV_done  t_FC`): tokens duplicate to `p_FC_ready` *and* `p_FC_done`. `p_FC_ready` stuck (post-removal no output except attempted self-loop). Cannot reach `p_end` without nondeterminism/ deadlock. Fails "multiple II before CA".
  - Scenario demands FC  (optional multiple II  FC)  CA. Implemented net deadlocks/splits; unfaithful.
- **Unclarities and Poor Code Quality**:
  - Messy inline comments mid-arc adds ("note: ... remove this duplicate", "# Actually ... fix that") acknowledge errors but apply botched "fixes" that worsen issues. Code reads as unfinished/debug draft, not production-ready.
  - No error handling; assumes nonexistent API.
  - Redundant/wrong place usage: `p_FC_ready` wired as bogus intermediate, not clean loop entry/exit.
- **Minor Positives (Preventing <3.0)**:
  - DV/RDS loop correct: `p_DV_ready  t_DV  p_DV_done  t_RDS`, with exit `p_DV_done  t_FC`. Models re-submission properly.
  - Linear tail (CAAPPNCLp_end) correct.
  - Start/CR/DV entry correct (`p_start  t_CR  p_DV_ready`).
  - Places/transitions/labels/im/fm syntactically valid where added.
  - Explanation intent matches scenario (describes correct structure), but code doesn't deliver.
- **Other Inaccuracies**:
  - No modeling of AP conditionality ("if surpasses threshold")—sequential assumes always AP (minor simplification ok, but unaddressed).
  - Typos in explanation: "indepth"  "in-depth"; "CKA"  "CA"; "insuranceclaim" no space.
  - No `source/sink` removal example followed; minor.

Overall: Intent ~70% correct (DV/sequence good), but implementation ~30% functional (FC broken, doesn't execute, wrong behavior). Major flaws dominate; not "nearly flawless." Equivalent to half-working code.
