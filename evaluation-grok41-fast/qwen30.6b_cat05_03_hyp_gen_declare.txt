**2.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Output Only)
- **Anomalies (Major Failures):** Completely inaccurate. (1) Misinterprets "precedence(C, R)" as creating a contradiction for closing without evaluation; this rule aligns with intended flow (R before C) and is not anomalous. (2) Fabricates nonexistent "noncoexistence" between E and N (model specifies E and C); wrongly claims the rule says they "can coexist" when it forbids coexistence. Ignores core contradiction: existence(C)=1.0 + responded_existence(AE) + noncoexistence(E,C)=1.0 makes full flow impossible (A triggers E, blocking required C). No recognition of undermined logic (e.g., no enforcement of full chain RAEPNC). Undermines business intent entirely.
- **Hypotheses (Partial Credit, but Flawed):** Superficially echoes prompt examples (misinterpretation, policy changes, technical issues) but ties to incorrect anomalies (e.g., "closed without evaluation" contradicts model's noncoexistence allowing C only if no E). Vague, non-specific to model (ignores AE forcing E, clashing with C requirement). Misses key hypotheses like data-driven errors in DECLARE mining.
- **SQL Verification (Catastrophic Failures):** All queries invalid/malformed/useless:
  1. No join (claims lacks `activity`/`event_id`); contradictory `WHERE` (`activity='C' AND activity NOT IN ('E','N')` impossible); ignores grouping by `claim_id`.
  2. Impossible `WHERE` (`IN('E','N') AND ='C'`); no per-claim check for coexistence (needs `GROUP BY claim_id HAVING COUNT(CASE activity='E')>0 AND COUNT(CASE activity='C')>0`).
  3. Tautological (`IN('E','A') AND ('E' OR 'A')` selects all E/A events); no correlation check (e.g., `EXISTS A before E per claim_id`); ignores `adjusters` table.
- **Overall:** Structure present, but content riddled with factual errors, logical flaws, and broken SQL. No accurate anomaly detection, no valid verification. Far from "nearly flawless"—strictly 2.0 for minimal structure/effort.
