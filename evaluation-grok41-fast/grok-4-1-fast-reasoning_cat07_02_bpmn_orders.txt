**9.7/10.0**

### Rationale
- **Accuracy (9.8/10)**: Exceptionally precise breakdown of the 4-panel structure, symbols (e.g., circles, rectangles, diamonds, cylinders), flows, loops, decisions, and labels. Matches the image almost perfectly, including partial/obscured text like "Training", "Draft order", "Manual Consumption Subprocess", "Product consume", and DBs ("Customers", "Raw materials"). Minor inferences (e.g., Panel 2's implied "Products" DB) are reasonable given symmetry and image clarity.
- **Completeness (9.9/10)**: Covers every major element, interconnections, and vertical hierarchy. No omissions; even subtle loops/feedback arrows are noted.
- **Clarity & Structure (10/10)**: Well-organized (overview  panel-by-panel  themes), readable, professional. Uses consistent formatting for flows.
- **Insight (9.5/10)**: Strong analysis of purpose (ERP/MRP pipeline), patterns ("Check/Add" validation), and context (manufacturing/supply chain). Slight deduction for speculative interconnections ("subtly span panels") as they're not explicit, but enhances value.
- **Deductions**: Tiny over-guesses on a few partial labels (e.g., "Draft product" in Panel 2 is closer to "Draft" fragment) and "Manufacturer" phrasing, but negligible impact.

This is an outstanding response—detailed enough for reproduction, concise yet comprehensive.
