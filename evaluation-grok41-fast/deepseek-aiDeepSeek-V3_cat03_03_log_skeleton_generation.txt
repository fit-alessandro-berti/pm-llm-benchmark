**2.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation:
- **Fundamental Misunderstanding of Constraints (Score-Killing Errors)**:
  - **Always Before/After Completely Reversed**: Definitions are clear—"Always Before: If the first occurs, second previously (before it)"; "Always After: If first occurs, second after." Answer inverts all pairs (e.g., `('CA', 'RI')` in always_before means if CA occurs, RI *before* CA—opposite of process. Same for entire chains and always_after reverses). This breaks the entire model logically. Explanation explicitly contradicts definitions (e.g., "'CA' must occur before 'RI'" but codes wrong direction).
  - **Never Together Absurd**: `('Receive Order', 'Dispatch')` prohibits co-occurrence in same case, but scenario demands both in every trace (start-to-end process). Explanation repeats this nonsense. Invalidates model.
  - **Incomplete Sequence**: Ignores RO (first activity). Chains start at CA, omitting ROCA. RO in `activ_freq` but unconstrained/orphaned.
  - **Arbitrary/Illogical Choices**: Equivalence only on GSL/D (unjustified; why not others in linear flow?). Directly-follows only two late pairs (ignores early direct flows like ROCA). No rationale ties to scenario.

- **Structural/Technical Flaws**:
  - Uses full names inconsistently (e.g., 'Generate Shipping Label' vs. prompt's **GSL** abbrevs like RO/CA). Prompt lists abbrevs prominently—sloppy, risks parser errors in real Log Skeleton tools.
  - `equivalence` tuple is one-way; definition implies bidirectional ("same occurrences"), but only one direction coded/explained.
  - `activ_freq` assumes all exactly {1} (mandatory unique), but scenario allows no zeros explicitly? Unjustified; e.g., RP might be {0,1} if payment fails. All-or-nothing ignores variability.

- **Presentation/Completeness Issues**:
  - Intro: "an *example* of how... might look"—admits non-definitive, undermining task ("Construct... for the scenario").
  - Explanation repeats code errors (e.g., describes correct intent but codes wrong).
  - No handling of potential parallels (e.g., IC post-D but payment async?); linear assumption overconstrains.
  - Missing activities in some constraints (e.g., no RO pairs except wrong never_together).

- **Minor but Deductible**:
  - Syntax ok, but sets use `{tuple}` (fine), comments redundant.
  - No validation against full 10 activities in all constraints.

Nearly zero logical fidelity to scenario despite correct skeleton keys. Structure alone earns minimal points; content is ~80% wrong/flawed. Flawless would need accurate directions, complete linear chain (e.g., always_before=[('RI','CA'), ('PI','RI'), ..., ('RP','IC')]), sensible freqs ({1} for most, {0,1} optional), empty/irrelevant for equivalence/never_together/directly_follows unless justified, using abbrevs. This fails hypercritically.
