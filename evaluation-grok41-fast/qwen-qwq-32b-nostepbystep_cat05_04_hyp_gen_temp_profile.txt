**6.0**

### Rationale for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (Supporting ~6.0 baseline):**
  - **Anomalies (Task 1):** Nearly flawless. Correctly identifies the 4 key anomalies (R-P low STDEV, P-N long/high-var delay, A-C quick implying skips, E-N quick implying bypass). Descriptions precise, tied to model values/process steps. No extras or misses.
  - **Hypotheses (Task 2):** Excellent. 2-3 plausible, specific hypotheses per anomaly (e.g., auto-approval, batching, mislabeling). Directly linked to business logic/data issues. Creative yet grounded.
  - **Structure/Presentation:** Perfectly independent, clear sections, no meta-references. Key Insights add value without fluff.
  - **Verification Approach (Task 3 overall):** Good intent—targets specific claims outside ranges, checks skips (sequence/intermediates), correlates with adjusters/resources/claim_ids as prompted. Covers all prompt examples (e.g., immediate closure, long P-N, adjusters).

- **Fatal Flaws (Heavy Deduction from 10.0 to 6.0):**
  - **SQL Inaccuracies/Errors (Dominant Issue—~40% weight as core task):** Multiple non-executable/buggy queries undermine verification utility. Hypercritical penalties:
    | Query | Issues |
    |-------|--------|
    | 1 (R-P) | Threshold wrong: Uses 24h (±10min=~23.8-24.2h) vs model 90k s (~25h). Misses low-STDEV verification (e.g., no Z-score/aggregate stats). Unclear "duration_diff" utility. |
    | 2 (P-N) | `EXTRACT(DAY FROM ...)` imprecise (truncates, ignores hours/mins; e.g., 6.9 days=6). Better: `EXTRACT(EPOCH)/86400 >7`. Minor: `p_time < n_time` redundant if MAX assumes order. |
    | **3 (A-C)** | **Major syntax/logic errors:** `WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - a_time) < 7200`—missing `)` (won't parse). `intermediate_steps <3`—unavailable in WHERE (correlated SELECT alias not scoped; needs CTE/HAVING/nested). Counts **all** E/P/N per claim (ignores A-C timestamps; no `BETWEEN a_time AND close_time` as hinted in think). Fundamentally verifies wrong thing. |
    | 4 (E-N) | Solid (catches missing/out-of-order P). Minor: `p_time > n_time` assumes MAX; better explicit order check. |
    | **5 (Correlator)** | **Critical logic error:** IN-subquery references undefined `n_time`, `p_time`, `close_time`, `a_time` (no inner subquery/CTE). Won't execute. Vague anomaly filter (e.g., activity='P' but checks C-duration?). JOIN assumption ok but unverified (resource=adjuster.name?). |
  - **Overall SQL:** 3/5 broken/unreliable  fails "propose verification methods using SQL queries." No ZETA/threshold rigor (e.g., AVG±3*STDEV). No joins to `claims`/`adjusters` for types/regions/customers as prompted. No aggregate stats (e.g., compute real AVG/STDEV to validate model).
  - **Minor/Unclear:** Typos (e.g., "R  P" spacing, "c.close_time" alias ok but inconsistent casing). Q3 `FROM (...) c` then `c.claim_id`—works but `intermediate_steps` subquery inefficient/repeats scan.

- **Why Not Lower (e.g., 4.0)?** Ideas/approaches conceptually strong (e.g., step counts, sequence checks, correlations); fixes possible with minor rewrites. Covers prompt breadth.
- **Why Not Higher (e.g., 8.0)?** SQL bugs are "inaccuracies/logical flaws"—not "nearly flawless." Strict rubric demands executable, precise queries; these fail core verification goal.
