**1.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Major logical flaws in loop modeling (critical failure, -4.0 penalty)**: `loopAS = *(AS, IQC)` placed unconditionally after `AS -> loopAS -> TST`. POWL loop `*(A, B)` *always* executes A at least once upon entry. Case 4 trace: `AS -> TST` (single AS, no IQC). Model forces extra AS via loopAS, producing invalid trace `AS -> AS -> ... -> TST`. Similarly, `loopTST = *(TST, RT)` after `TST -> loopTST -> PK` forces extra TST in non-rework cases (e.g., case 2: single `TST -> PK`), mismatching traces. Loops cannot be optional/skippable as structured; requires choice before loop entry (unmodeled).
- **Broken flow for optional LB (-2.5 penalty)**: `XOR(LB, silent)` with edges `PK -> XOR -> LB`, `XOR -> silent`, `LB -> DP`. No `silent -> DP` edge. Silent path dead-ends (no progression to `DP -> D`), invalidating skip traces (case 2). XOR children listed redundantly (XOR node + separate LB/silent in nodes list creates ambiguity/duplication).
- **Inaccurate trace coverage (-1.5 penalty)**: Fails case 4 (skips IQC/RT/AS-multiples entirely); forces iterations not present. Case 3/5 multi-IQC/AS/RT partially fit but with extra executions due to pre-loop activities. No concurrency modeled (all forced sequential except broken XOR); unconnected nodes claimed but edges enforce total order.
- **Structural/clarity issues (-0.5 penalty)**: Nodes list includes raw `AS`, `IQC`, etc., *plus* loop children referencing them (shared references ok in POWL, but leads to over-execution). Explanation claims "concurrency and parallelism" at XOR (false; XOR is exclusive choice, not parallel). "AS -> IQC -> AS" loop description mismatches POWL semantics exactly.
- **Minor positives (+0.5 credit)**: Correctly identifies need for loops/choice/PO; uses valid POWL classes/operators; sequential prefix `OR -> MS -> QS -> AS` accurate.

Nearly zero fidelity to traces; model generates invalid executions. Only minimal conceptual intent prevents 1.0.
