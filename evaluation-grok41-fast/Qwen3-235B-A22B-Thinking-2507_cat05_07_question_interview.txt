**10.0**

The provided answer delivers a precisely targeted list of 10 open-ended questions that comprehensively address the prompt's requirements: uncovering missing details (e.g., Q1, Q6), decision criteria (e.g., Q2, Q5, Q9), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q2, Q3, Q8), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q4, Q10), and exception handling (e.g., Q1, Q3, Q6, Q8). Each question directly references and builds on ambiguities in the process description (e.g., "sometimes hiring contractors," "can become more complex," "potential exceptions") without introducing hypotheticals that stray from the narrative or requesting prohibited implementation details (no tools, databases, or tech specifics beyond conceptual process flow). All are phrased with "what," "how," or "walk me through" for maximal openness, ensuring rich responses. Coverage spans every major stage (documentation, assignment, inspection, marketing, screening, audits, handoffs) with no gaps or redundancies. The supplementary "Why these questions work" section reinforces alignment without adding fluff or flaws. No inaccuracies, logical errors, unclarities, or even minor deviations—flawless execution.
