**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**:
  - **Comprehensive reasoning**: Clearly documents matching criteria (order_id + timing + semantics), tolerance application, standardization (Log A names as primary), timestamp selection (Log A primary + B noted), attribute merging (all fields from both, no losses), non-matches (Quality Check and Delivery correctly isolated with "Source"), and chronological ordering (correct by primary TS: 10:00  10:01:30  10:02  10:03  10:05  10:20).
  - **All events included/enriched**: No discards; merged events have unified format with B's rich attributes (user_id, resource_id, notes); standalones retain origins and available data without fabrication.
  - **Output format**: Chronological list with consistent fields, explicit merge notes (e.g., tolerances, discrepancies), readable unified structure – directly fulfills "single, integrated event log" requirement.
  - **Handles requirements precisely**: Primary timeline (Log A), slight offsets addressed, conflicts resolved transparently (none major), semantic mappings logical (e.g., "OrderReceived"  "Order Received").

- **Flaws/Deductions (strict penalties)**:
  - **Payment event merge (major logical flaw, -0.5)**: Timestamps differ by exactly 5s (10:02:00Z vs. 10:02:05Z), explicitly exceeding the prompt's "<2 seconds" tolerance example ("small timestamp tolerance... less than 2 seconds"). Answer acknowledges "exceeding" but overrides via semantics/notes/assumption ("no other payment events"), violating "if you cannot confidently match... leave them separate." Defensible in context ("slightly offset by a few seconds"), but hypercritically, this is not "confident" per strict tolerance rule – should have left separate (would still order chronologically).
  - **2-second tolerance stretches (minor inaccuracies, -0.2 each, total -0.4)**:
    - Order Received: Exactly 2s (10:00:00Z - 09:59:58Z); prompt specifies *less than* 2s, but labeled "within tolerance."
    - Item Shipped: Exactly 2s (10:05:02Z - 10:05:00Z); same issue.
    - Explicit misstatement compounds (strictly not "<2s"), though pragmatically close and justified.
  - **Minor unclarities (-0.1)**: Event names for standalones not "standardized" (e.g., "Quality Check" kept as-is; fine per rules, but reasoning implies Log A standardization universally). Prose-list format slightly less tabular than ideal for "event log," but functional.

Nearly flawless overall (excellent coverage, no missing events/data, strong documentation), but explicit rule overrides and precise tolerance misalignments prevent 10.0 under hypercritical lens. Equivalent to A- work.
