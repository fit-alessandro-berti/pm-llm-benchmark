**10.0**

The answer is exemplary: fully accurate, comprehensive, logically sound, and directly aligned with the normative description. It correctly identifies violations in Cases 2, 3, and 5 (with precise explanations and relevant quotes), deems Cases 1 and 4 compliant, and resolves any interpretive nuances (e.g., Case 3's hybrid path and Case 5's missing step) without overreaching. Structure is clear, evidence-based, and free of ambiguities, flaws, or extraneous content. The summary table reinforces findings without errors. No deductions warranted under hypercritical scrutiny.
