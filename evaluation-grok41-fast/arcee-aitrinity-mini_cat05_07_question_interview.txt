**10.0**

The provided answer delivers a precise, comprehensive list of 10 open-ended questions that flawlessly target the prompt's requirements. Each question directly probes key gaps in the described process—such as sequencing (Q1, Q5, Q10), decision criteria (Q2, Q3), roles/responsibilities (Q4), timing (Q5), exceptions/escalations (Q6), and additional clarifiers like communication (Q7), scalability (Q8), handoffs (Q9)—without any deviation into prohibited areas like SQL or implementation. Questions are conceptually focused, interviewer-natural (e.g., "Could you walk me through...", "elaborate on..."), and systematically cover the process lifecycle from docs to post-lease. Formatting enhances usability with categories and intent notes, but these do not detract. No inaccuracies, redundancies, logical flaws, or unclarities; it is exhaustive yet concise, achieving perfect alignment and depth.
