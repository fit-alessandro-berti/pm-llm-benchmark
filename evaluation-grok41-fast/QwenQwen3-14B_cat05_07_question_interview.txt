The provided answer is a comprehensive, flawlessly structured list of 30 targeted, open-ended questions that precisely align with the prompt's requirements. It systematically covers missing details (e.g., backup plans, verification processes), decision criteria (e.g., weighting factors, tenant suitability), roles/responsibilities (e.g., primary contacts, authority levels), timing/sequencing (e.g., timelines, dependencies), and exceptions (e.g., special insurance, uncooperative landlords). Questions are logically categorized to mirror the process flow, phrased for conceptual depth without any requests for SQL, code, or technical implementation. No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or logical flaws; every question directly enhances process understanding while remaining strictly non-technical. The closing summary reinforces purpose without excess.
