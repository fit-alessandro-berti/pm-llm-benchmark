**6.0**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting mid-range score)**: 
  - Anomalies precisely identified (e.g., premature shipments in 1002/1003/1004, payment/invoice reversal in 1004, post-shipment confirmation in 1003, missing validations in 1004), matching data exactly. Case 1001 correctly ignored as normal.
  - Hypotheses insightful, varied, and tied to anomalies (e.g., deadlines, fraud, system latency, data errors, policy violations). Covers human/system/policy causes as prompted.
  - Queries relevant to hypotheses, use all tables (`order_event_log`, `orders`, `resources`), PostgreSQL-valid syntax (CTEs, FILTER, LEFT JOINs, MAX(CASE)). Specific (e.g., timestamps, roles, values), not generic. Good purposes/explanations. Structure clear, professional.
  - Next steps logical extension.

- **Major Flaws (preventing >7.0; significant deductions for inaccuracies/logical errors)**:
  - **Query 4 (critical logic inversion)**: WHERE `ship.timestamp > confirm.timestamp` detects *normal* flow (ship after confirm), not the stated anomaly/purpose ("Shipment Confirmation *After* Goods Shipped", i.e., confirm > ship or ship < confirm). Fails on Case 1003 (09:10 < 09:45; query returns false). Undermines key anomaly investigation.
  - **Query 6 (critical aggregation error)**: `COUNT(*) AS total_orders` counts *total events* post-LEFT JOIN (e.g., ~7 per complete order), not orders. Yields nonsense (e.g., compliant order inflates "total" to 20+ if 3 orders). `COUNT(DISTINCT o.case_id)` needed. Hypothesis (high-value shortcuts) untestable as-is.
  - Incomplete coverage: No general missing-all-7-activities query (despite 1004 missing multiple); no duplicates/out-of-order beyond specifics (e.g., 1002's early Confirm Shipment). Query 1 misses pure-missing prereqs (e.g., 1003/1004 ship with absent stock/credit).
  - Minor unclarities: Query 1 assumes prereq exists post-ship (misses pure skips if no later event); Query 3 only critical validations (not full flow); Query 6 `ORDER BY o.order_value` after GROUP BY ok but trivial.

Nearly flawless requires *error-free* SQL + exhaustive coverage. Two fatal query bugs + gaps = mid-score despite excellent reasoning/structure.
