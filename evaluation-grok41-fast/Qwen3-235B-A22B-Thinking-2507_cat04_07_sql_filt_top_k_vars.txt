The provided answer is nearly flawless. The SQL query precisely meets all requirements:

- Correctly computes ordered sequences per `case_id` using `STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp)` in `case_variants`.
- Groups by variant, counts cases via `COUNT(*)` in `top_variants`, and selects top K via `ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT K`.
- Filters to return exactly the events (`el.*`) from cases in top K variants using efficient JOINs, excluding all others.
- DuckDB syntax is accurate (`STRING_AGG` with `ORDER BY`); structure handles edge cases (ties, single-activity cases, K > variants) implicitly as required.
- `LIMIT K` is a standard placeholder for such parameterized benchmarks (executable via substitution or prepared statements in DuckDB).

No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws; explanation reinforces correctness without extraneous content.
