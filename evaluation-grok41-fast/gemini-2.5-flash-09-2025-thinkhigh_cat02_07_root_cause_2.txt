**9.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—structured perfectly against the task (1: identify cases; 2: analyze attributes; 3: explain + mitigate), data calculations are precise (durations verified exact: e.g., 2002=25h55m, 2003=48h20m, 2005=77h5m; approximations like "1.4 hours" for 2004's 1h25m=1.417h are trivial rounding), tables are clear/insightful, correlations logical (Complexity primary via doc loops; Region B worse for high; Lisa/Bill bottlenecks), mitigations actionable/tied to evidence. **Nearly flawless**, but deducted 0.5 for minor issues:
- **Minor inconsistency**: 2003 duration "2 days 20 min" (correct) but later "48 hours" (truncates 20m; hypercritical pedantry).
- **Slight overemphasis**: Calls 2005 "primary" while correctly analyzing 2002/2003 as issues (2002's 26h is "significant" vs. <2h baseline, but medium complexity makes it borderline "outlier" vs. true high-complexity pattern).
- **Tiny unclarity**: Region finding implies B "higher latency risk" but doesn't quantify avg (A high=48h vs. B high=77h clear, but no low/med avgs across regions for full control).
No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or omissions—analysis deduces attributes rigorously (e.g., request counts, gaps). 10.0 reserved for zero quibbles.
