The provided answer delivers exactly 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions that precisely align with the prompt's requirements. Each question is clearly derived from the described supply chain process (e.g., specific suppliers in Taiwan/Japan/South Korea/Germany/US, Malaysia assembly, JIT strategies, distribution centers in Europe/North America/Asia/Latin America, digital systems, analytics, quality/warranty/recalls, sustainability). They effectively probe insights (e.g., Q17 on sales data), potential issues (e.g., Q4 disruptions, Q15 cybersecurity), improvement strategies (e.g., Q7 blockchain, Q10 inventory minimization), and decision implications (e.g., Q3 ethics, Q12 recalls, Q20 consumer shifts). No SQL queries or extraneous content in the final list; all questions are grammatically precise, logically sound, and free of inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws.
