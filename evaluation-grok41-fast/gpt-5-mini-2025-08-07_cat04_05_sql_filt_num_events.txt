**9.0**

This answer is excellent overall and functionally correct for the core task: both queries accurately identify cases with 6 events and return the qualifying events using proper grouping/filtering (aggregate + HAVING in A, window COUNT in B). Both are efficient in DuckDB, handle the requirements precisely, include sensible ORDER BY (unasked but beneficial for event logs), and the NULL note shows thoughtful edge-case awareness. Option A is flawless—it uses SELECT *, preserving all columns ("full set of events" even if >3 columns exist).

Minor deductions for strict/hypercritical evaluation:
- Presents **two queries** instead of **a single** query as explicitly requested ("craft a DuckDB SQL query"), turning it into options/advice rather than direct compliance.
- Claims "equivalent" despite **inaccuracy**: Option B projects only 3 columns (case_id, activity, timestamp), potentially omitting others (table has "at least" those), so not fully equivalent output schema or "full events." A is superior here; B is incomplete if extra columns exist.
- No other flaws (logic sound, no errors in SQL syntax/semantics, no performance issues, correct 6 logic).

These are minor (no broken logic/unclear/incorrect results), but per instructions warrant a noticeable deduction from 10.0. Still very high as it's production-ready and educational.
