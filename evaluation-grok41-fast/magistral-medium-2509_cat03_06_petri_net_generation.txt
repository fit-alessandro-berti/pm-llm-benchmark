**9.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Code Only)
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**:
  - Code is syntactically correct, complete, and directly executable with pm4py (imports, net creation, place/transition addition, arcs via `petri_utils.add_arc_from_to`, markings as `Marking` dicts). Matches the example style precisely.
  - Correctly models **required loops** explicitly called out in task ("between DV and RDS", "FC and II multiple times"): DV choice (two transitions from `p_cr`, loop via `t_rds` back to `p_cr`); FC choice (two from `p_dv_ok`, loop via `t_ii` back to `p_dv_ok`). Non-deterministic choice via duplicate-labeled transitions is a valid basic Petri net idiom for data-driven branches.
  - Logical sequence: start  CR  DV (loop)  FC (loop)  CA  AP  P  N  CL  end. Arcs connect flawlessly; token flow preserves single-token invariant.
  - Initial marking (`im[p_start] = 1`): Correctly represents "new claim arriving".
  - Final marking (`fm[p_cl] = 1`): Correctly represents "closed claim".
  - Transitions labeled exactly matching activity names (e.g., "Document Verification (DV)", "Re-Document Submission (RDS)"), including abbreviations in parentheses as per scenario.
  - Places semantically represent "states between these activities" (e.g., `p_dv_ok` post-DV-ok/pre-FC, `p_dv_incomplete` post-DV-fail/pre-RDS).
  - Efficient: No extraneous elements; loops don't require extra silent transitions.

- **Flaws (deductions, even minor)**:
  - **Conditional AP not modeled (major logical inaccuracy, -0.5)**: Scenario explicitly states "must be approved... *if* the amount surpasses a certain threshold", implying a data-dependent choice post-CA (similar to DV/FC "if" conditions). Code forces linear CA  AP  P (no branch from `p_ca` to skip AP directly to pre-P). Task mentions "logical sequence with possible loops (e.g., DV-RDS, FC-II)", but AP's "if" mirrors those; ignoring it is incomplete vs. "complex" process. Hypercritical: Inconsistent with modeled choices.
  - **No representation of "Insurance Claim (C)" (-0.2)**: Scenario begins "A customer files an **Insurance Claim (C)**, after which...", with initial "new claim arriving". `p_start` implies it implicitly, but no transition labeled "Insurance Claim (C)" or explicit pre-CR place/arc. Strict: Misses listed element; initial token should arguably follow a "C" transition.
  - **Duplicate transition labels (-0.1)**: Two "Document Verification (DV)" and two "Fraud Check (FC)" transitions. Functional for choice, but unconventional (pm4py allows it, but ideal would uniquify or use silent transitions for branches). Minor unclarity in visualization/replay.
  - **Missing intermediate places post-RDS/II (-0.0, negligible but noted)**: Loops jump directly back (`t_rds`  `p_cr`, `t_ii`  `p_dv_ok`) without explicit "post-RDS state" before re-DV/re-FC. Semantically fine (place before activity suffices), but hypercritical: Slightly less explicit vs. "states between activities".

Overall: **Nearly flawless** (excellent structure, required elements perfect), but AP omission and C absence are clear logical gaps vs. scenario text (-0.7 total deduction). 10.0 reserved for *zero* issues.
