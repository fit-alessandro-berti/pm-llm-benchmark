**2.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Summary:
- **Major logical flaw (score-killing):** Coexistence constraints (`Reject_Minority`  `ManualReview`, `Approve_Minority`  `ManualReview`) are bidirectional in DECLARE semantics (A occurs iff B occurs). Combined with new `existence["ManualReview"]`, this *forces* `Reject_Minority` and `Approve_Minority` to occur in **every** trace—directly *causing* biased "minority" decisions universally, the exact opposite of bias mitigation. This renders the answer counterproductive and demonstrates misunderstanding of constraint interactions.
- **Inaccuracy in additions:** `existence` additions (`ManualReview`, `CheckApplicantRace`, `BiasMitigationCheck`) mandate these activities universally without rationale or conditional logic (e.g., better use `responded_existence`). Forcing `CheckApplicantRace` always could *introduce* bias/privacy issues, unaddressed.
- **Missing documentation:** Explanation ignores `existence` additions entirely, violating "provide a brief rationale for **each** added constraint." Only covers 4 additions; 3 unmentioned.
- **Inconsistencies/unclarities:** `Reject` in `nonsuccession` vs. `Reject_Minority`/`Approve_Minority` elsewhere—no logic for split; sloppy naming assumes unmentioned demographic-logged activities without tying to original (`FinalDecision`, etc.). Ignores other sensitives (Age/Gender).
- **Minor but compounding:** Explanation misstates `response` as "mandatory ... after" (correct but vague); doesn't preserve original activities' bias links (e.g., no `FinalDecision`-sensitive ties). Format valid, originals preserved, but net effect flawed.
- **Overall:** Creative intent but fundamentally broken logic/omissions make it unreliable/worse-than-nothing. Only partial credit for format adherence and relevant constraint *types*. Nearly flawless? No—core fails.
