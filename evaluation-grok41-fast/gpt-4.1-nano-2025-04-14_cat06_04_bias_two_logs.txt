**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting higher base score)**: Correctly identifies **Group B as the log exhibiting bias** (+1.5), accurately describes the core manifestation via explicit "+10 Community Boost" tied to CommunityGroup in U001/U003, leading to approvals despite comparable/lower prelim scores (e.g., U003's 695705 vs. P002's 710 rejected) (+1.5). Good comparison of processes/outcomes between groups (+1.0). Clear structure, markdown use, and concise summary/conclusion (+1.0). Notes lack of adjustments in Group A (+0.5). Addresses ScoreAdjustment column directly (+0.5). Ties to systematic favoritism/disparate impact (+1.0). Total base: ~6.5-7.5.
- **Inaccuracies (major deductions)**: Factual error in "Role of LocalResident": States "**All applicants in both groups are not local residents**" — **wrong; Group B rows are *all* TRUE (local residents), not FALSE or "not"**. Further claims "some entries as TRUE in Group B" — **wrong; *all* 15 rows in B are TRUE** (-1.5, core data misread on key required attribute). Dismisses LocalResident influence too casually ("doesn't seem to significantly influence") without noting its perfect correlation with group (A: all FALSE/non-local, no boosts; B: all TRUE/local, where boosts occur) — shallow/erroneous analysis of required factor (-0.8).
- **Unclarities/Logical Flaws (deductions)**: Garbled LocalResident sentence is confusing and self-contradictory ("FALSE / TRUE attributes show some... but this aside") (-0.5). Bias framed mostly as *within* B (community vs. no community), underemphasizing *between-group* systematic differences (e.g., only unprotected/locals get boosts at all; non-locals/protected cannot) despite question's "compare these two logs" and "systematic differences in final decisions" (-0.6). Minor nit: "Users P001" (not "users," CaseIDs) (-0.1). Over-relies on within-B disparity without quantifying cross-group (e.g., U001's extra +10 on same 720 as P001) (-0.2).
- **Overall**: Strong core identification/explanation (bias via CommunityGroup/ScoreAdjustment in B), but not "nearly flawless" due to data inaccuracy on LocalResident (directly contradicts table, ignores question's explicit instruction to consider it) and incomplete between-group nuance. Strict deduction yields 7.2; flawless would be 9.5+.
