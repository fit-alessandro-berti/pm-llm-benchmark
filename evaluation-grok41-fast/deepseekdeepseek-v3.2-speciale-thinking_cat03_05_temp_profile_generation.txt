The final answer provides a perfectly structured, syntactically correct Python dictionary that directly addresses the task. It includes a representative subset (25 pairs) of activity pairs, with clear complexity via multi-step separations (e.g., ('SS', 'AS'), ('RC', 'AS'), ('QI', 'AS')). All keys are valid ordered tuples where the first activity logically precedes the second in the supply chain process. Values are tuples of plausible, estimated integers (averages and stdevs in seconds), derived systematically from a consistent linear model (cumulative means and sqrt(sum variances) for stdevs, with appropriate rounding). Means are exactly additive (e.g., ('SS', 'OP') + ('OP', 'RC') = ('SS', 'RC')), and stdevs scale realistically (small for adjacent ~hours/days, large for distant ~weeks/months). Covers all activities, matches example format, no inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws.
