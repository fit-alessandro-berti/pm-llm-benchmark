**8.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**:
  - **Comprehensive structure**: Excellent breakdown into expected flow, per-model analysis, table comparison, and justified conclusion. Covers all required task elements (anomalies, severity, comparison, decision).
  - **Accurate core anomaly identification**:
    - Model 1: Correctly flags parallel Screen  Decide (skipping interviews possible), Interview dead-end, lack of Interview  Decide linkage. Recognizes mostly sequential/mandatory post-Decide steps.
    - Model 2: Correctly flags parallel Post  Interview/Post  Screen (illogical interview-before-screen), Screen dead-end/disconnected, Payroll optional (XOR with skip, severe for Hire-to-Retire), unnecessary operators enabling skips.
  - **Correct final conclusion**: Model 1 closer to normative (justified by mandatory Payroll/Onboard, better integration/ordering of early steps vs. Model 2's optional Payroll, disconnected Screen, reversed early logic). Payroll optionality is indeed a fundamental violation; Model 1's issues are less integrity-breaking.
  - **Logical comparison**: Table and justification effectively weigh severity (e.g., business rule violations > structural flaws), aligning with process logic.

- **Inaccuracies/Unclarities/Flaws (strict deductions, -2.0 total)**:
  - **Major factual error on POWL loop semantics (-1.5)**: Repeatedly claims Model 2 allows "skipping onboarding entirely" via `*(Onboard, skip)` (table: "No"; text: "skipping onboarding entirely is not acceptable"; "can be skipped via loop"). **Incorrect**—per explicit definition ("execute A [Onboard], then either exit or B [skip] + A again"), Onboard is **mandatory** (1 execution). Misrepresents Model 2 as weaker here (falsely equates to Payroll skip), inflating its anomalies unnecessarily. Persists uncorrected into table/conclusion support; not minor, as loop is central to Model 2.
  - **Minor sloppiness on Model 2 Screen (-0.5)**: Calls Screen "isolated—no incoming or outgoing edges (except from Post)." Has incoming (Post  Screen), so not "no incoming"; phrasing unclear/redundant, understates as "disconnected" without precision on execution impact (optional dead-end branch).

- **Overall**: Nearly flawless in scope/logic/conclusion (9.5+ base), but loop error is a clear model misunderstanding (not "flow of thought"—embedded in final analysis/table), warranting significant penalty per "utmost strictness"/"any inaccuracies." No other logical flaws; verbose but clear. 10.0 requires zero issues.
