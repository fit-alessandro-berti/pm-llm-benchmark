**10.0**

The provided SQL query and explanation are nearly flawless, precisely addressing all requirements with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws:

- **Sequence detection**: Self-joins on consecutive `rn` (via `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)`) correctly enforces *direct succession* (no intervening events), matching activities exactly.
- **Timing filter**: `confirm_order_timestamp > create_order_timestamp + INTERVAL '5 days'` strictly uses `>` for "more than 5 days"; DuckDB-compatible syntax.
- **Case exclusion**: Correctly identifies and excludes *entire cases* with 1 qualifying sequence (via `DISTINCT` in `sequence_matches` and subsequent filter); handles multiples gracefully (`NOT IN` deduplicates).
- **Final output**: Returns *all events* from non-excluded cases (`SELECT * FROM event_log`), with sensible `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` for clarity/readability.
- **Edge cases handled implicitly**: Ties in `timestamp` ordered arbitrarily but consecutively via `rn`; non-qualifying sequences (e.g., timing 5 days) keep the case; unrelated events/cases unaffected.
- **Efficiency/Style**: CTEs modular; no unnecessary grouping/aggregation; minimal columns selected where needed.
- **Explanation**: Concise, accurate, mirrors query logic without extraneous claims.

No deductions warranted—even minor nits (e.g., potential timestamp ties) are inherent to the problem's schema assumptions and do not break correctness.
