**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
While the answer correctly identifies the **community affiliation bias** (+10 adjustment for "Highland Civic Darts Club" in C001/C004, with valid C003-vs-C004 comparison highlighting inequity), it contains critical flaws that prevent a higher score:

#### **Major Inaccuracies/Ommissions (Deduct 2.0+ points total)**:
- **Complete omission of C005**: This non-local resident (FALSE, no community) with 740 (highest score) was **Approved**. This directly contradicts and weakens the "Geographic Discrimination" claim ("non-locals face higher standards regardless of their qualifications"; "rigid for non-locals"). Non-locals can be approved if scores are sufficiently high (e.g., >715), suggesting a potential *threshold bias* (e.g., ~720 for non-locals vs. leniency to 700 for locals/club), not blanket discrimination. Ignoring 20% of cases renders geographic analysis incomplete and overstated.
- **Inaccurate threshold implication**: Claims C003's 715 is "only 5 points below seemingly approved scores," but approved scores include 700 (C004). 715 > 700, yet rejected—valid inequity point, but unaddressed inconsistency with C005 (715 rejected vs. 740 approved) misses nuance in non-local outcomes.

#### **Logical Flaws/Unclarities (Deduct 0.5+ points)**:
- **Overgeneralization**: "All local residents... approved" (true but selective); pairs with C003 to imply strong geography effect, but C005 shows locals aren't uniquely privileged *at high scores*. Compound advantage is plausible but unsubstantiated without quantifying (e.g., no threshold inference).
- **Score comparison flaw**: C003's "25 points higher preliminary creditworthiness than C004" is true (715 vs. 690), but ignores that adjustments make final scores 715 vs. 700—still highlights bias, but "underlying creditworthiness is similar" (per question) isn't strongly evidenced here (25-point gap isn't "similar"; better vs. C002 at 720).
- **Table formatting echo**: "710720" is a smashed typo (should be "710720"), reducing clarity.

#### **Strengths (Supporting the 7+ baseline)**:
- Excellent on community bias mechanics, critical role in C004 approval, and implications (social capital > financial metrics; two-tier system).
- Strong C003-C004 spotlight, systemic insights, and actionable recommendations (blind reviews, audits).
- Addresses question fully: attributes (LocalResident, CommunityGroup), adjustments (+10 Community), fairness/equity impacts.

Nearly flawless would require full case coverage (esp. C005), precise thresholds (e.g., infer ~720 cutoff with local leniency), no overstatements, and zero typos. Minor issues alone warrant ~8.5; majors drop to 7.2.
