9.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (supporting high score):**
- **Correctness of primary/recommended solution (Approach 1 - QUALIFY)**: Flawless. Concise, DuckDB-idiomatic, uses `SELECT *` for full events, correctly filters via window function (`COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) <= 6`), single-pass efficient in DuckDB. Matches prompt exactly.
- **Approaches 3 & 4**: Also flawless. Use `SELECT *`, proper `GROUP BY`/`HAVING`, return full events. Portable and readable.
- **Comprehensive explanation**: Clear "How It Works" steps, recommendation table with pros/best-for, prioritizes DuckDB-specific. Educational without verbosity.
- **No logical flaws in core logic**: All identify per-case counts accurately, filter `>6` out (`<=6` in), return full qualifying events. Handles "at least" columns via `*`.

**Flaws/Deductions (strict penalties applied):**
- **Major inaccuracy in Approach 2**: Outer `SELECT` explicitly lists only `case_id, activity, timestamp`, omitting potential additional columns (prompt states "at least" these, implying others possible). Fails to "return the full set of events." Logical flaw; this query is incomplete/wrong for general case. (-0.8; significant, as it's presented as a valid "solution.")
- **Over-delivery vs. prompt**: Asks for "a DuckDB SQL query" (singular); provides four. Helpful but deviates—could confuse or dilute focus. Not "craft a query," but "multiple approaches." (-0.1)
- **Minor presentation issues**: ASCII diagram messy/garbled (empty spaces, poor alignment, non-executable visualization). Markdown-heavy but no raw query isolation for copy-paste. (-0.1)
- **No edge-case handling**: Ignores potential NULLs/ties in `timestamp` or duplicate events (though not specified). Hypercritically, no `ORDER BY timestamp` mention if needed for case integrity. (-0.0; not required.)

**Overall**: 95% flawless (primary query perfect, extras mostly correct), but Approach 2's column omission is a clear functional error warranting deduction. Hyperstrict ceiling at 9.0 for "nearly flawless." A single perfect `QUALIFY` query with brief note would be 10.0.
