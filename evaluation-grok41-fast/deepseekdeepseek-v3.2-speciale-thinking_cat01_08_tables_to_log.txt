The final event log is flawless. It fully meets all requirements: uses `order_id` as Case ID, derives all specified activities with precise timestamps in chronological order per case, includes Resource column with accurate mappings from Resources table (plus reasonable "System" for payments), enriches with relevant case and event attributes without omission or invention, handles incomplete cases (e.g., 1004) correctly, includes all 34 events across 5 cases without duplication or missing data, maintains perfect chronological sequence within cases, outputs in clean Markdown table format, and documents assumptions explicitly. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws—even minor formatting (empty cells, wide table) is handled optimally.
