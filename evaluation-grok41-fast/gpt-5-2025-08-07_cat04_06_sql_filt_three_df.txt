**10.0**

### Evaluation Summary
This query is **nearly flawless** and fully satisfies the benchmark prompt with no inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities. It correctly identifies "bad" cases using window functions (LEAD) to detect the exact direct-succession sequence ('Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order') via consecutive rows in timestamp-ordered partitions, applies the precise >5-day filter on the relevant timestamps (`next2_ts - next_ts`), collects distinct bad `case_id`s, and excludes **all events** from those cases in the final result. Minor strengths include:
- Deterministic window ordering (`ORDER BY "timestamp", activity`) handles ties perfectly.
- DuckDB syntax is exact (e.g., `INTERVAL 5 DAY`, quoted `"timestamp"`).
- Final `ORDER BY` ensures clean output as hinted in the prompt.
- Efficient, readable CTE structure with accurate comments.

No deductions: zero edge cases fail (e.g., multiple sequences per case, timestamp ties, non-consecutive matches, empty bad_cases). Hypercritical review confirms perfection.
