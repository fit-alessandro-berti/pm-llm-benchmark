**4.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Output Only):
- **Strengths (why not lower)**:
  - Correct structure: Markdown table with exact required columns (Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource, Other Attributes).
  - Activity names perfectly match prompt examples ("Order Created", "Items Picked" as separate per-item events where multiple, "Order Dispatched", "Order Arrived", "Invoice Issued", "Payment Received").
  - Most timestamps accurate to source data.
  - Excellent resource enrichment: Mapped IDs to full names from Resources table (e.g., "SP-001 (Alice Brown)", "CR-01 (GlobalTransport)"); handled missing (e.g., "(none)" for payments) reasonably.
  - Other Attributes relevant and well-formatted (e.g., item_id/quantity for picks, delivery_id for deliveries, payment_method/reference for payments).
  - All order_ids covered; one row per event; most links correct (e.g., invoices/payments chained via IDs).
  - ~90% of rows factually correct (orders 1001, 1002, 1003, 1005).

- **Critical Flaws (major penalties; not nearly flawless)**:
  - **Data fabrication/inaccurate integration for order 1004 (fatal)**: No delivery, invoice, or payment exists for 1004 in source tables (Delivery has none; Invoice INV-1004 is 1003; INV-1005/PAY-2005 for 1005). Answer invents 4 events, wrongly assigns 1005's data (DLV-5005, INV-1005, PAY-2005 REF-CC-789) to 1004. Violates "Link each event using the keys provided", "every event for every order_id", "Combine Data". For 1004, only valid events: Created + 1 Picked (2 rows total). This corrupts the log for process mining (wrong case attribution).
  - **Non-chronological order (explicit violation)**: Prompt requires "chronological order reflects the real process flow", "placed in sequence". For 1002, rows not sorted by timestamp:
    | Row timestamps | Issue |
    |----------------|-------|
    | Disp1: 2024-01-04 | |
    | Arr1: 2024-01-07 | |
    | Disp2: 2024-01-05 | *Earlier than prior row; Disp2 actually between Disp1 & Arr1 chronologically.*
    | Arr2: 2024-01-08 | |
    Correct sequence: Created  Picked1  Picked2  Disp1 (01-04)  Disp2 (01-05)  Arr1 (01-07)  Arr2 (01-08)  etc. Table implies impossible flow (dispatch after arrival).
  - **No documentation of assumptions/missing data**: Prompt requires "If data is missing or ambiguous, document any assumptions". Silent on 1004 gaps (e.g., no note "No delivery/invoice/payment for 1004").
  - **Minor but penalized issues**: Duplicate ID usage (DLV-5005/INV-1005/PAY-2005 effectively "shared" across 1004/1005, illogical); table not globally sorted (per-case ok, but within-case broken); Other Attributes empty for Created (could include e.g., customer_id, but optional).

These are not minor: fabrication distorts cases, non-chrono breaks process mining suitability, missing docs ignores prompt. 4.0 reflects partial success (structure/data for 4/5 cases) but strict penalties for core inaccuracies. Nearly flawless would be 9-10; this fails integration/accuracy.
