**8.2**

### Strict Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: 
  - **Conceptual accuracy (fitness/precision/simplicity)**: Flawless. Perfectly captures all observed traces: RAVFAE always; XOR after AE for direct ADSCAC (case 2) or 1 RMI(s)VFADSCAC (cases 1/3, including consecutive RMI via tau silences). No overfitting (e.g., forbids unobserved AEVFAD); balances metrics ideally. Loop semantics (*('RMI', tau)) precisely enables 1+ RMI with no visible intermediates, matching log exactly.
  - **Logical structure**: Correct use of operators/branching. Duplicated end-sequence minor (could be factored but acceptable for tree). Explanation soundly justifies behavior.

- **Inaccuracies/Unclarities/Flaws (major deductions)**:
  - **Invalid syntax in core tree string (critical, -1.5)**: Primary deliverable ("just the final structure") is malformed. `-> ( 'VF', AE -> X (...))` fails parsing per prompt notation (example: `-> ( 'B', 'C' )` requires proper leaf quoting/parentheses like `-> ( 'VF', -> ( 'AE', X (...)))`). "AE ->" is bare/incomplete, rendering string non-executable/invalid as a process tree. Explanation implies fix but doesn't provide corrected string—unacceptable for "final structure".
  - **Inconsistent quoting (minor but cumulative, -0.2)**: `tau` bare (should be `'tau'` consistently); inner `->('SC', 'AC')` lacks space/quote symmetry (e.g., `'SC'` vs. implied).
  - **Explanation nitpicks (minor, -0.1)**: "one or more times" correct but phrasing "`tau` signifies... no specific activity causing the loop" slightly vague (tau *enables* silent redo precisely, not "no cause"). Task requests "just the final structure", yet includes verbose explanation—ignores instruction subtly.

- **Overall**: Near-perfect intent/logic elevates from mid-range, but syntax invalidity in the key artifact prevents "nearly flawless" (not 9.5+). Cumulative sloppiness in presentation drops from 10.
