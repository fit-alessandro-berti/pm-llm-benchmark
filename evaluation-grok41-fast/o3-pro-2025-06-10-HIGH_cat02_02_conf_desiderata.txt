**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It comprehensively addresses all task elements with precise accuracy:

- **Part 1 (Normative)**: Correctly identifies Case 1 and 3 as compliant, Case 2 as non-compliant. All violations (order reversal, post-rejection finalization, missing mandatory "Inform Applicant") are explicitly listed with direct rule mappings. No extras, no misses. Compound closing issue aptly noted as derivative.
- **Part 2 (Desiderata)**: Accurately flags all soft issues (follow-up omissions across cases; Case 3 timings with precise ~49h/~51h calcs matching log math). Appropriately deprioritizes Case 2 timings due to normative failure on inform (logical; no timing possible without event). Implicitly/subtly clarifies non-severity via "soft-goal" framing and summary; no overstatement as violations.
- **Part 3 (Interpretations)**: Provides plausible, constraint-aligned justifications for *all* cases (e.g., data-entry errors, weekends for Case 3 dates—verifiable as Jan 12 FRI to 14 SUN in 2024). Non-speculative, tied to behaviors.
- **Summary**: Concise, accurate synthesis.

No inaccuracies (e.g., timings exact; "Inform Applicant" correctly flagged as absent/universal post-decision mandate). No unclarities (clear structure, bullets). No logical flaws (e.g., doesn't treat desiderata as normative; prioritizes correctly). Minor formatting artifact in legend (symbols as placeholders) is ignorable as non-substantive. Fully exhaustive, professional tone.
