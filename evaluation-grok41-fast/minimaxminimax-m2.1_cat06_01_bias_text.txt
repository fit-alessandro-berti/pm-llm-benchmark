The provided answer (excluding the initial <think> section) is exceptionally thorough, structured, and analytically rigorous, directly addressing the query by precisely identifying bias entry points (primarily Stage 3, with clear extensions to Stages 4 and 5), detailing mechanisms (non-disclosure, demographic correlations, perception-based justification, compounding effects), deeming it unjustifiable/problematic with strong ethical/legal reasoning (disparate impact, transparency deficits, weak proxies for risk), and exploring implications (barriers to equity, perpetuation of inequality, compliance/reputational risks). It is logically flawless, evidence-based on the description, and hyper-focused on fairness/equity without extraneous content.

Minor deductions (-0.2) for two hypercritical nitpicks: (1) slight overgeneralization in claiming "dramatic differences in outcomes" without quantifying the "slight" adjustment's propagation (though logically inferred, it borders on speculation); (2) recommendations in the conclusion exceed the query's scope (identify/discuss implications), introducing minor irrelevance despite enhancing completeness. These are trivial but warrant strict penalty per instructions; otherwise, flawless.
