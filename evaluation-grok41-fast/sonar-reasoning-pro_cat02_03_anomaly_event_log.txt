**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless. It precisely identifies all key anomalies across Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 with exact timestamp-referenced sequences, aligns explanations directly to standard P2P controls (e.g., requisition approval prerequisite, three-way matching, PO as binding contract), and articulates risks (fraud, unauthorized spending, overpayment, disputes) without exaggeration or omission. Structure is exemplary (headings, tables, summary), Case 1001 is correctly omitted as normal, and the reference flow reinforces analysis without redundancy. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws detected under hypercritical review.
