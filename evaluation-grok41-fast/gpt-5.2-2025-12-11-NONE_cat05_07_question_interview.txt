**10.0**

### Evaluation Summary
This answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It delivers a meticulously organized, exhaustive list of 60+ targeted, open-ended questions that systematically dissect the process description, precisely targeting gaps in details, decision criteria (e.g., workloads, tie-breakers, thresholds), roles/responsibilities (e.g., ownership mapping, handoffs, approvals), timing/sequencing (e.g., order of inspections, review triggers, SLAs), and exceptions (e.g., remediation disputes, occupied units, escalations). Coverage spans the entire process logically from intake to post-onboarding metrics, anticipates unstated complexities (e.g., regional variations, bottlenecks), and stays strictly conceptual—no SQL, code, or implementation requests. Questions are crisp, non-leading, and phrased for rich responses (all "What/How/Who/Which"). No inaccuracies, ambiguities, redundancies, or logical gaps; even granular probes (e.g., validation sources, tie-breakers) align perfectly with the description without assuming facts. Structure enhances usability without violating the "list" format. Zero deductions warranted.
