**5.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (partial credit):** Correctly identifies core outliers (2003, 2005) with reasonably accurate durations (minor error on 2004: 85 min, not 70 min). Links high complexity and multiple doc requests to delays logically. Hypotheses and mitigations are plausible, relevant, and well-structured. Takeaways summarize key points effectively.
- **Major Flaws (heavy penalties):**
  - **Factual inaccuracies in log data (critical for analysis task):** 
    - 2003 has **only 2 requests, both on Apr 1** (11:00, 17:00); no "one on the next date." Claims "two on same + one next" – direct misread.
    - Adjuster_Lisa does **not** handle "all three long cases" (or even both 2003/2005): 2003 uses Mike (A); Lisa only on 2002/2005 (B). Overstates her as universal bottleneck.
    - Resource table for long cases lists Pay as "Finance_Carl" – false for 2003 (Alan). Inconsistent/inaccurate.
  - **Logical flaws/incompleteness:**
    - Excludes 2002 (26h, next-day spillover with 1 request) as outlier via arbitrary 48h threshold; it's significantly longer than low cases (<2h) and shares attributes (Region B, Lisa, medium complexity  doc request). Task requires identifying *all* performance issues; correlation analysis incomplete.
    - Regional effect claims B's Carl "later in week" – 2005 pay Apr4 14:00 (weekday afternoon), 2003 Alan Apr3 09:00 (morning); no evidence of "weekend push" or volume.
    - Over-relies on Lisa/Bill without noting Mike/Bill also delayed 2003 similarly (high complexity root stronger than claimed resource specificity).
  - **Clarity/presentation issues:** Step 1 table incomplete (2004 ellipsis, no full row). Messy formatting (weird spaces , inconsistent bolding, run-on code block). Vague "three long cases" without defining (implies 2002/3/5 but earlier only 2).
- **Overall:** Competent structure but undermined by multiple log misreads (core to task), selective outliers, and flawed correlations. Not "nearly flawless" – errors distort root causes (e.g., Lisa not primary). Strict deduction: mid-range score.
