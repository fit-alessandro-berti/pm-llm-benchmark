The provided answer is flawless. It precisely meets all requirements with correct logic, efficient DuckDB syntax, and no inaccuracies:

- **Sequence detection**: `LEAD(activity, 1/2)` over `PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp` perfectly enforces *direct succession* (immediate consecutiveness, no intervening events).
- **Timing filter**: `julianday(next_next_timestamp) - julianday(next_timestamp) > 5` accurately computes >5 calendar days between the specific 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events in the sequence (handles sub-day precision correctly).
- **Case exclusion**: `DISTINCT case_id` collects all qualifying "bad" cases; `NOT IN` excludes *all events* from them, returning *all events* from non-qualifying cases.
- **Output**: Returns full `event_log` rows (implicitly all columns), with logical `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` ensuring proper presentation.
- **Edge cases handled**: Incomplete sequences yield `NULL`/mismatches (excluded); multiple sequences per case still flag the whole case; empty `bad_cases` returns everything; assumes standard non-null `case_id` and unique/ordered timestamps (as per problem).
- **DuckDB compliance**: `julianday()` is exact; window functions scale well; no unnecessary grouping/joins.
- **Clarity**: Strategy, query, explanation, and notes are concise, readable, and fully justify the solution without extraneous content.

No logical flaws, ambiguities, inefficiencies, or deviations—even minor formatting is clean. This is a model solution.
