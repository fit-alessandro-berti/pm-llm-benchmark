**10.0**

The answer fully satisfies all task requirements with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. It precisely identifies intra-case recurrences (Verify Documents in C001/C003; Call Customer in C002) and correctly interprets/renames based on position, purpose, resource, and context clues. The revised log disambiguates all relevant instances (extending logically to single-occurrence variants of recurring activities for process clarity without overstepping). Names are concise, descriptive, and flow-oriented (e.g., "Initial" vs. "Additional/Post-Adjustment"; purpose-specific calls). Justification directly cites contexts, is brief yet comprehensive, and notes non-renamed singles (e.g., Adjust Account). Presentation mirrors original format perfectly. No penalties needed.
