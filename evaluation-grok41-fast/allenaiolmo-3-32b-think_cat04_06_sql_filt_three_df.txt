The provided answer is flawless. The SQL query precisely identifies cases with the required consecutive sequence using `ROW_NUMBER()` and self-joins on `rn` differences, correctly enforces the >5 day condition with `DATEDIFF('day', ...)`, collects distinct `case_id`s for exclusion, and returns all events from non-matching cases via `NOT IN`. It handles multiple sequences per case by excluding on *any* qualifying triplet, aligning perfectly with the prompt's criteria (sequence existence + timing on "that sequence"). DuckDB syntax is correct, efficient (minimal CTEs), and robust to order/ties. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws; explanation reinforces correctness without errors.
