**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Correctness of Primary Query (Weight: 40%)**: Flawless. The subquery with `GROUP BY`/`HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` and `WHERE case_id IN (...)` precisely identifies qualifying `case_id`s and returns **exactly** `SELECT *` (original schema, all columns/rows for 6-event cases). Matches problem spec verbatim: filters out >6, returns "full set of events" for 6. No extras, no aggregations. **10/10**.
- **Alternative Query Correctness (Weight: 20%)**: Mostly correct functionally (filters accurately via window `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)`), but **inaccurate schema**: `SELECT *` from subquery includes the extra `case_event_count` column in output, altering the result set beyond "full set of events" (original columns only). Problem implies unchanged event rows; this augments them. DuckDB supports `EXCEPT(case_event_count)` for fix, but omitted—minor but clear inaccuracy. Single-scan claim valid, but schema mismatch deducts. **8/10**.
- **Explanations & Clarity (Weight: 20%)**: Exemplary structure (understanding, step-by-step table, ASCII flow, why-it-works, considerations). Precise terminology ("at most six", "all columns/rows"). Diagram clear despite ASCII limits. No ambiguities. **10/10**.
- **Completeness & Edge Cases (Weight: 10%)**: Covers performance, duplicates (row-count basis), scalability. Assumes standard SQL (DuckDB-compatible). Handles unspecified extra columns via `*`. Notes "ties/duplicates" relevant. **10/10**.
- **Conciseness & Style (Weight: 5%)**: Thorough without bloat; markdown enhances readability. DuckDB-specific where relevant (optimizer note). **10/10**.
- **Logical Flaws/Unclarities (Weight: 5%)**: None major. Minor: Alternative's schema change unaddressed (e.g., no "drop column" note); performance claim ("scales better") optimistic but defensible—not false. **9/10**.

**Overall**: Nearly flawless (primary query perfect, bonus alternative useful), but schema inaccuracy in alt + no fix = -0.8 deduction. Hyperstrict: minor output mismatch prevents 10.0.
