**9.7**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—thorough, directly responsive to the question, and analytically sharp—but deducts 0.3 for minor issues under utmost strictness: (1) slight over-speculation on unmodeled correlations (e.g., "often correlate strongly with race/ethnicity" lacks evidential qualifiers, risking unsubstantiated assumption despite reasonableness); (2) legal claims (e.g., ECOA, redlining) assume U.S. jurisdiction without noting generality of the model; (3) "algorithmic bias" phrasing is imprecise for a POWL *process model* (declarative, not prescriptive algorithm); (4) recommendations section is unasked-for elaboration, diluting focus. No factual errors on the model (correctly IDs XOR paths, uplift post-selection for D, post-C/pre-E positioning). Logical flow flawless: mechanism  discrimination  implications. Structure enhances clarity. Equity/fairness discussion precise to "non-legally protected group" (locals/community members) and "incremental advantage" (subtle uplift). Impacts (disparate impact, perpetuation of inequality) directly addressed without fluff. Nearly flawless; higher deducts unwarranted.
