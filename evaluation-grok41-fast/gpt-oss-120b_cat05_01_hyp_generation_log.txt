**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (near-flawless aspects)**:
  - Perfectly aligns with core objectives: Encourages autonomous detection of anomalies (types listed generically), hypothesis generation (plausible reasons exemplified broadly), and original SQL proposal (emphasizes "entirely on its own," PostgreSQL syntax, comments, JOINs, self-contained queries).
  - Output structure is exemplary: Clear, repeatable 3-step block per anomaly; specifies repetition for multiples; mandates comments/aliases; ties queries to hypotheses.
  - Constraints are precise and comprehensive (no external data, note missing info, clarity).
  - Deliverable instruction reinforces structure without biasing content.
  - References "supplied data" correctly, assuming schema/data precede it.
  - No violations of schema/data; promotes investigation across tables.

- **Minor Deductions (strictly penalized, but not catastrophic)**:
  - **Hinting via example (0.4 deduction)**: Example SQL targets a *real* anomaly ("Ship Goods" before "Credit Check," evident in cases 1002/1003). Violates "without any hints" spirit, potentially priming the target LLM despite "illustrative only – do not include." (Not severe as data is visible and example disclaimed, but hypercritical flag.)
  - **Formatting unclarity (0.3 deduction)**: Required Structure uses Markdown (**bold**, numbering); Constraints mandate "plain text" with "no markdown beyond SQL blocks." Contradictory—target LLM could misinterpret (e.g., use/discard bold?). Emoji (1) in example comment risks non-plain-text.
  - **Verbose redundancy (0.1 deduction)**: Phrases like "concrete SQL queries—that a analyst could run" (typo: "an analyst"); minor repetition in Objective/Structure.

Nearly flawless (flaws are subtle, correctable, non-fatal; no logical errors, inaccuracies in SQL/schema, or failure to encourage autonomy). High score reflects excellence under strict lens; 10.0 reserved for zero issues.
