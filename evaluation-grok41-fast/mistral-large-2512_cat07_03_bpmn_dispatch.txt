**9.8/10.0**

### Rationale:
- **Strengths (excellent coverage)**:
  - Accurately identifies all swimlanes (Dispatch/Secretary, Logistics, Warehouse).
  - Captures the full process flow sequentially, including start/end, all major activities (e.g., clarify method, special handling decision, insurance check/execution, 3 offers, select/place order, label, package 48h, delay decision/notification, paperwork, pickup).
  - Correctly describes decision diamonds, branches (special handling yes/no, insurance yes/no, delay yes/no), merges, and post-delay flow (notification leads to paperwork).
  - Includes key details like customer info for insurance, 48h packaging limit, and customer notification.
  - Well-structured with numbered steps, clear headings, and helpful notes—easy to follow and comprehensive.

- **Minor deductions (-0.2)**:
  - Slight inaccuracy in "Merge Point (Post-Insurance and Labeling)": Insurance merges *before* "Get 3 offers" (common path with no-special-handling), while labeling is strictly linear *after* place order. No true post-insurance *and* labeling merge; it's sequential. This is a nitpick but could mislead on exact convergence.
  - No mention of explicit Logistics swimlane activities (e.g., if "Place order" crosses into it), though implied correctly.

This is an outstanding summary—precise, complete, and professional. Perfect for most practical uses.
