The answer correctly identifies the violating cases (2, 3, and 5) and non-violating ones (1 and 4), with precise sequence-based explanations tied directly to the normative description's rules and quotes. Violations are logically sound: Case 2's reversed Package/Authorize order; Case 3's improper Authorize in a cancellation path (valid inference from "directly proceed to Cancel") plus forbidden Ship post-Cancel; Case 5's skipped Package pre-Ship. Structure is clear, ambiguities resolved appropriately (e.g., no Authorize/Cancel combo allowed), and conclusions flawless.

Minor deduction for one factual inaccuracy: Case 3 timestamps misstated as Check at 09:40/Authorize at 10:00 (actual: Check 09:20/Authorize 09:40), though sequence and violation remain correct and unimpacted. No other flaws.
