It delivers exactly 20 open-ended, thought-provoking questions, each precisely aligned with the described supply chain process (e.g., specific suppliers/countries, Malaysia assembly, transportation modes, JIT vs. aggregated shipments, digital systems, analytics, compliance, recalls, sustainability). Questions systematically probe insights (e.g., #9 on ML), issues/risks (e.g., #2 geopolitics, #10 disruptions), improvement strategies (e.g., #7 optimization, #19 tech leverage), and decision implications (e.g., #12 trade-offs, #20 decentralization). No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, extras (e.g., no SQL, no intro/conclusion), or deviations—pure numbered list as specified. Grammatically perfect, highly relevant, and comprehensive without redundancy.
