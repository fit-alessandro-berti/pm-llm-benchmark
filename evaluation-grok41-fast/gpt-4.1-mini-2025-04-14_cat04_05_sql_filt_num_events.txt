The provided SQL query is correct, efficient, and precisely matches the requirements: it uses a subquery with `GROUP BY case_id` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to identify qualifying cases, then filters the full `event_log` via `WHERE case_id IN (...)` to return all events (via `SELECT *`) only from those cases. This handles grouping/filtering accurately, works in DuckDB (standard SQL), and returns the exact "full set of events for the remaining cases" without extras like ordering or unnecessary joins. The explanation is concise, accurate, and directly reinforces the logic without errors or ambiguities. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or minor issues detected—flawless execution.
