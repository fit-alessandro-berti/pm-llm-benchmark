**8.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**: Exactly 20 questions, all open-ended (using "Why," "What," "How"), thought-provoking, and directly tied to the pseudo-BPMN flows (e.g., parallel gateways in procurement #2-4, shipping splits #6, distribution parallels #17-18, end gateways #9,19-20). Covers all specified areas comprehensively: rationale (#1-3,6-7), improvements (#14-15), risk management (#4,12-13,16), decision-making (#6-9,17-18), stakeholder communication (#11), performance measurement (#10,19). No SQL queries. Clean list format, no extraneous text.
- **Flaws Deducting Points (strict deductions for inaccuracies/unclarities/logical issues)**:
  - **Major inaccuracy (-1.0)**: Q5 fundamentally misrepresents the BPMN flow. Describes "parallel tasks in the assembly phase (e.g., quality checks versus rework)" and "synchronization to avoid bottlenecks," but the diagram shows **sequential exclusive gateway** post-assembly (Quality Checks  continue OR Rework/Scrap  loop back to Assembly). No parallelism here—rework is an alternative loop, not parallel. This distorts process rationale and synchronization logic.
  - **Minor unclarity/assumptive stretch (-0.3)**: Q7 invokes "product's strategic importance," absent from diagram; feels speculative rather than diagram-grounded, weakening tie to "decision-making" in flows.
  - **Minor misrepresentation (-0.2)**: Q8 says "regional **and** global distribution centers," but diagram specifies only "Regional Distribution Centers (Europe, North America, Asia, LatAm)"—no "global" mentioned.
  - **Minor overgeneralization (-0.1)**: Q16 assumes "single source" for customs (a single task post-join), but implies unstated provider risks without diagram basis; slightly speculative.
  - **Minor redundancy (-0.1)**: Q19 and Q20 overlap slightly on join evaluation/adaptation, but not fatally.
  - **Overall**: 17/20 questions flawless; flaws prevent "nearly flawless" (no 9+). Base 10  deduct 1.7 cumulative = 8.3, rounded down to 8.2 for strictness on process fidelity.
