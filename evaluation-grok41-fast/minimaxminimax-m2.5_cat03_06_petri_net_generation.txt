**9.2**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (near-flawless aspects)**:
  - **Complete coverage of scenario**: All 11 activities (C, CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL) are modeled as labeled transitions. Logical sequence matches description perfectly. Loops correctly implemented as non-deterministic choices with back-edges: RDS loops to `p_claim_registered` (pre-DV for re-verification); II loops to `p_doc_verification` (pre-FC for re-check). Multiple iterations possible via Petri net firing rules.
  - **Places**: 10 well-named, semantically correct states between activities (start to closed). No dead ends, proper flow.
  - **Arcs**: All correct using `petri_utils.add_arc_from_to`. Choices at `p_doc_verification` (RDS vs FC) and `p_fraud_checked` (II vs CA) model optionality accurately.
  - **Markings**: Precisely as required (`im[start]=1`, `fm[p_closed]=1`), defining a valid **accepting Petri net**.
  - **Code**: Self-contained, executable, correct syntax (imports, `PetriNet.Place/Transition(name, label)`, bulk adds, arc orders). Comments and table enhance clarity without errors.
  - **Logic**: Handles "new claim arriving" (start  C), end ("closed claim"), conditionals implicitly (AP sequential, acceptable as no explicit bypass specified), unbounded loops as described.

- **Minor Inaccuracies/Flaws (deductions totaling -0.8)**:
  - **Label mismatches** (two instances, -0.4 total): 
    - `"ReDocument Submission (RDS)"`  Should be `"Re-Document Submission (RDS)"` (missing hyphen, per scenario "**Re-Document Submission (RDS)**").
    - `"Indepth Investigation (II)"`  Should be `"In-depth Investigation (II)"` (missing hyphen, "Indepth" misspelled, per "**In-depth Investigation (II)**").
    - These are factual errors in activity representation; labels must match scenario exactly for perfection.
  - **Table inconsistencies** (minor presentation, -0.2): "redocument submission" and "indepth investigation" lowercase/misspelled; "t_RDS p_claim_registered" shorthand unclear but explanatory.
  - **Unnecessary but harmless** (-0.1): Numbering in arc comments skips "10" for Notification; optional viz code unindented/commented safely.
  - **AP modeling** (no deduction): Conditional ("if threshold") modeled sequentially; correct for basic accepting net (behavioral in traces), but hypercritically could have XOR bypass for low-amount (unspecified).

No logical flaws (sound, accepts traces matching scenario), no syntax errors, no missing elements. **Nearly flawless** (-0.8 for nitpicky string accuracy), justifying 9.2 (very high, not 10.0).
