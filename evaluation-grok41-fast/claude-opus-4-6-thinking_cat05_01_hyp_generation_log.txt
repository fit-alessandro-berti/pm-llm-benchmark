**9.4**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (driving high score)**: 
  - **Comprehensive anomaly identification**: Accurately flags all key deviations per case (out-of-sequence execution, missing steps, premature actions like payment/invoice/shipment) vs. baseline 1001. Cross-cutting patterns and summary table synthesize well, prioritizing risks logically.
  - **Hypotheses**: Directly aligned with prompt—covers system errors (workflow gating), policy violations (priority bypass), training issues (resource patterns), fraud/collusion. Grounded in data (e.g., credit scores, flags, times, order values).
  - **SQL queries**: Exceptional—7 targeted, executable PostgreSQL queries using correct schema/joins (`order_event_log`, `orders`, `resources`). Each has clear purpose tied to hypotheses (e.g., Q1 for sequence/system issues, Q2/Q6 for missing/training, Q3/Q4 for specific risks, Q5 for bypass/collusion, Q7 for policy/order correlations). Efficient CTEs, window functions, aggregations flawless. No syntax errors; would run on given data.
  - **Structure/clarity**: Markdown/tables excellent for readability; summary actionable.
  - **Completeness**: Covers all 4 cases, data-driven insights (e.g., short times, resource repeats, value correlations).

- **Flaws/Deductions (strictly penalized, -0.6 total)**:
  - **Inaccuracy in 1002 illustrative table (major presentation flaw, -0.3)**: Step 5 ("Validate Stock") lists "Expected" as "Confirm Shipment" instead of "Ship Goods". Logical error misrepresents expected sequence at that position; undermines table's diagnostic value, even if text analysis is correct.
  - **Mislabeling in cross-cutting patterns (-0.2)**: "Retroactive/late confirmations" lists 1002, but 1002's `attempted_early=Y` is *early* (08:25 post-register), not retroactive/late (unlike 1003). Inflates pattern incorrectly; minor but factual error.
  - **Minor unclarities/overstatements (-0.1)**: Q6's `anomalous_cases` misses 1002 (no ship-before-confirm, has credit check)—good for its scope but incomplete for "all" anomalies; hypotheses speculate "collusion" without strong evidence (e.g., no cross-resource links proven). Case 1001 description omits arrows ("->") for flow, slight readability nit.

Nearly flawless (superior to 99% of responses); flaws are minor/presentation-only, not core analysis/SQL. 10.0 requires zero issues.
