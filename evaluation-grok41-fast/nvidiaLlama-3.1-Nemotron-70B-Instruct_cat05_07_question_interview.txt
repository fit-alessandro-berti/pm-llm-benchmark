**10.0**

This answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It delivers exactly 17 targeted, open-ended questions that precisely map to the prompt's requirements: uncovering missing details (e.g., Q1, Q4), decision criteria (e.g., Q2, Q3, Q16), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q5-8), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q9-12), and exceptions handling (e.g., Q13-17), with communication woven in where relevant (e.g., Q15, Q17). Every question directly references or logically extends elements from the process description without introducing unrelated assumptions or inaccuracies. No requests for SQL, code, or implementation details. All are conceptually deepening, phrased perfectly openly (e.g., "elaborate," "walk me through," "outline"), and logically grouped with accurate, non-overlapping categories that mirror the prompt's goals. No unclarities, redundancies, logical flaws, or minor gaps—comprehensive coverage without excess. Structure enhances usability. Zero deductions warranted.
