The final output is exemplary and flawless. It precisely delivers two distinct, correctly constructed POWL models in runnable Python code using pm4py, with exact activity labels from the description (e.g., "ReceiveApplication", "DataCompletenessCheck"). Model 1 accurately captures the unfairness via an XOR post-"SkillAssessment" between "CulturalFitCheck" and "CommunityAffiliationCheck", with proper sequencing via StrictPartialOrder edges and a LOOP for data completeness. Model 2 eliminates the bias by replacing the XOR with a direct "CulturalFitCheck" transition, maintaining identical structure otherwise. Code is syntactically perfect, self-contained per block, heavily commented for clarity, and includes optional visualization without excess. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or deviations from requirements—hypercritically perfect execution.
