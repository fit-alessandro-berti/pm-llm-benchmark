**7.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Assessment)
- **Fitness (perfect replay of log traces)**: 10/10. The model replays all three cases perfectly:
  - Case 2: AE  tau (skip loop body)  AD.
  - Case 1: AE  tau  *(RMI; exit inner)  VF  tau  exit outer  AD.
  - Case 3: AE  tau  *(RMI; tau; RMI; exit inner)  VF  tau  exit outer  AD.
  Taus are silent, so visible traces match exactly (e.g., AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD). Initial sequence RA  VF  AE and final AD  SC  AC also perfect.
- **Precision (no/minimal extra behavior)**: 4/10. Major logical flaw: the outer `* (tau, ...)` allows **multiple blocks** of (RMI<sup>+</sup>  VF), producing unseen traces like AE  RMI  VF  RMI  VF  AD (VF directly followed by RMI after tau). Log never shows:
  - Multiple re-validations (VF blocks).
  - VF  RMI successor (log VF successors: only AE or AD; RMI never after VF).
  This overgenerates invalid orders/behaviors, contradicting observed successor relations and reducing precision significantly. A XOR(tau, body) would prevent this flawlessly.
- **Simplicity**: 6/10. Unnecessarily nested/complex (outer loop + inner loop + 2x tau). Equivalent XOR version is flatter (`X(tau, ->(*(RMI, tau), VF))`), balancing better without extras. Extra structure harms simplicity.
- **Syntax/Expression Accuracy**: 8/10. Correct operators/notation matching prompt, full activity labels. Minor issues: `tau` unquoted (should be `'tau'` consistently, as leaves like `'A'` are quoted in examples); leading comma (`,->`) is artifact/sloppiness.
- **Overall Balance & Task Fit**: Captures optional RMI repetitions (inner loop good) and re-VF, but "repeating loop for missing info and re-validation" over-interpreted as repeatable VF blocks (unobserved). Log shows **single optional block** of RMI<sup>1-2</sup>  VF. Model generalizes too aggressively.

**Total: 7.2** (strong fitness carries weight, but precision flaw, overcomplexity, and syntax nitpicks deduct heavily per "hypercritical" / "significantly lower" instructions. Not "nearly flawless"—clear logical overgeneration). Ideal 10: XOR-based single optional block.
