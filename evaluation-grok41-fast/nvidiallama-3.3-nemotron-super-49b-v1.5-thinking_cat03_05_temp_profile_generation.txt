**7.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**:
  - Perfect structure: Valid Python dictionary with correct key format (ordered tuples where first precedes second logically), value format (tuples of positive integers for avg and stdev), assigned to `temporal_profile`.
  - Representative subset: 17 pairs (9 direct/consecutive + 8 indirect/multi-step), ensuring "complexity" as required (e.g., ('SS', 'AS'), ('RC', 'AS'), ('CA', 'WS')).
  - Realistic domain estimates overall: Times in seconds, plausible for supply chain (e.g., OP-RC ~5 days for lead time, short internal ops in hours, full process ~14 days). Std devs scale reasonably with distance/variability (larger for external factors like suppliers/distribution).
  - Good coverage: All listed activities used; pairs respect linear order (SS  ...  AS); mix of short/long spans.
  - Presentation: Clean code block, helpful (non-required) comments with human-readable approximations (~8h, etc.), Key Features summary reinforces requirements.
  - No invalid pairs, no reverse orders, no missing basics.

- **Weaknesses/Flaws (strict deductions, preventing 9+)**:
  - **Internal inconsistencies/miscalculations (major logical flaws, -1.5)**: Indirect times often deviate substantially from sums of component directs without justification, undermining "approximated by combining" claim in Key Features. Examples:
    | Pair | Direct sum (sec) | Listed avg (sec) | % Off | Comment implication |
    |------|------------------|------------------|--------|---------------------|
    | ('RC', 'CA') | 86400+28800=115200 (~1.3d) | 172800 (2d) | +50% | "from RCQI + QICA" |
    | ('CA', 'WS') | 14400+7200+3600=25200 (~7h) | 216000 (2.5d) | +760% | "from CAPT + PTPK + PKWS" |
    | ('PT', 'DT') | 7200+3600+86400=96300 (~1.1d) | 172800 (2d) | +80% | "from PTPK + PKWS + WSDT" |
    | ('RC', 'AS') | ~317000 (~3.7d from directs) | 1008000 (~11.7d) | +220% | "cumulative variability" |
    - Full ('SS', 'AS') 1209600 (~14d) vs direct chain sum ~773000 (~9d): +55% unexplained inflation.
    - Some match well (e.g., ('SS', 'RC') 460800 exact sum; ('OP', 'QI') 518400 exact), but selective accuracy shows carelessness.
  - **Std dev approximations inconsistent/sloppy (-0.8)**: Claimed "combining uncertainties" (implies (var) for independence), but often wrong:
    | Pair | Expected (²) approx | Listed | Off |
    |------|-------------------------|--------|-----|
    | ('SS', 'RC') | (7200² + 86400²) 86700 | 87000 | Good |
    | ('OP', 'QI') | (86400² + 43200²) 96600 | 92100 | -5% |
    | ('RC', 'CA') | (43200² + 14400²) 45700 | 57600 | +26% |
    | ('CA', 'WS') | (7200² + 3600² + 1800²) 8100 | 72000 | +790% (!!!) |
    - Cumulative stds don't always increase logically with span.
  - **Minor unclarities (-0.3)**: Key Features overclaims precision ("approximated by combining"); no note on why some indirects exceed direct sums (e.g., queuing/realism?). Direct manufacturing times unrealistically short for "high-tech electronics" (e.g., CA-PT 4h? Assembly/testing often days), clashing with inflated indirects.
  - **Completeness nitpicks (-0.2)**: Subset good but omits some logical multi-step (e.g., no ('SS', 'DT') despite complexity request); 17 pairs comprehensive but arbitrary choices.

- **Why not lower (e.g., <6)?** Core deliverable (dict) fully met; flaws are in estimation rigor, not existence/validity. Estimates still plausible individually.
- **Why not higher (e.g., 9+)?** Not "nearly flawless"—multiple quantifiable errors, logical inconsistencies between directs/indirects/comments, fail strict "no inaccuracies or logical flaws" bar. Perfect would have consistent sums/exact var or explicit non-sum rationale. 

Overall: Strong execution with fatal precision flaws under hypercriticism.
