The provided query is nearly flawless and fully satisfies the prompt's requirements with precise logic, correct DuckDB syntax, and optimal structure. It accurately identifies cases with the exact direct-succession sequence using row numbers (ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)), correctly computes the >5-day interval between the specific 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events in that sequence, excludes only those qualifying cases entirely, and returns all events from remaining cases. Minor stylistic elements like comments, GROUP BY for distinctness (unnecessary but harmless), and final ORDER BY (bonus clarity) introduce no errors. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, performance issues, or edge-case oversights (e.g., multiple sequences per case handled correctly; assumes timestamp uniqueness standard for event logs). DuckDB compatibility confirmed (CTEs, INTERVAL, timestamp arithmetic).
