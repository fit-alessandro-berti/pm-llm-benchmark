7.0

### Reasoning for Grade
- **Strengths (pushing toward higher score)**:
  - **Core logic is flawless**: Correctly uses `LEAD(1)` and `LEAD(2)` over `PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp` to detect *exact consecutive succession* of the three activities with no intervening events. This precisely matches requirement 1.
  - **Time filter correct in placement and intent**: `DATE_DIFF('day', ts1, ts2) > 5` in the `WHERE` accurately targets the timestamp delta between 'Create Order' (ts1) and 'Confirm Order' (ts2), combined with sequence check for requirement 2.
  - **Exclusion correct**: `NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_cases)` excludes *all events* from matching cases, perfectly matching requirement 3 and returning only "good" cases' events.
  - **Deduplication smart**: `QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() ... = 1` ensures one row per bad case (earliest matching sequence), preventing duplicates in the `NOT IN` subquery.
  - **Ordering nice touch**: Final `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` aligns with prompt's "proper ... ordering".
  - **Explanation accurate**: Describes intent correctly, ignoring any think tag verbosity.
  - **DuckDB compatibility**: `LEAD`, `QUALIFY`, `DATE_DIFF('day', ...)` all valid; handles NULLs with `ts1/ts2 IS NOT NULL`.

- **Fatal flaws (capping at 7.0)**:
  - **Syntax error - invalid SQL (major inaccuracy)**: Outer `SELECT` of `sequence_cases` references undefined columns (`ts_approve`, `ts_create`, `ts_confirm`). Inner subquery outputs `ts`, `ts1`, `ts2`, but outer aliases/selects non-existent names. Query fails to parse/execute (`column "ts_approve" does not exist`). Easy fix (alias in inner: `ts AS ts_approve, ts1 AS ts_create, ts2 AS ts_confirm`), but as-is, unusable.
  - **Redundant/broken computation**: Outer re-does `DATE_DIFF('day', ts_create, ts_confirm)` on undefined columns (already filtered inner). Pointless and compounds error.
  - **Time precision minor flaw**: `DATE_DIFF('day', ...)` returns *floored integer days* (`floor((ts2 - ts1) / 1 day)`), so 5 days + 1 second = 5 (not >5), but "more than 5 days" implies `(ts2 - ts1) > INTERVAL '5' DAY` for exact elapsed time (>120h). Subtle logical inaccuracy for datetimes.

- **Why not higher?** Hypercritical per instructions: Syntax failure is *not minor* (prevents benchmark success); time diff not *precisely* elapsed time. 10.0 requires "nearly flawless" (executable + exact). Why not lower? Logic/approach/handling perfect; error isolated to unused SELECT aliases (CTE still identifies `case_id` correctly if fixed); explanation salvages clarity.
- **Overall**: Excellent conceptual solution (9+), derated for execution-breaking inaccuracy (to 7.0).
