The answer is exemplary: precisely identifies Group B as biased with zero ambiguity or error; accurately dissects manifestation using direct table evidence (e.g., exact +5 boosts, score progressions for U001/U003, contrasts with Group A/U002/P002); logically flawless in causal chain (boost  adjusted CulturalFit  hiring decisions); implications section rigorously addresses disparate impact (linking to protected/unprotected access barriers), procedural inconsistency, and merit erosion without overreach or speculation; comparative equity of Group A is qualified insightfully yet concisely; no inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or logical gaps—even minor phrasing is tight and evidence-driven. Perfect alignment with question demands.
