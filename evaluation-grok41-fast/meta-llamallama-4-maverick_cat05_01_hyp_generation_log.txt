**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (supporting the score):**
- **Structure and Coverage (partial credit):** Follows a logical step-by-step format mirroring the prompt (normal flow, anomalies, hypotheses, queries). Correctly recaps normal flow. Identifies key out-of-sequence issues (e.g., 1002 Confirm before Credit; 1003 Ship before Validate/Confirm; 1004 Payment before Invoice) and some missings (1003 Validate; 1004 Credit/Validate). Hypotheses align with prompt examples (system errors, policy violations, training). Proposes 4 queries using correct tables, with 3 functional (Query 1 detects timestamp vs. event_id mismatches effectively; Query 2 perfectly finds missings per case; Query 3 useful for resource anomalies).
- **Relevance:** Queries broadly investigate identified issues/hypotheses (e.g., timestamps for errors, sequences for policy, resources for training).

**Major Deductions (strictly penalizing flaws, each costing 0.5–1.5 points):**
- **Logical Flaw in Query 4 (-1.5):** Fundamentally broken for "unusual sequences." The subquery derives "expected next" via `LEAD` on alphabetically sorted distinct activities (e.g., "Confirm Shipment"  "Issue Invoice" arbitrarily), not the actual normal flow order. This detects nonsense (e.g., flags valid transitions, misses real deviations like Register  Confirm). Ignores timestamps/event order properly; unclarified and unusable. Irreparable inaccuracy in SQL logic.
- **Inaccuracies/Unclarities in Anomalies (-1.0):**
  - 1002: Claims "'Validate Stock' is done but there's no record of 'Register Order' being followed by an immediate...'" – contradictory/misleading; Register *is* recorded (event 8), sequence just wrong (not "no record"). Implies missing when all activities present (just reordered).
  - Unusual Resources: Vague assertion ("not typically associated") with *zero examples* despite data (e.g., no mismatches like Finance doing Ship; all match depts/roles). Unsupported claim.
  - Misses key anomalies: No credit check for high-value 1004 (3000, risk); illogical "shipment_scheduled=N" (1004) yet Ship Goods; low credit (1002:650) on priority order; early attempts (1002/1003 additional_info). Ignores `additional_info`/`orders` potential (e.g., value-tier risks).
- **Generic/Weak Hypotheses (-0.5):** Lists examples verbatim but untied to specifics (e.g., no "timestamp errors explain 1004 Payment@09:05"; no "resource depts ok, so not training?"). Superficial, not investigative.
- **Query Shortcomings (-0.5):** Not tightly linked to *hypotheses* (prompt: "investigate these hypotheses further"). No `orders` joins (e.g., high `order_value` sans Credit Check). No `additional_info` parsing (e.g., credit_score<700 but proceeded). Query 1 assumes event_id strictly sequential (true in data, but unstated risk if not).
- **Minor Issues (-0.3 total):** Normal flow minor nit ("Logistics/Warehouse" – schema is Logistics); no 1001 baseline contrast; no risk quantification (e.g., shipped sans checks = fraud vector).

**Why not lower/higher?** 7+ for solid core (good queries cover 75%, anomalies ~70% hit rate); <8 for non-flawless (broken query + misses = not "nearly flawless"). Total deductions: -4.3 from 10 (strict scaling: majors -1+, minors -0.1–0.5).
