**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This SQL solution is **excellent in structure, logic, and adherence to requirements**, demonstrating deep understanding of the problem via CTEs for ranking, pattern matching via consecutive row numbers, time filtering, and case exclusion. It correctly:
- Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` partitioned by `case_id` ordered by `timestamp` to enforce **direct succession** (no intervening events) flawlessly with `rn + 1` joins.
- Identifies **exact sequence** anywhere in the case trace via self-joins on ranked events.
- Handles multiple sequences per case correctly: excludes the **entire case** if **at least one** matching sequence has >5 days (logical match to "cases that contain the sequence ... where the time ... of that sequence").
- Final result returns **all events** (`e.*`) from **non-bad cases only**, with sensible `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` (prompt mentions "proper ... ordering").
- DuckDB syntax is 100% correct (`ROW_NUMBER()`, `DATE_DIFF`, joins, `NOT IN`).
- Comments are precise and educational.
- Efficient for typical event logs (no unnecessary grouping/aggs; `DISTINCT` prevents dupes).

**Minor Inaccuracies/Flaws (strict deductions)**:
- **DATE_DIFF precision (deduct 0.8)**: `DATE_DIFF('day', ts_create, ts_confirm) > 5` uses **floor(days)**, missing cases where duration is >5 days but <6 full days (e.g., 5 days + 1 hour = 5.04 days  floor=5, falsely **not excluded**). "Time elapsed more than 5 days" requires **exact duration** check: `(ts_confirm - ts_create) > INTERVAL '5 days'` (or `EPOCH_DIFF('second', ts_create, ts_confirm) > 432000`). This is a **logical inaccuracy** affecting real-world data (timestamps rarely land exactly on day boundaries). Hypercritical: not "flawless."
- **Timestamp ties (deduct 0.0, negligible)**: `ROW_NUMBER() ORDER BY timestamp` only is non-deterministic on exact ties (rare, unmentioned in prompt; assumes distinct/ordered timestamps).
- No other issues: no over-exclusion/inclusion, handles edge cases (no sequences, multiple sequences, empty bad cases), no extra columns/grouping, full event return.

**Why not 10.0?** Not "nearly flawless"—timing filter has demonstrable inaccuracy (testable counterexample exists).  
**Why not lower?** Structure/perfectly matches 95%+ of spec; flaw is isolated/subtle (common in PM queries, but strict eval demands precision). Equivalent to A- in academia.
