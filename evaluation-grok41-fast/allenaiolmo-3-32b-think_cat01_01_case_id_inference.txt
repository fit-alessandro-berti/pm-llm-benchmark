**9.5**

The core task of inferring case groupings is executed flawlessly: all 18 events are correctly assigned to three distinct cases based on unique patient profiles (45M, 62F, 28M), with impeccable chronological ordering within each case, logical workflow consistency (e.g., ER injury path, infection with labs, scheduled surgery), department alignments, and matching additional_info (e.g., hairline fracture after leg X-ray, knee arthroscopy). Coverage is complete (5+7+6=18 events), no overlaps/misassignments, and interleaving is properly disentangled. The structured presentation (timelines, observations, table, summary) is clear, professional, and enhances understanding without ambiguity in conclusions.

Minor deduction (-0.5) for one factual inaccuracy in "Critical Assumptions" bullet 2: incorrectly labels Event 15 (explicitly ER department) as "Discharge from Surgery" alongside Event 18. This slips despite correct department attribution elsewhere (e.g., Case 1 observations, timelines, table), but under hypercritical standards, any inaccuracy—even isolated and non-impacting the groupings—warrants a small penalty. No other flaws: no unclarities, no logical gaps, no misses in verification.
