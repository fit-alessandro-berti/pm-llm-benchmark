The final answer provides exactly the correct, flawless DuckDB-compatible SQL query within a self-contained demonstration context. The query accurately:
- Groups by `case_id` in the subquery.
- Uses `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to identify valid cases (six or fewer events, excluding >6).
- Returns all columns (`*`) for events in those cases via `WHERE case_id IN (...)`.

No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, syntax errors, or inefficiencies. Standard SQL works perfectly in DuckDB. The Python wrapper is inert (just prints the query) and does not detract from the core SQL delivery, which matches the task precisely.
