**8.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
**Strengths (supporting high base score):**
- **Structure and Clarity (excellent):** Uses clear sections, bullet points, event orders, and summary tables mirroring the task. Logical step-by-step breakdown. Final Answer concisely recaps all 3 parts. Visual tables enhance readability.
- **Accuracy on Core Normative (strong):** Correctly IDs Case 1 (none), Case 3 (none). For Case 2, flags ordering violation (Risk before Credit) and prohibited Finalize after rejection precisely with quotes from rules.
- **Desiderata Handling (good):** Correctly distinguishes as "suboptimal/not severe." Accurately calculates timings (e.g., Case 1 <24h/<48h; Case 3 ~49h/>48h). Notes follow-up missing across cases as minor.
- **Task 3 Compliance (solid):** Provides reasonable, constraint-aligned justifications (e.g., data-entry errors, workload, pre-screening). "In line with" rules without excusing violations.
- **Comprehensiveness:** Catches *all* issues eventually (e.g., Case 2 missing Inform). Extra heatmap offer is helpful flair, not detrimental.

**Flaws (strict deductions - hypercritical lens; each docks ~0.5-1.0 for inaccuracy/unclarity/logic):**
1. **Major Inaccuracy/Inconsistency on Case 2 Normative Violations (-1.2):** Missing "Inform Applicant" (mandatory post-Decision step) is a *clear sequence skip* per rules ("must be informed"; no branch exception for rejection). Log has zero entry after 09:30 Decision. Initial Case 2 event order *omits it silently* (lists Finalize as #5 directly after Decision #4, implying it happened?). Normative summary *table* lists *only 2 reasons*, excluding this. Only flagged *later* in Desiderata/Part 3/Final Answer as "normative omission." This is illogical inconsistency—undermines "strict rules" analysis. Hypercritical: Treat as incomplete ID/explanation for Task 1.
2. **Unclarity/Typo in Desiderata Case 2 (-0.4):** "but you're explicit that it exists in normative step? Wait —" is confusing gibberish (who is "you"? Self-referential error? Breaks immersion/clarity).
3. **Minor Logic/Overreach in Desiderata Case 2 (-0.3):** Labels as "Unclear timing issues" despite *no Inform event* (not "unclear"—absent, thus infinite delay). Ties to normative correctly but muddles "suboptimal" framing.
4. **Overinterpretation in Task 3 Case 2 (-0.2):** "Finalize... for internal auditing" is speculative but "conflicts with normative" acknowledged; still slightly justifies prohibited act beyond "in line with constraints."
5. **Pedantic Misses (-0.4 total):** 
   - Case 2 Credit Check timing: "~1h" ok, but occurs *post-Risk* (desiderata is "after received," but ignores normative bleed).
   - No explicit "suboptimal clarification" phrasing in every desiderata bullet (Task 2 requires "Clarify that while... not severe").
   - Tables great but Case 2 desiderata row vague ("Unclear... else meets").

**Overall Justification for 8.2:** ~85% flawless (strong structure/content catches 95% perfectly), but core Task 1 incompleteness (missing Inform in table/initial analysis) is a "significant" flaw per instructions—equivalent to partial credit on key ID/explain. No criminal/low-effort issues. Very high (9.5+) requires zero slips. Rounded up slightly for eventual full coverage/tables.
