**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Structure and Format (Perfect: +2.0)**: Keys exactly match. All constraint values are correctly typed sets of 2-tuples. `activ_freq` is a dict of sets. Python syntax valid. No ambiguities.
- **activ_freq (Perfect: +2.0)**: All activities mapped to `{1}`, aligning perfectly with a mandatory linear sequence per case (single order). No skips implied in scenario.
- **directly_follows (Good: +1.5)**: Forward chain `{('RO', 'CA'), ..., ('IC', 'RP')}` correctly captures "first  second immediately after" for the described sequence. Logical and complete.
- **always_after (Adequate but flawed: +1.0)**: Same forward chain as `directly_follows`. "If first occurs, second in one of the following events" fits immediate successors in a linear process without branches/loops. However, phrasing suggests *eventual* successor (transitive closure like RO  RI), not just immediate; lacks transitive pairs (minor incompleteness).
- **always_before (Critically Wrong: -2.0)**: Same forward chain as above. Definition: "If *first* occurs, *second* executed *previously*" requires **reversed** pairs (e.g., `{('CA', 'RO'), ('RI', 'CA'), ...}`: if CA occurs, RO was previous). Forward pairs invert logic (implies CA before RO, contradicting scenario). Fatal semantic error.
- **equivalence (Wrong: -1.5)**: `{('RO', 'CA')}` arbitrary/unjustified. Scenario treats RO (entry) and CA (verification) as distinct sequential steps, not same occurrences. No evidence of mutual implication. Should be empty `set()`.
- **never_together (Wrong: -2.0)**: `{('PI', 'QC'), ('PO', 'D'), ('IC', 'RP')}` illogical. Definition: "cannot co-exist *inside the same case*" (mutually exclusive: if one occurs, other *never* in trace). But scenario is linear—all activities co-occur once per case. Listed pairs are adjacent successors (both occur sequentially). Should be empty `set()`; no alternatives/exclusions described.

**Total: 4.0**. Structure/freq save it from <3.0, but core constraints have fatal logical flaws (wrong directions, baseless inclusions). Not "nearly flawless"—significant inaccuracies prevent high score. Ideal: empty equivalence/never_together, reversed always_before, forward others, transitive always_after.
