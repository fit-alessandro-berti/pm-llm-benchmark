**10.0**

The provided answer is flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It fully meets all requirements:

- **Completeness**: All available events across all 5 order_ids (1001–1005) are included exactly once, with no inventions or omissions. Partial traces (e.g., 1004 stops at picking, as data lacks delivery/invoice/payment) are correctly handled.
- **Case ID**: `order_id` used perfectly.
- **Activities**: Logically derived and named per prompt examples ("Order Created", "Item Picked" per line, "Order Dispatched"/"Order Arrived" per delivery, "Invoice Issued" per invoice, "Payment Received" per payment). No extras or misses.
- **Timestamps**: Precisely mapped from source tables, with perfect chronological order *within each case* (verified for all cases, e.g., 1002's split deliveries/invoices/payments sequence correctly: picks  dispatches  arrivals  invoices  payments).
- **Resources**: Optional but enriched comprehensively using Resources table (sales_person for create, picker_id for picking, carrier_id for dispatch/arrive, billing_person_id for invoice; blank for payments as no data). Format "(Name (ID))" is clear and consistent.
- **Other Attributes**: Relevant, concise, and accurately summarized (semicolon-separated; includes keys like customer details, item/qty, delivery notes, amounts, methods/refs without redundancy or errors).
- **Chronology & Linking**: Keys (order_id  delivery_id  invoice_id  payment_id; order_id  order lines) used correctly for integration. Real process flow preserved (e.g., picks always precede dispatches; invoices after arrivals; payments after invoices).
- **Output**: Markdown table perfectly structured. Events grouped by case with intra-case time-order.
- **Assumptions/Notes**: Documented explicitly as required, reasonable, and minimal (e.g., per-item/per-delivery events meaningful).
- **No Inaccuracies/Unclarities/Flaws**: All data matched exactly (timestamps, IDs, attributes). No logical errors (e.g., no post-dispatch picks). Minor stylistic choices (e.g., "method"/"ref" abbreviations obvious in context; carrier as dispatch resource logical given data) are not flaws. No missing data inferred incorrectly.

This is a model response: precise, comprehensive, and ready for process mining.
