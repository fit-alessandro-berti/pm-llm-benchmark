**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (supporting the score):**
  - Excellent structure mirroring the task (Part 1, Part 2, Summary Table, Interpretations), making it clear and organized.
  - Correctly identifies Case 1 and Case 3 as no normative violations with accurate reasoning (sequence perfect in both).
  - For Case 2 normative violations, correctly identifies **two major issues**: (1) Risk Assessment before Credit Check (direct ordering violation, timestamped correctly), (2) Finalize Documentation after rejection (explicitly forbidden).
  - Desiderata analysis mostly accurate: Correctly flags Case 3 timings (Credit Check ~49 hours >24h; Inform ~51 hours >48h) and no follow-up; appropriately downplays as non-strict via header phrasing.
  - Summary table is concise, accurate for high-level view, and enhances readability.
  - Justifications are plausible, "in line with constraints" (e.g., data entry error for order swap, external delays for Case 3), and cover relevant cases without fabricating facts.
  - No logical flaws in reported reasons; language is precise and professional.

- **Critical Flaws (deducting points significantly, per instructions):**
  - **Major inaccuracy/omission in normative analysis (primary deduction: -2.0 points):** Completely misses the **skipping of "Inform Applicant"** in Case 2, a **strict sequence violation**. Log shows Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30  Finalize at 10:00  Close at 10:30, with **no Inform Applicant at all**. Rules explicitly require "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome" (always, pre-branch), and "no skipping steps." This is as severe as the two violations noted (ordering and wrongful finalize), making Case 2 explanation incomplete (2/3 violations listed). Hypercritical view: This undermines claim of "perfect" identification/explanation for violating cases.
  - **Inconsistency in desiderata (moderate deduction: -0.5 points):** Treats missing Follow-up Call as a violation only for Case 3 (explicitly noted in log), but declares "no issues" for Cases 1 and 2 despite **no log entry for it in any case**. Desiderata encourage it "sometime before closing" for all; consistency requires noting absence across all or assuming unlogged = present (but log flags only Case 3, implying others lack it too). Creates logical unevenness.
  - **Missed task nuance (minor deduction: -0.5 points):** Task requires explicitly "Clarify that while these deviations [desiderata] are not severe, they represent suboptimal behavior." Answer implies via "(Recommended but Not Strict)" header but lacks direct statement in Part 2 or elsewhere—unclear/suboptimal compliance.
  
- **Minor issues (further deductions: -0.0 as cumulative already reflected):** No unclarities in language; no contradictions; no extraneous content. Timings calculated correctly where addressed.

**Overall:** Strong (80%+ flawless), but the core normative omission is a "significant" flaw (missed mandatory step in key violating case), warranting deduction from 9-10 range. Not "nearly flawless" (requires hyper-perfection); 7.0 reflects solid work with critical gaps precluding higher. Equivalent to A-/B+ in strict academic grading.
