**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Anomaly Identification (Strong but Incomplete - Penalty: -1.0)**: Correctly flags key out-of-order issues in cases 1002 (credit check too late), 1003 (confirm after ship), and 1004 (payment before invoice). Accurately notes missing "Validate Stock" in 1004. However, inaccurately incomplete: case 1003 also fully lacks "Validate Stock" (no mention); case 1004 lacks "Perform Credit Check" entirely (no mention). Case 1002 skips "Validate Stock"/credit initially before late logistics steps (noted indirectly but not as skipping). No note on other skips (e.g., 1002/1003 early shipment post-register only) or additional_info clues (e.g., "attempted_early=Y", "shipment_scheduled=N"). These omissions are logical flaws in comprehensive coverage of "given event log."
  
- **Hypotheses (Good Coverage - No Major Penalty)**: Appropriately hypothesizes system errors, human/manual errors, data entry bugs, process deviations—aligns with prompt examples (system errors, policy violations). Generic but relevant; tied to specific cases. Minor unclarity: could link more explicitly to additional_info (e.g., early attempts as policy bypass).

- **SQL Queries (Excellent Precision and Relevance - Bonus Toward High Score)**: Highly relevant to hypotheses; self-joins perfectly detect order violations (queries 1-3 catch exact issues in 1002-1004). Query 4 generally detects missing "Validate Stock" (catches both 1003/1004 despite listing flaw). Query 6 proactively uses `resources` table for role/dept validation (per schema). Query 5 useful but overly example-specific (minor deduction). No unnecessary joins (e.g., `orders` not needed). PostgreSQL-compatible, efficient. Would investigate hypotheses without hints.

- **Structure/Clarity/Completeness (Solid - Minor Penalty: -0.5)**: Well-organized (sections, numbered queries, summary). Summary reinforces without new errors. No unclarities, but propagates listing incompleteness from anomalies section. No verbose repetition in final output.

- **Overall Flawlessness**: Near-flawless SQL/hypotheses elevate score, but strict inaccuracy in anomaly enumeration (missed missings = significant logical gap) prevents 9+. 8.0 reflects "very good with targeted flaws" under hypercritical lens.
