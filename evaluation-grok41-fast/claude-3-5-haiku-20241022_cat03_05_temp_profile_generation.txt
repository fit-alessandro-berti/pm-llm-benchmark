**7.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**:
  - **Format perfection**: Dictionary exactly matches spec (tuple keys, tuple values with avg/stdev in seconds). Python syntax valid, well-commented with intuitive ± explanations.
  - **Content representativeness**: Includes a solid *representative subset* (14 pairs) as explicitly allowed, mixing direct sequential (8 pairs), medium-skip (4 pairs), and long-range (2 pairs), ensuring "complexity" with multi-step separations. All pairs respect logical forward order (SS earliest, AS latest).
  - **Realism and estimation**: Times are plausible for supply chain (hours for internal ops, days for logistics/procurement, weeks/months for end-to-end/after-sales). Stdevs scale logically (tighter for short-range, wider for long-range/variable processes). Extra explanation insightfully categorizes (short/medium/long) and justifies variability—exceeds basic requirements.
  - **No invalid elements**: No backward pairs, no unrelated activities, units consistent, no prompt violations.

- **Major Deductions (strict penalties for flaws)**:
  - **Internal logical inconsistency (critical flaw, -1.5)**: Non-adjacent pair times are not approximately additive from provided direct pairs, undermining the "temporal profile model" coherence. Examples:
    | Pair | Provided Avg (days) | Cumulative from directs (approx. days) | Discrepancy |
    |------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------|
    | OPCA | 4.0 | OPRC (2) + RCQI (0.08) + QICA (0.04)  2.12 | ~2x too long |
    | SSRC | 3.0 | SSOP (0.04) + OPRC (2)  2.04 | 50% too long |
    | SSPT | 5.0 | SSRC (3 provided) + RCQI/QICA/CAPT (~0.6)  3.6 | ~40% too long |
    | QIDT | 7.0 | QICA/CAPT/PTPK/PKWS/WSDT sum  1.23 | ~6x too long! |
    | SSAS | 30 | Cumulative to DT (~3.3 from directs) + DTAS (30)  33.3 | Incoherent (shorter than tail alone) |
    This violates the model's intent (times between "eventually following" activities should accumulate along paths in linear traces). Not "estimates"—it's contradictory within itself.
  - **Incomplete coverage despite "comprehensive" claim (-0.5)**: Calls it "comprehensive" but omits key representatives (e.g., no RCPT, CADT, PTAS, OPDT). Subset allowed, but hype + gaps = minor unclarity.
  - **Minor stdev illogicalities (-0.3)**: Stdevs sometimes exceed/add improperly (e.g., DTAS stdev 10d < SSAS 15d despite subset; non-propagation like sqrt(sum vars) ignored). Hyper-variability (e.g., 50%+ of mean) strains realism without justification.
  - **Unclarity in process assumption (-0.3)**: Assumes strict linear trace (SSOP...AS), fine but PKWSDT has oddly short PKWS (30min) vs. 1d WSDT—storage "until shipping" implies variable hold, not split so rigidly. No mention of potential branches/loops in "complex global supply chain."

- **Why not lower?** Flaws are logical/modeling errors, not fatal (still usable/estimates supply chain). No criminal/off-topic issues, no format errors.
- **Why not higher?** Additive inconsistency is a *core* inaccuracy for a "temporal profile" (per definition: avg/stdev of inter-activity times across traces). Strict rubric demands near-flawless internal logic—drops below 8.0. Perfect would fix additivity (e.g., set QIDT 1.5d + buffer, ensure sums align ±20%).
