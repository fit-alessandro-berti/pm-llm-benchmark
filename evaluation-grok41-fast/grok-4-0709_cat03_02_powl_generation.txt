**10.0**

The provided code is a flawless, precise, and complete representation of the described POWL scenario. It correctly constructs all required transitions, the LOOP operator for the BNC/D&R configuration phase (executes BNC then optionally loops via D&R back to BNC), the XOR operator for the exclusive CD/MD deployment choice, and the root StrictPartialOrder with exact ordering edges that enforce:

- SR  CS (mandatory sequence).
- CS  DA and CS  ACI (parallel start after CS, no edge between DA/ACI).
- DA  loop and ACI  loop (loop only after *both* DA and ACI).
- loop  deployment_xor (sequence post-loop).
- deployment_xor  QA and deployment_xor  SA (parallel/concurrent QA/SA after deployment, no edge between QA/SA).
- QA  GLA and SA  GLA (GLA only after *both* QA and SA).

No silent transitions are needed (none specified or implied beyond operator semantics). All nodes are included in the root PO without extraneous elements. The code is syntactically correct, uses the exact required imports/classes, and mirrors the prompt's example structure. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, missing dependencies, incorrect operator usage, or deviations from the scenario description. Hypercritical review confirms zero issues.
