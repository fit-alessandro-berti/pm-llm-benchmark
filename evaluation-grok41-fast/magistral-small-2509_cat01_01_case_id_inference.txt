9.0

The grouping into three cases is completely accurate, covering all 18 events without overlap or omission, with perfect matches on patient_age, patient_gender, timestamps, departments, activities, and logical sequences that align with hospital workflows (e.g., ER fracture case with X-ray tying to diagnosis, infection case with lab-to-prescription flow, scheduled surgery pathway). Patient descriptors are consistent, and the presentation is clear and comprehensive.

However, there is one clear factual inaccuracy in the final listing: Case 1, event 12 incorrectly attributes "resource: Dr. Smith" instead of the original "resource: Dr. Lee". This is a minor transcription error (likely copy-paste from nearby event 11), but under hypercritical evaluation, any inaccuracy—even in a single attribute across dozens—prevents a flawless score, warranting a deduction. No other flaws, unclarities, or logical issues.
