**9.4**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**:
  - **Direct Accuracy to Model**: Precisely identifies the XOR (D vs. skip), links "selection for D" to score uplift (as stated in comments), and explains mechanism correctly—uplift only via D path, skip denies it.
  - **Bias Insight**: Excellently unpacks how routing/selection criteria (inferred from D's definition: local residency/community) act as proxies favoring certain applicants, correlating with non-protected groups. Ties to "subtle" incremental advantage perfectly.
  - **Implications Coverage**: Comprehensive on fairness/equity—disparate impact, transparency, amplification of inequalities, lack of justification. Example scenario illustrates concretely without speculation.
  - **Structure/Logic**: Flawless flow (mechanism  implications  why issue  mitigation  conclusion). No contradictions; builds rigorously from model.
  - **Clarity/Conciseness**: Professional, bulleted, readable; no verbosity in core content.

- **Minor Deductions (Strict Hypercriticism)**:
  - **Phrasing Inaccuracy (-0.3)**: "non-protected groups (e.g., "non-locals") lack such protections" is logically flawed/misleading. Non-locals are *disadvantaged* (skip path); locals/community (favored via D uplift) align with the "non-legally protected group" *gaining* advantage per question. Implies reverse, creating slight confusion despite context clarifying favoritism.
  - **Assumption Clarity (-0.2)**: Assumes "routing criteria" for XOR entry = local ties, but model only defines D as the *check*; selection logic is unspecified (inferred correctly but not explicitly noted as inference). Minor overconfidence.
  - **Unnecessary Extras (-0.1)**: Mitigations excellent but unasked; slightly dilutes focus on "discuss implications" (though enhances depth).

Nearly flawless—award 10 only for zero issues. This is exemplary, with deductions purely for nitpicks under "utmost strictness."
