**8.0**

### Explanation of Grading (Strict Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**: Correctly identifies **Group B** as exhibiting bias (+1.0). Accurately describes manifestation mechanism (+5 boost only for club members, tied to unprotected group traits, changes outcomes for hired cases in B but not A) with precise case references (e.g., U001/U003 boosts push below A's threshold). Logical table structure highlights key metrics (hire rates equal but raw CF lower in B, boosts enable hires). Strong implications discussion (formal equality violated, disparate impact, meritocracy corruption, feedback loops) directly addresses question (+2.0). Clear, structured format with bolding for readability. Bonus insight in unasked corrective actions shows depth (+0.5). Overall conclusion and reasoning flawless in logic and relevance.
- **Deduction for Inaccuracies (-1.5)**: 
  - **Major math error**: Mean adjusted CF for Group B listed as 64.3, but correct calculation is (65 + 60 + 63) / 3 = 62.667 (62.7). This is a factual inaccuracy in the core comparative table, inflating B's post-boost performance misleadingly (62.7 < 63.3 vs. erroneous 64.3 > 63.3). Alters nuance of how bias "manifests," even if conclusion holds.
  - **Sloppy claim**: "Membership... perfectly correlated with LocalResident=TRUE" is false. Correlation is strong (club only in TRUE cases) but imperfect (U002: TRUE, no club, no boost). Overstates proxy nature; precise phrasing would be "strongly associated" or "exclusive to."
- **No other major flaws**: No logical gaps, unclarities, or omissions. Minor nit (e.g., assumes ~65 CF threshold without explicit data, but well-supported inferentially). Extra content enhances without detracting.
- **Overall**: Nearly flawless (9.5+ potential), but strict policy demands significant deduction for demonstrable inaccuracies in data analysis. 8.0 reflects excellence tempered by hypercritical review.
