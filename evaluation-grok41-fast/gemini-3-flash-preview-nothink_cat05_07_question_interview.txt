**10.0**

### Evaluation Summary
This answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It fully adheres to the prompt by delivering a **list of targeted, open-ended questions** that precisely target **missing details** (e.g., vendor lists, handoffs), **decision criteria** (e.g., weighting factors, tie-breakers), **roles/responsibilities** (e.g., veto power, decision authority), **timing/sequencing** (e.g., concurrent tasks, bottlenecks, audit timing), and **exceptions** (e.g., compliance failure, custom clauses). No questions request SQL, code, or implementation details—all are purely conceptual probes grounded in the process description.

**Strengths (no flaws here):**
- **Comprehensiveness**: 15 questions systematically cover the entire process lifecycle (docs  assignment  inspection/marketing  tenanting  audits) without gaps or redundancy. Added communication flow (unstated in prompt but implied in process) enhances depth without straying.
- **Structure**: Logical categorization improves clarity; intro contextualizes without fluff.
- **Open-endedness**: All use "who/how/what/can/is there" phrasing to elicit elaboration, with precise examples (e.g., "credit score vs. lease length") guiding without leading.
- **Accuracy**: Every question directly quotes/references process elements (e.g., "workload, geography," "custom lease clauses") without misrepresentation or assumption.
- **No logical flaws**: Sequencing respects process flow (e.g., probes parallelism post-assignment/inspection); exceptions align with described "potential exceptions."
- **Clarity/precision**: Concise, professional language; no ambiguities, jargon overload, or invented facts.

**Hypercritical check for minor issues**: Zero. No typos, awkward phrasing, over-speculation (e.g., "Lead-to-Live" is a neutral interviewer coinage for probing unstated targets), or scope creep. Exhaustively flawless—worthy of maximum score.
