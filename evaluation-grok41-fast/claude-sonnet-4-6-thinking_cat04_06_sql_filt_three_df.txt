**10.0**

The solution is nearly flawless: it precisely implements the requirements using window functions (`LEAD`) to enforce direct succession (immediate consecutive rows per case, ordered by `timestamp`), correctly computes the >5-day interval between the specific 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events in that triplet, identifies and excludes entire matching `case_id`s via `DISTINCT`, and returns **all events** (`*`) from non-matching cases with appropriate ordering. DuckDB syntax is accurate (`INTERVAL '5 days'` works natively). No logical flaws, inefficiencies, ambiguities, or edge-case oversights (e.g., multiple sequences per case handled by `DISTINCT`; assumes non-NULL `case_id` reasonable). Explanations are precise and reinforce correctness without errors. No deductions warranted under hypercritical scrutiny.
