**8.5**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Correctness (major strength, but not flawless)**: The subquery and CTE approaches are 100% correct, efficient, and return the full set of events (`SELECT *`) for qualifying cases (`<=6` events per `case_id`). They precisely match the task: count events per case, filter cases, then retrieve all events for survivors. Window function approach is *logically sound* for filtering but **flawed in output**: outer `SELECT` explicitly lists only `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`, omitting any additional columns (prompt specifies "at least" these, implying possible extras). This fails to "return the full set of events." Additionally, it includes no mechanism to drop the extra `event_count` column if adapted to `SELECT *`, potentially polluting output. Claim that "All three yield the full set" is **inaccurate/false**, a logical error.
  
- **Completeness & Clarity**: Excellent structure—provides 3 equivalent styles (user-choice friendly), clear code blocks, concise explanations tying to mechanics (e.g., "annotates each row"). Covers readability/conventions. Matches DuckDB (standard SQL, no issues). Fully addresses "full set of events" intent in 2/3 methods.

- **Style & Best Practices**: Idiomatic SQL. Aliases consistent (`el`, `sc`, `sub`). No unnecessary complexity. Window uses subquery to avoid correlated pitfalls (good). JOIN in CTE is efficient.

- **Minor Flaws (deducting from perfection)**:
  - Typos/unclear phrasing: "a count 6" (missing "<= "), "with 6 events" (incomplete, should specify "<=6" everywhere for precision); "INsubquery" (missing space). Hypercritical: reduces polish.
  - No explicit `ORDER BY timestamp` or handling of potential duplicates, but prompt doesn't require (events are raw log).
  - Assumes no NULLs/indexes issues, unstated but fine.
  - Window flaw alone prevents 10 (not "nearly flawless"); combined minors prevent 9+.

Overall: Outstanding (beats single-query answers), but inaccuracies/logical flaw in one method + minors warrant deduction from elite score. Equivalent to A- under strict rubric.
