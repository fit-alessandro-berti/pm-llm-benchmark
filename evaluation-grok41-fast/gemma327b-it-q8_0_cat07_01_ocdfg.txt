**7.2**

### Reasoning for Grade:
- **Strengths (boosting score)**:
  - Correctly identifies core structure: 3 main flows (VendorInvoiceItem, ReturnOrderItem, SalesOrderItem) converging early, branching decisions, arrows for flow, timings in ms, and end points.
  - Good coverage of key nodes (e.g., Create Requisition, Approve Requisition, Check Stock, Approve Payment, Create Invoice, Pack Goods, Ship Goods).
  - Captures timings reasonably (e.g., 250-1000ms for Check Stock, 500-600ms for Approve Payment, 200ms for Pack Goods) and infers purpose (workflow optimization).
  - Thorough and structured breakdown with lists.

- **Weaknesses (deducting points)**:
  - Minor inaccuracies/misreads: Convergence is at "Create Requisition" (not "Approval requisition"); some timings mangled (e.g., "3-400ms" for ~300-400ms arrows, "800-450ms" or "10-300ms" seem approximate/misparsed from image labels like 800ms, 450ms, 100ms, 300ms).
  - Typos and inconsistencies: "ReturnoOrder", "SalesOrderitem", "MS" vs. "ms", comma in "2,0-5,0", awkward phrasing (e.g., "process bubble displays overall numeric indicator").
  - Incomplete details: Misses some nodes (e.g., "Process Return", "Customer Delivery", "Close Order"); doesn't fully map all branches or colors (e.g., purple/green/orange lanes).
  - Slightly vague on decisions/branches and shared vs. unique paths.

Solid effort—comprehensive but polished accuracy/clarity would push to 9+.
