**9.5**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Correct Identification of Biased Log**: Accurately pins Group B's log as exhibiting bias (+1.0), as it uniquely displays the anomalous "+10 (Community Boost)" adjustments absent in Group A's log. This manifests the disparity directly. Minor deduction (-0.2) for phrasing "Group B exhibits bias" being slightly imprecise—technically, *Group B's log* reveals the system's favoritism toward unprotected applicants, but the protected group's disadvantage is inferred via comparison; no standalone "bias exhibition" in isolation.
- **Explanation of Manifestation**: Flawless breakdown of LocalResident (FALSE in A  no access; TRUE in B  eligibility), CommunityGroup ("None" in A  exclusion; present in B  trigger), and ScoreAdjustment (0/N/A in A; +10 in B's qualifying cases) (+2.0). Precisely traces propagation from PreliminaryScoring to FinalDecision.
- **Systematic Differences in Decisions**: Exemplary case comparison table and analysis (e.g., U003's 695705 Approved vs. P002's 710 Rejected highlights decisive boost and even stark score inversion: 705 approved where 710 rejected, proving disparate impact) (+2.0). Notes hypothetical boost for P002 720 (matching P001 approval). No statistical rate claims (correctly, as both 2/3 approvals), focuses on mechanism—avoids flaw.
- **Logical Flow and Insights**: Systemic exclusion tied to attributes; structural vs. explicit bias; two-tiered system—all precise (+2.0). No inaccuracies (e.g., correctly handles N/A/0 vs. adjusted scores).
- **Clarity and Completeness**: Structured, tabular aids, comprehensive yet concise. Addresses all question elements (+2.0).
- **Minor Deductions**: Hypercritical—slight unclarity in "despite potentially qualifying" (data implies non-locals can't join local clubs, unproven assumption; -0.2). Repetitive boost emphasis across sections (verbose, -0.1). Conclusion's "protected characteristics" assumes LocalResident proxy without explicit data link (-0.0, as implied by group labels).

Nearly flawless; only nitpicks prevent 10.0.
