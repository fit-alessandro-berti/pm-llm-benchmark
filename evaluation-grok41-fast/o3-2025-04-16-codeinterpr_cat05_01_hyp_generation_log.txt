The provided prompt is nearly flawless. It precisely fulfills the requirements by:

- Including complete schema descriptions for all three tables.
- Providing the normal process flow.
- Incorporating sample data (with standard abbreviation via "…" for brevity in a ready-to-use template, explicitly referencing "shown in the data above" which aligns with the full event log tables in the context; the "illustration only – real log is larger" note appropriately frames it without limiting analysis).
- Clearly instructing the target LLM to perform exactly the three tasks: detect/describe anomalies, hypothesize root causes (with non-hinting examples like "system issues"), and propose SQL queries (specifying "concrete SQL queries—using only the tables provided" to guide scope without syntax/examples/hints).
- Enforcing a logical, structured output (A/B/C) that ties hypotheses to anomalies and includes query notes, enhancing clarity without violating rules.
- Explicitly prohibiting SQL syntax explanations or instruction repetition.

No inaccuracies (schema/flows/data match originals), no unclarities (references are standard and contextual), no logical flaws (tasks chain coherently: anomalies  hypotheses  investigative SQL; no leading on content/SQL). Hypercritical review confirms zero minor issues—standalone ready-to-use, elicits independent SQL devising, fully equips for anomaly detection in the given log (e.g., out-of-order events, skipped steps, premature activities evident in full referenced data).
