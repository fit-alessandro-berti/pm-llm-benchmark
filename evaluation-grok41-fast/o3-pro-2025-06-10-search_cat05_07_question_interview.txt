**10.0**

### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny, warranting the maximum score. It fully adheres to the prompt's requirements with zero inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws:

- **Completeness and Coverage**: Exhaustively maps to the process description, probing every stage (intake, documentation, data entry, assignment, alignment, inspection/marketing, activation/screening, quality checks) plus logical extensions (exceptions, timing, communication, handoff). Uncovers missing details (e.g., SLAs, costs), decision criteria (e.g., factor weighting, tenant selection rules), roles/responsibilities (e.g., edit permissions, approval authority), sequencing/timing (e.g., phase durations, bottlenecks), and exceptions (e.g., escalations, custom clauses)—precisely as specified.
  
- **Question Quality**: All ~30 questions are targeted, open-ended (How/What/Can you describe/Walk me through), conceptual-only (no SQL, code, or tech implementation; e.g., "automated checks" probes process awareness, not mechanics). No leading bias; each resolves ambiguities directly from the description (e.g., "special conditions or policies"  core/optional topics).

- **Structure and Clarity**: Logical categorization enhances usability without adding fluff. Intro/outro sentences frame it perfectly as interviewee-directed questions, aiding "clarity and improvement."

- **No Violations**: Zero off-topic elements, hypotheticals, or overreach. Even "Post-Onboarding Handoff" logically clarifies the described endpoint (move-in + audits). Minor phrasings (e.g., "exact decision points") are precise probes, not flaws.

No deductions needed—even under utmost strictness, this is exemplary.
