The provided solution is flawless. The SQL query precisely meets the requirements: it uses a CTE to compute event counts per `case_id` once, joins back to the original table to retrieve all events, and filters via `WHERE c.cnt <= 6` to exclude cases with more than six events while returning the full set of events for valid cases. It is correct, efficient (avoids redundant scans), readable, DuckDB-compatible, and handles edge cases implicitly (e.g., no events for invalid cases). The explanation accurately describes the logic without extraneous details. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws.
