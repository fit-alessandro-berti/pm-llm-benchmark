**9.7**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—comprehensive, well-structured, accurate, and analytically rigorous—but deducts a minor 0.3 for two subtle issues under utmost strictness: (1) occasional speculative phrasing that slightly overreaches without tying back explicitly to the provided text (e.g., "predominantly white, middle-class communities" or club demographics as "older, affluent locals" introduces untextual examples that, while plausible for implications, risk implying unsubstantiated assumptions); (2) minor unclarity in phrasing like "non-protected demographic segments (e.g., long-term local residents)" which paraphrases accurately but could more precisely quote the text's "certain non-protected demographic segments—such as long-standing residents" to avoid any interpretive looseness. These are nitpicks in an otherwise flawless response, but per instructions, even minor issues warrant deduction. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or major omissions; it precisely maps bias loci, balances justifiability, and deeply engages implications with evidence-based nuance.
