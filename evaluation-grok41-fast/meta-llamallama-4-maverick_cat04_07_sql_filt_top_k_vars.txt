**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
This answer is **excellent overall** and functionally correct, earning a very high score for accurately solving the problem with a clean, modular DuckDB SQL query using CTEs. It precisely meets all core requirements: ordered per-case sequences via `LIST(activity ORDER BY timestamp)`, grouping/counting by sequence (array), top-K ranking via `ROW_NUMBER()`, and filtering `event_log` to return **all events** only from matching cases. DuckDB syntax is flawless (`LIST` for ordered array_agg works perfectly). The explanatory structure adds clarity without fluff.

However, under **utmost strictness**, minor issues prevent a perfect 10.0 (deducting 0.8 total):
- **Minor logical inefficiency (0.3 deduction)**: `activity_sequences` is computed *twice* (once for variant discovery, once for final filtering). This is correct but suboptimal—could be avoided by extracting top-K `case_id`s in an additional CTE (e.g., join top sequences back to `activity_sequences` for `case_id`s, then semi-join `event_log`). Not a bug, but hypercritical of unnecessary recomputation.
- **Ties handling in ranking (0.2 deduction)**: `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY count DESC)` arbitrarily orders ties (e.g., two variants with count=10; one gets rank 1, other 2). For "top K by frequency," `DENSE_RANK()` or `RANK()` would better handle ties without excluding equally frequent variants. Not wrong (prompt doesn't specify), but a logical gap in edge cases.
- **Unspecified parameter handling (0.2 deduction)**: `:K` requires manual replacement, but prompt implies a self-contained query for "top K" (no mention of parameterization). A minor unclarity—better as a CTE (e.g., `WITH k AS (SELECT 5 AS K), ... WHERE rank <= (SELECT K FROM k)`) for completeness/portability. Note to "replace" mitigates but doesn't eliminate.
- **Unnecessary final ORDER BY (0.1 deduction)**: Adds ordering not required by prompt ("Return all events"). Cosmetic, but strictly extraneous (could bloat output spec).

No major inaccuracies, syntax errors, or failures (e.g., correctly handles array grouping/IN, preserves all events/columns, excludes non-top-K cases). Fixes these minors for 10.0.
