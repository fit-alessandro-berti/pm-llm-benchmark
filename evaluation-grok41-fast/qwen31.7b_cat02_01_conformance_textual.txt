**7.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score):**
  - Correctly identifies the violating cases: 2, 3, and 5 (Cases 1 and 4 implicitly compliant by omission, which aligns with task to "identify which cases... deviate").
  - Structure is clear, with numbered violations, sequences, specific violations, and explanations referencing the description.
  - Core violations accurately pinpointed: Case 2 (Package before Authorize), Case 3 (Ship after Cancel), Case 5 (missing Package before Ship).
  - Interprets ambiguities reasonably (e.g., missing steps as violations; Ship never after Cancel).

- **Flaws Penalized (strict deductions):**
  - **Case 3 major logical inaccuracy/unclarity (heavy penalty, -1.5):** Explanation correctly notes Ship after Cancel is prohibited but then states "violating the normative rule that **Ship** must occur **only after** **Cancel** (and not after cancellation)." This is fundamentally wrong and self-contradictory—Ship should *never* occur after Cancel (per "never after a cancellation"). The phrasing inverts the rule, creating confusion. Repeated in summary. This is not minor; it's a core misstate of the normative constraint.
  - **Case 5 inaccuracy (moderate penalty, -0.8):** States "**Ship**... occurs **before** the **Package Items** activity." Package *never occurs*, so Ship cannot "occur before" it (temporal ordering implies both exist). Acknowledges "Package is missing" later, but initial violation phrasing is logically flawed/misleading.
  - **Minor unclarities (-0.3):** Sequences lack proper formatting (e.g., `Receive  Check  Package` uses spaces, not arrows). Case 3 overlooks secondary issue (Authorize before Cancel after Check implies wrong branch). Summary's "All three cases deviate" is vague (which three? Assumed, but imprecise). No explicit statement on compliant cases (1,4), though not strictly required.
  - **Overall completeness:** Nearly flawless identification but explanations have precision issues, preventing 9+.

Score reflects utmost strictness: perfect identification/ structure merits ~9 base, but logical flaws in explanations drop it significantly to 7.2 (solid but not "nearly flawless").
