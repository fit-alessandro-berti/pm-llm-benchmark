**4.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (partial credit basis):** Anomalies correctly identified (credit-after-ship in 1002, confirm-after-ship in 1003, payment-before-invoice and inconsistent status in 1004; severities reasonable). Hypotheses plausible and cover system errors/policy violations. First SQL query fully correct, relevant, executable (validates credit-after-ship hypothesis with proper joins/timestamps). Structure clear, tied to hypotheses.
- **Major Flaws (severe deductions):**
  - **Incomplete anomaly detection:** Missed missing activities (e.g., no "Validate Stock" in 1003/1004; no credit check in 1004; early "Confirm Shipment"/"Ship Goods" in 1002 skipping prerequisites). Ignored potential patterns like priority orders (1002) enabling skips.
  - **SQL errors crippling 3/4 queries (unrunnable, illogical):**
    - Query 2: `oe2.resource_id`/`oe1.resource_id` columns DNE (table uses `resource`); irrelevant same-resource filter (ship/confirm by different roles); subquery flawed for existence check.
    - Query 3: Same column errors; no `WHERE` on `oe1` causes massive overcount/duplication; illogical same-resource filter; nested subquery risks multiple rows/NULLs; `oe2.resource_id=oe1.resource_id` nonsensical.
    - Query 4: `resource` ambiguous (unqualified in subquery SELECT/JOIN  syntax error); CTE outputs only `resource` but references nonexistent `ar.case_id`  syntax error; `total_orders` meaningless (anomaly-only cases); `oe2.resource_id` DNE in subqueries.
  - No queries check missing activities, resource roles/depts fully, or order_value vs. payment amounts.
  - Hypotheses vague/uninvestigated (e.g., no query for "overloaded credit officer" via timestamps/resources).
- **Minor Flaws:** Some queries inefficient/unoptimized (correlated subqueries); no aggregation for patterns across all cases; ignores `resources` table effectively except partially in Q4.
- **Overall:** ~25% flawless (anomalies + 1 query), but core SQL deliverable broken  mid-low score. Not "nearly flawless."
