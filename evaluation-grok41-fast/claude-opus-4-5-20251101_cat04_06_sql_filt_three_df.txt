**9.5**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Correctness of Query Logic (10/10)**: The query perfectly identifies cases with the exact direct succession using `ROW_NUMBER()` for sequencing and `event_seq + 1` joins—flawless enforcement of "no other event in between." The time filter `ts_confirm - ts_create > INTERVAL '5 days'` is precise for DuckDB (interval arithmetic and comparison work correctly). Exclusion of entire cases via `NOT IN` matches the requirement exactly. Handles multiples sequences per case correctly with `DISTINCT`. Edge cases (empty results, no matches, overlapping sequences) behave as expected. No logical flaws.
- **Completeness (10/10)**: Returns **all events** (`SELECT el.*`) from non-excluded cases, preserving original table structure ("at least" specified columns). No unnecessary ordering/grouping imposed, but prompt's "proper... ordering" is satisfied in CTE logic.
- **DuckDB Compatibility (10/10)**: Syntax (CTEs, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `INTERVAL`, datetime ops) is native and efficient.
- **Explanation & Structure (9/10)**: Crystal-clear breakdown, step-by-step CTE rationale, and problem restatement. Visual aid is helpful for illustration.
- **Deductions (-0.5 total)**:
  - **Minor Inaccuracy in Visual (illustrative only)**: CASE_B shows `2024-01-02` to `2024-01-04` (2 days) but labels it "5 days KEEP." Clear copy-paste error from CASE_A; misrepresents dates while intent (=5 days keeps since **>5**) is correct. Hypercritical: this is an inaccuracy in supporting material, warranting a small deduction despite not affecting query.
  - **Nitpicks (no further deduction, as trivial)**: Redundant `activity` selects in `sequences` (harmless). Assumes timestamp ties broken arbitrarily (real-world fine; prompt implies distinct ordering). No `ORDER BY` in final output (unrequired).

Nearly flawless overall—query is production-ready perfect; sole ding is non-core visual sloppiness preventing 10.0.
