**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Syntax Validity (Critical Failure: -3.0)**: The dictionary contains a malformed key `('OP051, 'PT')`, which is invalid Python syntax (unclosed string/comma error inside tuple). This renders the entire `temporal_profile` unparsable (SyntaxError on execution). No valid Python dictionary was produced, violating the core task requirement.
- **Activity Label Accuracy (Major Error: -1.5)**: `OP051` is a nonsensical typo (should be `'OP'`); no such activity exists in the scenario. Breaks referential integrity.
- **Logical Consistency of Times (Major Flaw: -2.0)**: Averages do not accumulate logically for "eventually following" pairs in a sequential supply chain. Examples:
  | Pair | Listed Avg (days) | Expected Cumulative (approx.) | Discrepancy |
  |------|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|
  | SSPT | 21 | SSCA (15) + CAPT (0.5) 15.5 | +5.5 days |
  | SSPK | 22 | SSPT (21 listed, but inconsistent) + PTPK (0.75) 22.75? No—base chain SSCA+... 16.25 | Inflated arbitrarily |
  | OPPT | 20.9 | OPCA (15) + CAPT (0.5) 15.5 | +5.4 days |
  Times for distant pairs are systematically inflated without justification (e.g., no loops/variants explained). Violates temporal model expectations where `AVG(AC)  AVG(AB) + AVG(BC)`.
- **Standard Deviations (Minor-Mid Flaw: -0.5)**: Scaled up reasonably (e.g., ~25-50% of avg), but not propagated correctly (should approximate (var1 + var2) for sums); arbitrary without trace-based rigor.
- **Coverage & Complexity (Strength: +1.0)**: ~35 pairs, good mix of direct (e.g., RCQI) and multi-step (e.g., SSAS), representative of linear flow with separation. Ensures "complexity."
- **Realism & Units (Strength: +1.0)**: Estimates plausible for supply chain (14d lead time, 1h inspections, 10d storage variability); all in seconds with exact multiples (e.g., 14×86400=1209600). Comments aid but have Â± encoding glitch (minor).
- **Completeness & Format (Mid: +0.2)**: Tuples correct elsewhere; subset justified. Extra explanatory text unnecessary but harmless.
- **Base Score Adjustment**: Starts at 10, deducts for *every* flaw (per instructions). Effort in volume/estimates mitigates to mid-low, but disqualifying errors dominate. Not "nearly flawless"—fundamentally broken and illogical.
