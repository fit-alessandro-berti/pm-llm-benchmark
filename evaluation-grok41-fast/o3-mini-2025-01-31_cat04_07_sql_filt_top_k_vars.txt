**10.0**

The provided solution is nearly flawless and fully satisfies the benchmark prompt with utmost precision:

- **Correct sequence extraction**: `STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp)` per `case_id` accurately computes the ordered variant string, handling timestamps correctly (DuckDB supports this syntax natively).
- **Grouping and counting**: `variant_counts` properly groups by variant and counts cases.
- **Top K selection**: `top_variants` correctly ranks by `case_count DESC LIMIT <K>`, handling the unspecified tie-breaking appropriately (arbitrary but valid per SQL semantics).
- **Filtering and output**: `filtered_cases` precisely identifies qualifying `case_id`s via equi-join, and the final `SELECT el.*` returns *all original events* only from those cases, excluding others, preserving the event log structure.
- **Efficiency and clarity**: CTEs are logically sequenced, self-contained, and readable; placeholder `<K>` is explicitly documented as a parameter replacement, aligning with the prompt's lack of input spec.
- **No inaccuracies**: Handles multi-activity cases, potential duplicate activities (e.g., "A->B->A"), empty cases (empty variant string), and timestamp ties (stable per SQL). Delimiter `'->'` is unambiguous and conventional for process mining variants. No extraneous ordering, filtering, or columns added.
- **DuckDB compliance**: Fully valid syntax; no PostgreSQL/MySQL-specific quirks.

No logical flaws, unclarities, or minor issues detected under hypercritical scrutiny. Explanation reinforces without redundancy.
