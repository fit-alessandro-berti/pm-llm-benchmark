### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—comprehensive, structured, accurate, and analytically rigorous—but not *quite* flawless under utmost strictness, warranting a minor deduction for two small issues: (1) slight overreach in Step 5 labeling as a "tertiary bias *point*" (it manifests cumulative bias rather than independently *introducing* it, per the question's phrasing), and (2) the recommendations section, while valuable, introduces unsolicited content not directly asked for ("identify where/how... and discuss whether justifiable/problematic"), potentially diluting focus. No major inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities; tables/diagrams enhance precision without error. Proxy discrimination analysis is logically sound and directly tied to the prompt's equity implications, with balanced pro/con arguments. Empirical critiques perfectly mirror the source text. Overall, near-perfect execution.
