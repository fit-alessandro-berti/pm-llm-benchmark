The provided "answer" completely fails to address the task in the draft prompt. The draft explicitly requires crafting a DuckDB SQL query to filter cases based on event counts, but the response delivers zero SQL code—instead, it misinterprets the draft as a prompt needing refinement and outputs an improved prompt version with suggestions. This is a total non-response to the core request (identifying event counts per `case_id`, filtering >6, returning events for 6), rendering it logically flawed, inaccurate, and useless for the benchmark. No partial credit for unrelated improvements, as they do not solve the problem.
