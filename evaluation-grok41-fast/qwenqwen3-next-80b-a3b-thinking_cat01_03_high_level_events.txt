The response fully and flawlessly meets all requirements. It identifies four coherent, domain-relevant high-level steps (Material Preparation, Assembly, Coating Process, Final Inspection) that logically aggregate all low-level events without omission, overlap, or distortion of sequence. Groupings are precise, temporally and logically justified (e.g., welding + immediate weld check as "Assembly" due to inseparability and manufacturing norms; coating application + drying as unified surface treatment). Rationales are explicit, evidence-based (citing events, resources, goals, contiguity), and address grouping criteria (temporal proximity, shared purpose, resource types, process boundaries). Names are meaningful and standard. Structure is exemplary (numbered sections, bulleted lists, dedicated rationales, summary principles). Applies seamlessly to both cases. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, redundancies, or flaws—produces an intuitive workflow overview as intended.
