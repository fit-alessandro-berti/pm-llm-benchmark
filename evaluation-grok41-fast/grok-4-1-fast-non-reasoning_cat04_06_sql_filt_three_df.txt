The provided query and explanation are flawless. It precisely identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence ('Approve Purchase Requisition' immediately followed by 'Create Order' immediately followed by 'Confirm Order') via self-joins on timestamp order and pairwise `NOT EXISTS` subqueries to enforce no intervening events. The time condition `(el3.timestamp - el2.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5' DAY` correctly filters for >5 days between the specific 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence (valid DuckDB syntax). `DISTINCT case_id` handles multiples correctly. The final `SELECT *` excludes *all events* from matching cases via `NOT IN`, returning only events from non-matching cases, ordered properly by `case_id, timestamp`. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, inefficiencies, edge-case oversights (e.g., multiple sequences/activities per case, timestamp uniqueness assumptions standard for event logs), or deviations from requirements. Explanation is accurate, concise, and reinforces correctness.
