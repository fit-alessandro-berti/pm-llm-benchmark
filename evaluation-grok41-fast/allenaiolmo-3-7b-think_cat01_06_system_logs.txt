**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (Supporting Higher Score):**
- **Completeness:** All 26 raw events transformed into table rows with required attributes (Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp) + useful additions (App, Window). No omissions.
- **Activity Naming:** Excellent abstraction to higher-level, consistent, descriptive names (e.g., "Open Email about Annual Meeting", "Highlight Key Findings in Report_Draft.pdf", "Save [Document]"). Standardized across similar actions (e.g., multiple "Typing in [Document]"). Incorporates raw details like Keys/Action/Text meaningfully without verbosity.
- **Format:** Clean Markdown table, suitable for process mining tools (e.g., importable to ProM, Celonis). Timestamps preserved exactly.
- **Explanation:** Brief, structured, covers logic for cases and activities. Addresses coherence/narrative (e.g., "coherent workflow tied to specific application or document"). Mentions temporal/app context.

**Major Flaws (Significant Deductions - Preventing 9+):**
- **Case Identification Logical Flaws/Uncoherence (Core Penalty: -2.0):** 
  - Mixes unrelated documents in Case 1 (Quarterly_Report + Document1), violating "logical unit of user work, such as editing a specific document". Same-document work split arbitrarily (Document1 across Cases 1/5; Quarterly_Report across 1/6), breaking per-document coherence. Ignores interleaving for true per-task cases (e.g., all Document1 events as one case ID="Document1", all Email as "Email_Reply").
  - SWITCH events inconsistently assigned: Some end prior case (e.g., #6 in Case 1), others start next (e.g., #12 in Case 3; #19 in Case 4). Logical inconsistency; SWITCHes should be transitions, not split-ownership artifacts.
  - Cases too granular/short (avg ~4.3 events/case), reducing analyst utility for discovery/conformance. No single "story" per case (e.g., Case 1 lacks closure; Case 3 lacks end marker).
- **Speculative/Unprofessional Elements (-0.5):** Activity names like "Typing in Document1.docx (reopened?)" inject unconfirmed assumptions (log implies reopen post-close, but unclear); undermines objectivity.
- **Explanation Mismatches Table (-0.3):** Claims "Cases begin with a FOCUS event", but Case 3 starts with SWITCH (#12), Case 5 with TYPING (#20). "Grouping all Word-related edits into separate cases for different documents" contradicts table (Case 1 mixes docs).
- **Minor Inaccuracies/Unclarities (-0.3):** Window="N/A" for SWITCH OK but could derive From/To. No derived attributes like "Keys" or "Resource=User". Lacks explicit "coherent narrative" summary (e.g., "User starts reports, handles email, reviews PDF/budget, finalizes docs").

**Overall:** Solid transformation (80% flawless), but core case logic flawed (not "coherent, analyst-friendly"), preventing elite score. Fixes (per-document cases, consistent SWITCH handling) would hit 9.5+.
