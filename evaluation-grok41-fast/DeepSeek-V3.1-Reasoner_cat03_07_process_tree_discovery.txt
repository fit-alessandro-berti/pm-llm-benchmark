**10.0**

The final process tree structure precisely captures all observed traces with perfect fitness (replays Case 1, 2, and 3 exactly), high precision (prevents invalid sequences like RMI outside the post-AE branch, multiple VFs without RMI, or AD before AE/SC/AC), and maximal simplicity (minimal operators, no redundancy, leverages tau correctly for silent redos enabling consecutive RMI). The loop requires 1 RMI when chosen (avoiding spurious VF-only), VF re-execution is correctly placed, notation is exact and consistent with the prompt's syntax/example, and the description is unambiguous/clarity-perfect. No inaccuracies, flaws, or unclarities.
