The provided answer is exemplary: it correctly identifies exactly the violating cases (2, 3, 5) with no omissions or false positives; provides comprehensive, accurate explanations for all cases (including non-violating ones for completeness); precisely quotes and applies relevant textual rules without distortion; logically interprets implied constraints (e.g., no packaging required before shipping, no fulfillment after cancellation); structures responses clearly with sequences, bulleted violations, and a concise summary; adds no extraneous claims or ambiguities; and demonstrates flawless reasoning with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. It fully aligns with the normative description's intent, resolving ambiguities conservatively and correctly (e.g., authorizing payment on a cancellation path defeats the "direct" insufficient branch). No deductions warranted under hypercritical scrutiny.
