**10.0**

The answer is exemplary: precisely identifies Group B's log as exhibiting bias (correctly pinpointing the preferential adjustments absent in Group A), with flawless accuracy in data extraction and comparisons (e.g., U003's 695705 approved vs. P002's 710 rejected as key evidence of weaker raw/adjusted outcomes succeeding due to group-linked boost). Logical structure is airtight—breaks down manifestations via ScoreAdjustment, LocalResident (correlated proxy), and CommunityGroup (exclusive trigger), directly tying to systematic disparate treatment and lower effective thresholds for Group B. No inaccuracies (handles score paradox implicitly as bias signal), zero unclarities (tabular summaries, numbered evidence, clear sections), and no flaws (addresses same-score cases like U002/P002 for completeness). Hypercritical review finds it fully comprehensive, rigorous, and directly responsive.
