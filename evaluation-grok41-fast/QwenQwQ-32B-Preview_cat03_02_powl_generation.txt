**10.0**

The final code and explanation are flawless. It precisely constructs the POWL model matching the scenario: correct transitions with exact labels, proper LOOP(Operator.LOOP, [BNC, DR]) for the repeated BNC-optional-D&R, XOR(Operator.XOR, [CD, MD]) for exclusive deployment choice, and a single StrictPartialOrder capturing all dependencies (SRCS{DA,ACI}loopchoice{QA,SA}GLA) with concurrencies where specified (no DAACI edge, no QASA edge). No extraneous nodes/edges, no silent transitions needed or added, imports/exact classes used correctly, no syntax/logical errors. Hypercritical review finds zero inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws.
