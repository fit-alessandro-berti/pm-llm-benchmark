**7.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies (9.5/10)**: Excellently identifies core contradictions (noncoexistence vs. existence forcing no E ever; precedence too loose; responded_existence lacks order enforcement). Clearly links to intended flow undermining. Nearly flawless, minor unclarity in phrasing "claims cannot be closed if evaluated" (true implication, but could explicitly note it makes E impossible).
- **Hypotheses (9.0/10)**: Strong, directly matches prompt examples (misinterpretation, incomplete updates). 4 varied, plausible reasons. No fluff, logical.
- **SQL Verification (5.0/10)**: Major flaws drag down:
  - Query 1: Flawless for noncoexistence violation.
  - Query 2: **Logical error** – Claims "closed but never evaluated," but query selects *all* claims without E (no JOIN/FILTER on C). Returns irrelevant non-closed claims. Direct mismatch comment vs. code = inaccuracy.
  - Query 3: Good for order anomaly (A after E), but doesn't address responded_existence violation (E without *any* A, per prompt example "evaluation always correspond with assigned").
  - Query 4: Good for ideal flow skips, but OR logic finds partial skips (not strict AND for full violation); extra but relevant.
  - Missing: Precedence violation (C without prior R), existence check (claims without C), init (traces without R). Incomplete coverage of model/prompt examples.
  - Minor: No DISTINCT/GROUP BY (duplicates possible); irrelevant "[5][9]" artifact.
- **Overall Structure/Clarity (9.0/10)**: Clean sections, independent presentation, no hints leaked. Concise impacts.
- **Composite**: Strong analysis/hypotheses, but SQL inaccuracies/logical flaws/incompleteness prevent "nearly flawless" (per instructions). Strict penalty for SQL issues (~half-weight task).
