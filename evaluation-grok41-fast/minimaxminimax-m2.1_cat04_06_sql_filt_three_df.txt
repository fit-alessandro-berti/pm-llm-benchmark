The provided SQL query correctly identifies "bad" cases using row numbers to enforce direct succession via self-joins on consecutive `rn` values, accurately filters for the exact activity sequence starting from 'Approve Purchase Requisition', applies the precise time condition `(e3.timestamp - e2.timestamp) > INTERVAL 5 DAY` between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order', collects distinct `case_id`s, and excludes all events from those cases by filtering `event_log` with `NOT IN`. The `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` provides proper ordering as implied by the prompt. DuckDB syntax is valid (e.g., `INTERVAL 5 DAY`, timestamp subtraction yields interval). No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical flaws; handles the requirements perfectly despite potential timestamp ties (unavoidable without `event_id`, and ordering by `timestamp` is as specified). The explanation reinforces correctness without errors.
