The provided answer is flawless: both SQL queries (subquery and window function) are semantically and syntactically correct for DuckDB, precisely fulfill the requirements (correctly group by `case_id`, count events via `COUNT(*)`, filter `<=6` via `HAVING` or window, and return full qualifying event rows via `SELECT *`), preserve all original columns/events, and handle edge cases (e.g., empty table, zero-event cases, ties at exactly 6). Explanations are precise, structured, and error-free, with no ambiguities, inefficiencies, or extraneous output. The comparison table adds value without detracting. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws whatsoever.
