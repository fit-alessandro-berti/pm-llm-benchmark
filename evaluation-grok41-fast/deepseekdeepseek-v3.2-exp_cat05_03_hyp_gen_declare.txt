**8.0**

### Explanation of Grading (for transparency, not part of response)
- **Strengths (driving high base score):** Excellent structure mirroring tasks. Anomalies accurately pinpoint core issue (noncoexistence of E/C forbids intended flow), with solid ties to intended logic and incompleteness. Hypotheses mostly plausible and match prompt style (1,2,4 strong). SQL queries are syntactically correct, efficient, and directly verify key anomalies/violations (1-4 spot-on for noncoex, responded_existence, skipping; well-chosen EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, GROUP BY). Covers prompt examples precisely. Independent presentation, no hints leaked.
- **Weaknesses (deductions for strictness):** 
  - Anomaly 1 title "Contradiction between Precedence and Noncoexistence" imprecise— no direct rule-rule conflict; it's vs. intended flow (-0.5).
  - Hypothesis 3 logically flawed/inaccurate: Data with erroneous E+C *together* would induce *coexistence* support, not noncoexistence enforcement (opposite effect; undermines credibility) (-1.0).
  - Query 5 insightful but tangential (specialization mismatch not in model; prompt's "correspond with assigned adjusters" covered by #3) (-0.3).
  - Minor unclarities: Responded_existence treated loosely (ignores potential "after A" semantics mismatch with flow AE); no query for init/precedence (#5 could check C without prior R) (-0.2).
- **Overall:** Near-flawless execution (90%+ ideal), but logical error in hyp3 + minors prevent 9+. Hypercritical lens demands perfection for 9-10.
