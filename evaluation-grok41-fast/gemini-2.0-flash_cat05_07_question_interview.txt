**7.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown):
This answer is strong in structure (clear categories mirroring the process stages), coverage of decision criteria (e.g., track record metrics, tenant suitability thresholds, negotiation latitude), roles/responsibilities (e.g., compliance officer focus, inspector vetting), exceptions (e.g., special insurance, custom clauses, slow landlords), and overall depth (20 targeted, mostly open-ended questions uncovering hidden details like pain points and examples). It avoids SQL entirely and is conceptually focused in ~90% of questions. The closing statement reinforces intent without adding fluff.

**Major Flaws (Significant Deductions):**
- **Implementation details violation (critical, -1.5 points)**: The question "Can you elaborate on the 'central property database' you use? What kind of information architecture does it use, and how does it contribute to downstream processes?" directly probes "information architecture" (e.g., schemas, data models, hierarchies), which is a technical implementation detail explicitly forbidden by the prompt. This is not "conceptual understanding" (e.g., a better version would ask "What key property details are entered and how do they inform later steps?"). Even one such question taints the list.
- **Weak coverage of timing/sequencing (-1.0 point)**: The prompt explicitly requires questions to "verify timing and sequencing." The answer has zero direct probes (e.g., no "How long does X step typically take?", "Are photographer/inspector visits parallel or sequential to marketing?", "What triggers moving from docs review to manager assignment?", "Overall timeline from contact to activation?"). Indirect touches (e.g., follow-up on slow docs) are insufficient; this is a core gap in a "complex process" with noted decision points and dependencies.
- **Borderline specifics risking implementation drift (-0.3 point)**: Questions like "typical range of repair costs," "data sources for pricing models," and "type of information stored for future functions" flirt with quantitative/operational details that could elicit implementation responses (e.g., specific APIs/tools), though they stay mostly conceptual.

**Minor Flaws (Further Deductions):**
- **Redundancy/overkill (-0.4 point)**: 20+ questions is excessive for a "series" (prompt implies concise probing); the final "documentation stored" question repeats earlier doc review probes without adding unique value. Categories like "Exceptions & Communication" mix in unrelated metrics/efficiency questions.
- **Unclarity/minor logical gaps (-0.4 point)**: Some questions assume unstated details (e.g., "repair costs allocation" implies company involvement not fully described); lacks probes on stakeholder handoffs (e.g., "Who coordinates between regional office, manager, and IT?") or full lifecycle loops (e.g., "How are back-and-forth communications escalated?"). One question ("landlord choice of manager") is speculative without strong process tie-in.
- **Not "nearly flawless"**: ~10% flawed/missing elements prevent 9+ score under hypercritical lens.

**Strengths (Not Enough for Higher Score)**: Excellent organization, 80%+ questions are precise/perfect (e.g., performance metrics, red flags, bottlenecks), comprehensive on decisions/exceptions, fully open-ended.

Starting from 10.0, deductions total -3.6  **7.4 rounded down to 7.2** for strictness on even minor issues. A 9+ requires zero violations, full prompt alignment, and zero gaps.
