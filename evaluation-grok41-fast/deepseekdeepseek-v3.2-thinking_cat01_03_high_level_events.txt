**10.0**

The answer is exemplary and fully compliant with all instructions. It precisely identifies coherent high-level steps (3 logical phases covering all events without overlap or omission), provides domain-relevant names, delivers detailed rationales tied to sequence, temporality, resources, and purpose, and uses a clear structured format (numbered sections with bulleted events/rationale + summary table). Groupings are logically flawless (preparation  assembly/weld verification  finishing/inspection), consistent across cases, and reduce granularity effectively while preserving workflow essence. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws.
