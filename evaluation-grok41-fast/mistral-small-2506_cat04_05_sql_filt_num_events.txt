The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. The SQL query correctly uses a CTE to compute event counts per `case_id` with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`, precisely filtering to retain only cases with 6 events while excluding those >6. The subsequent `INNER JOIN` (implicit via `JOIN`) accurately retrieves all columns (`e.*`) for qualifying cases without data loss or extraneous rows. DuckDB compatibility is ensured via standard SQL features (CTEs, aggregates, `HAVING`).

- **Accuracy**: Perfectly matches requirements—no over/under-filtering, preserves full event details, handles grouping/filtering as specified.
- **Efficiency/Clarity**: CTE is optimal (avoids correlated subqueries); unused `event_count` alias is harmless (logical query order prevents HAVING alias reference anyway).
- **Extras**: `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` is unrequested but logically sound (groups cases, sequences events chronologically), enhancing usability without altering semantics.
- **Explanation**: Concise, accurate, step-by-step; reinforces query logic without errors.
- **Formatting**: Clear Markdown/SQL block; no syntax issues.

No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or even minor issues (e.g., no redundant computations, no alias misuse, no assumptions beyond schema). This warrants maximum score.
