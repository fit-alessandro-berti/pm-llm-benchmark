**1.0**

No answer is provided in the query for grading. The instruction explicitly states "How would you grade the following answer", but nothing follows—no Python dictionary, no code, no content whatsoever representing a response to the prompt. This is a total omission, rendering evaluation impossible and equivalent to submitting nothing. Under hypercritical strictness, even minor issues warrant significant deductions; a complete absence is the ultimate flaw, warranting the minimum score.
