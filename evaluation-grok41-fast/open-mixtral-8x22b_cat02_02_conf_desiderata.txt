**4.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
**Strengths (partial credit basis):**
- Correctly identifies Case 2's two normative violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection).
- Accurately describes Case 3's desiderata failures (Credit Check >24h; Inform Applicant >48h post-decision; no Follow-up Call) and clarifies they are suboptimal/not severe.
- Part 3 provides some plausible external justifications for Case 3's desiderata issues (backlog, resources) and partially qualifies Case 2's finalize issue as unjustifiable.

**Major Flaws (significantly penalizing score):**
1. **Critical omission in Part 1 (normative violations):** Completely misses that Case 2 **skips "Inform Applicant" entirely** after Loan Decision—a clear, explicit normative violation ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; sequence requires it before Close Case). This is a "skipping activities" prohibition, noted in "What is Not Allowed." Case 2 has **three** normative violations, not two; listing only two makes the explanation inaccurate and incomplete. Hypercritical penalty: this alone warrants <5.0.
2. **Incomplete coverage of cases in Part 1:** Fails to explicitly state Case 1 fully complies with all normative rules (perfect sequence, no skips/reversals/wrong actions) or confirm Case 3 has **no normative violations** (despite delays, sequence is correct: no skips, proper Approved path). Implying via silence is unacceptably unclear; task requires identifying "which cases" violate, demanding exhaustive case-by-case analysis.
3. **Incomplete desiderata analysis in Part 2:** Only flags Case 3; ignores potential desiderata issues in others. Case 1 lacks Follow-up Call (desideratum: "encouraged... before closing"; Case 3 log explicitly notes absence, but uniformity implies others do too). Case 2 lacks Inform Applicant (promptness desideratum violated worse than delay) and Follow-up. No analysis of Case 1/2 desiderata = partial failure to "identify which cases."
4. **Logical flaws in Part 3 (justifications):** Attempts to justify Case 2's **normative** order reversal ("unforeseen circumstances")—directly contradicts "in line with the given constraints" (normative are "strict," "at no point should... reverse order"; no justifications allowed for violations). This introduces inaccuracy by implying violations can be excused, undermining "strict rules." Case 1 unaddressed entirely. Justifications only for Cases 2/3, ignoring Case 1's flawless compliance.
5. **Minor but compounding issues (further deductions per "hypercritical" instructions):**
   - Unclear phrasing: Part 1 says "Case 2 is violating" without case numbering for others; lacks precision.
   - No suggestions for fixes/improvements (e.g., "insert Inform before Close in Case 2"), despite task allowing "when possible."
   - Assumes justifications for strict violations without noting they are impossible "in line with constraints."

**Overall:** Addresses ~60% of content accurately but with critical misses (skipped step, incomplete case coverage) and logical errors (justifying strict violations). Not "nearly flawless"—major inaccuracies prevent >5.0. Strict rubric demands perfection for high scores.
