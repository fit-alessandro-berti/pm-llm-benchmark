**3.2**

### Grading Rationale (strict evaluation):
- **Major inaccuracies (severe deductions)**: Core task is precise event-to-case grouping by ID. Answer fails critically:
  - Event 11 (Doctor consultation, 62F, 08:22:54Z, diagnosis=minor_infection) is **entirely missing** from all cases.
  - Event 12 (Doctor consultation, 45M, 08:23:10Z, hairline_fracture) wrongly assigned to Case B (62F); belongs to Case A.
  - Event 13 (Surgery performed, 28M, Surgery dept, 08:25:19Z) **duplicated** in Case A (illogical: mismatches patient_age/gender/dept for 45M ER) and Case C (correct).
  - JSON fudges timestamps/details (e.g., Case A id:13 uses event 12's timestamp/details; Case B id:12 uses event 11's) but retains wrong IDs, confirming misassignment.
  - Result: Incomplete coverage (17/18 events, but 1 missing + 1 duplicate + 2 misassigned), violating unique partitioning.
- **Logical flaws**: Claims "patient_age/gender unique" enables "direct match," yet violates this (e.g., event 13's 28M/Surgery forced into 45M/ER). Workflows implausible (e.g., ER case includes unrelated surgery). Temporal order per case mostly holds but undermined by errors.
- **Unclarities**: Table/JSON IDs contradict reality (e.g., Case A event 13 labeled "Doctor consultation...ER" despite actual Surgery/Surgery). No acknowledgment of issues.
- **Strengths (minor credit)**: Correctly identifies 3 cases by patient demographics/depts; most events (~80%) correctly grouped; chronological ordering mostly accurate; professional format/rationale structure.
- **Overall**: Fundamentally flawed conclusions despite good intent/structure. Not "nearly flawless"—multiple cascading errors in the **only elements to grade** (final outputs). Equivalent correct grouping: Case A=[1,4,7,**12**,15]; Case B=[2,5,8,10,**11**,14,17]; Case C=[3,6,9,**13**,16,18].
