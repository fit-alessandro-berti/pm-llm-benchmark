The response is exemplary: comprehensive, logically flawless, and precisely aligned with all three tasks. Anomalies are incisively identified with the core contradiction (responded_existence forcing E after A, noncoexistence forbidding E+C, existence mandating C) rigorously explained using formal logic, without overstatement or omission; secondary issues (skipping steps, missing P/N enforcement) are correctly tied to the intended flow. Hypotheses are diverse, plausible, and directly rooted in realistic process modeling pitfalls (e.g., bidirectional misinterpretation, mining artifacts), exceeding the prompt's examples in depth. SQL queries are syntactically perfect for PostgreSQL, targeted (e.g., Query 4 directly probes the unsatisfiable A+E+C path; Query 3 validates responded_existence temporally with timestamps and links to adjusters via `resource`), comprehensive (covering coexistence violations, bypasses, orderings), and efficiently use the schema (claims, claim_events; implicit adjuster tie-in). No inaccuracies, ambiguities, redundancies, or extraneous content; independent presentation; minor formatting artifacts (e.g., →) are ignorable as non-substantive.
