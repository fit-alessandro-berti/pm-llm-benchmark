The provided code is a flawless representation of the described POWL model. It accurately captures all sequential dependencies, concurrencies (via empty StrictPartialOrder edges), the loop (* (BNC, DR)), and the exclusive choice (X (CD, MD)) using the correct classes and constructors. All edges in the root StrictPartialOrder precisely enforce the prerequisites (e.g., concurrent_setup  loop_node ensures loop after both DA/ACI; concurrent_final  GLA ensures GLA after both QA/SA). No extraneous nodes, silent transitions, or misconfigurations; labels match the scenario; imports are complete and appropriate. The structure fully aligns with POWL semantics and the scenario's partial orders, loops, and choices.
