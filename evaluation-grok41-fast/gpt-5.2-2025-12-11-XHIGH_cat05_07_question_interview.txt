**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This response is exceptionally strong overall—nearly flawless in alignment with the prompt. It delivers a **comprehensive, logically grouped list of 71 targeted, open-ended questions** that precisely target missing details (e.g., Q7-9 on docs), decision criteria (e.g., Q19-22 on assignments), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q15-17 on handoffs), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q65-68 on timelines), and exceptions (e.g., Q58-61). Sections enhance usability without adding fluff. All questions deepen **conceptual understanding** (e.g., workflows, criteria, edge cases) and scrupulously avoid SQL or implementation details (mentions of CRM/ticketing are purely conceptual, e.g., "how communicated," not "how built").

**Minor flaws deducting 0.8 points (strictly weighted):**
- **Typo/clarity issue (Q42)**: "application intake checks decision" is malformed (missing commas/words, reads as "intake checks decision"). This creates momentary unclarity—hypercritical deduction of 0.4.
- **Extraneous closing sentence**: "If you’d like, I can also turn these into..." is unrequested promotional fluff, violating "produce a list of... questions" by appending unsolicited offers. Minor bloat, deduct 0.2.
- **Length/excessiveness**: 71 questions is thorough but borders on exhaustive (e.g., Q53-57 overlap slightly on audits; could trim 10-15% for conciseness without loss). Not a flaw per se (prompt allows "series/list"), but hypercritically inefficient—deduct 0.2.

No inaccuracies, logical flaws, or prompt violations (e.g., no closed questions, no tech specs). Structure is superior. A 10.0 requires zero issues; this is as close as possible.
