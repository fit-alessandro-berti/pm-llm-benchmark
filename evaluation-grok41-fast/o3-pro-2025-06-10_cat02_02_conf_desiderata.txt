**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (Supporting High Score):**
- **Accuracy on Normative Violations (Task 1):** Flawless identification. Case 1: Correctly compliant. Case 2: Precisely lists all violations (RA before CC; missing Inform Applicant—a mandatory post-LD step; FD after rejection; consequential invalid Close). Case 3: Correctly compliant, with sequence explicitly verified. No misses or inventions.
- **Accuracy on Desiderata (Task 2):** Precise calculations (e.g., Case 3: 49h CC, 51h IA). Correctly identifies all fails (timings, missing Follow-up across cases; notes IA absence in Case 2). Clarifies non-severe/suboptimal nature ("minor sub-optimality," "soft-rule," "not severe normative problems"). Distinguishes from hard rules well.
- **Interpretations/Justifications (Task 3):** All cases covered with plausible, constraint-aligned explanations (e.g., Case 2 "rushed RA... accidental FD"; Case 3 weekend staffing). Practical, non-speculative, tied to logs/timings.
- **Structure & Completeness:** Clear sections matching tasks. Summary concise and accurate. Covers all cases/logs exhaustively.
- **Logical Flow:** No flaws; violations explained causally (e.g., Case 2 Close "after illegitimate finalisation").

**Weaknesses (Deductions for Strictness - Total -0.8):**
- **Unclarities/Formatting Issues (-0.4):** Desiderata legend incomplete/broken ("Legend:  = recommendation not met"—missing symbol like ; renders unclear). Bullet lists misaligned (excess spaces, e.g., "24 h                        OK"; inconsistent indentation). Sequence in Case 3 normative mangled ("Application  Credit Check"—missing  arrows from prompt style; reads choppy).
- **Minor Inconsistencies/Typos (-0.3):** Spelling "Finalise" (British) vs. log's "Finalize" (American)—repeated 2x, creates subtle discord. Case 2 desiderata redundantly flags IA "not done" under timing desideratum (it's primarily normative, though noted separately; risks confusing overlap). "Several hard-rule violations, the case is invalid" phrasing slightly informal/absolute (prompt uses "violating," not "invalid").
- **Minor Omissions/Overreach (-0.1):** Interpretations strong but Case 1 justification thin ("team may have deemed... unnecessary"—slightly assumptive vs. prompt's "when possible"). No explicit note that Follow-up is "encouraged—but not strictly required" verbatim (implied but not quoted for emphasis).

**Overall:** Content is 99% flawless—exceptional analysis, zero logical errors/misreads of log/constraints. Deductions only for presentation unclarities and nits, per "hypercritical" mandate. 10.0 requires zero issues; this is "nearly flawless" but not pristine.
