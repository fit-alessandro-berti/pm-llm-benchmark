**10.0**

The response is exemplary and fully aligns with the prompt's requirements without any inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or omissions. It precisely covers all low-level events across cases (12 per case, correctly aggregated into 5 steps totaling 12), uses impeccable grouping criteria (temporal clusters, resource shifts, semantic phases), provides domain-relevant names, detailed per-group rationales, a cohesive summary, and a structured format. No minor issues exist: timestamps/ranges are exact, consistency across cases is addressed, generalizability noted, and reduction to meaningful stages achieved perfectly. Hypercritical review confirms flawlessness.
