**3.2**

### Rationale for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Output Only):
- **Major arithmetic inaccuracy**: The entry `('RC', 'DT'): (8640000, 272000)` claims ~10 days (as per inline comment) but uses 8,640,000 seconds (exactly 100 days, off by a factor of 10; correct for 10 days would be 864,000). This is a blatant logical flaw in estimation, undermining the core task of plausible temporal estimates. Repeated twice as duplicate.
- **Syntax/logical flaw**: Duplicate key `('RC', 'DT')` renders the dict invalid (Python overwrites, but listing duplicates is erroneous). Inline comment admits "Wait correction" without fixing, showing unresolved error in "final" output.
- **Unclarity and impurities**: Explanatory comments belong in thought process, not final dict (prompt expects clean "Python dictionary"). Erroneous comment ("10 days avg? Wait correction") pollutes output, indicating incomplete reasoning leaked into conclusion.
- **Minor issues compounding**: Some std devs (e.g., 272000 3.15 days) plausible in isolation but invalidated by mismatched avg. Not all pairs perfectly escalate times logically (e.g., SS-QI std=86400 matches OP-RC but ignores accumulation). Representative subset achieved (adjacent + multi-step), but flaws dominate.
- **Strengths (why not <3.0)**: Valid structure, correct activity tuples, mostly sensible estimates elsewhere (e.g., SS-QI=604800=7 days exact), includes multi-step complexity (e.g., SS-DT spans ~16 days). Uses seconds consistently, matches example style (86400,3600).
- **Overall**: Far from "nearly flawless" – critical errors in numbers/logic prevent high score. Strict deduction for any inaccuracy.
