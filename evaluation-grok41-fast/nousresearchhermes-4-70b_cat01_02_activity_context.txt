**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: 
  - Correctly identifies all recurring activities within cases: "Verify Documents" (2x in C001/C003) and "Call Customer" (2x in C002). Renames them contextually (e.g., "Initial Document Verification" vs. purpose-specific re-verifications; "Call: Discrepancy Clarification" vs. "Call: Confirmation of Adjustments"), drawing directly from "Additional Context" clues like "re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided" or "clarify account discrepancy".
  - Revised log is fully presented in a clean, combined table format (acceptable, as original was split but equivalent).
  - Justification is structured, brief per task, and explicitly cites contextual clues (e.g., sequence, triggers like "missing docs" or "stepped out"). Highlights process flow roles effectively.
  - Names are disambiguating, concise, and insightful (e.g., prefixes like "Call:" unify while suffixes specify purpose).

- **Flaws Penalized (strict deductions, even minor)**:
  - **Scope creep/over-renaming (major logical flaw, -1.5)**: Task specifies "for each activity that **recurs**" (i.e., multiples **within the same case**). Yet renames non-recurring singles like all "Call Customer" (C001/C003 only 1x each), "Approve RequestFinal Approval" (1x/case everywhere), "Submit AdditionalSubmit Additional Documents" (1x total), "Initiate RequestBranch Initiation" (1x/case), and "Adjust AccountAccount Adjustment" (1x/case). This violates precision—"recurs" means intra-case multiples only. Cross-case standardization/enhancements are unasked extras, diluting focus.
  - **Inconsistent handling of "Verify Documents" in C002 (-0.5)**: Renames its single occurrence to "Initial Document Verification" for cross-case consistency, but task doesn't require changing singles. Creates artificial uniformity not mandated.
  - **Table structure mismatch (minor but penalized, -0.3)**: Header "Renamed Activity" vs. original "Activity"; task expects "revised version of the **event log**" (same columns). Minor format deviation signals carelessness.
  - **Unclarities in justification (-0.3)**: "Other Activity Name Enhancements" section admits extras ("enhancements" beyond task). Some names slightly interpretive (e.g., "(Completeness)" infers but not verbatim from "ID scan is provided"; "(Adjustment)" good but could be tighter). "Key Observations" adds unrequired analysis.
  - **No explicit intra-case-only focus confirmation**: Justification implies broader disambiguation, misaligning with prompt's "within a single case".

- **Overall**: High-quality where on-task (disambiguation excellence), but strict task adherence lacking due to extraneous changes (not "nearly flawless"). Penalized heavily per instructions; 10.0 requires zero deviations. 7.2 reflects strong core execution offset by precision errors.
