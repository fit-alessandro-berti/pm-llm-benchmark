9.0

### Explanation of Grade
**Strengths (supporting high score):**
- Correctly identifies violating cases: 2, 3, and 5 (while 1 and 4 comply). This is flawless.
- Structure is clear, with summary of normative process, per-case analysis, violations bulleted, and overall summary. Easy to follow.
- References normative description effectively (e.g., constraints on order of Authorize/Package/Ship, no Ship after Cancel, Close as final).
- Interprets ambiguities reasonably, e.g., logical inconsistency in Case 3.
- All sequences accurately transcribed from log.

**Weaknesses (deductions for strict/hypercritical evaluation; each minor issue significantly impacts score):**
- **Case 2 explanation has logical/phrasing flaw (deduct ~0.5):** Second violation claims ""Ship order" must follow "Package items"" as justification, but Ship *does* chronologically follow Package (10:00 Package  11:00 Ship). The real issue is *no Package between Authorize and Ship* (violating Authorize  Package  Ship sequence), but the quoted constraint doesn't precisely capture this—it's incomplete/inaccurate for why Ship specifically violates. Could be consolidated into one clear violation (Package before Authorize).
- **Case 3 hesitancy/unclarity (deduct ~0.5):** Labels Authorize before Cancel an "*Ambiguity*" with "does not explicitly forbid" and "This *could* be considered a violation." This is soft/overly tentative; normative text implies direct Check  Cancel (no intervening Authorize), Authorize "only makes sense once sufficiency known," and it's part of sufficient path only. Should confidently call it a violation of "directly proceed" and path branching without hedging.
- **Minor unclarities (deduct ~0.2):** Case 5 calls sequence "incomplete" (accurate but vague; better as "skips required Package"). Case 2 summary bullet "(2) 'Ship order' without 'Package items' in between" omits "between Authorize and Ship" explicitly in bullet (clear from context but imprecise). No mention of Case 3 also lacking Package before Ship (additional deviation, though redundant to Ship-after-Cancel).
- No major misses (e.g., all cases start Receive  Check correctly; Close always final), but cumulative minor flaws prevent 10.0/near-flawless.

Overall, excellent and comprehensive (90%+ quality), but not "nearly flawless" due to phrasing inaccuracies, hesitation, and logical imprecisions in explanations. A 10 would require bulletproof precision/confidence in every violation reference.
