The provided answer is flawless. It fully meets all requirements with exact data extraction, correct linkages (e.g., payments via invoices to orders), per-event granularity (e.g., one "Item Picked" per line, two events per delivery), chronological sorting per case, appropriate resources (including logical use of carrier_id and blanks where absent), enriched relevant attributes in dedicated columns without excess NULLs or clutter, complete coverage of all events across all orders (including incomplete order 1004), documented assumptions, and a perfectly formatted Markdown table. No inaccuracies, omissions, logical flaws, or ambiguities.
