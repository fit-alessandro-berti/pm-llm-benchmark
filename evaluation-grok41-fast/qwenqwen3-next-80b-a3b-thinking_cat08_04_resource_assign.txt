**9.8**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
This answer is exceptionally strong—nearly flawless in structure, depth, process mining grounding, actionability, and fidelity to the task—but deducts a tiny 0.2 for two minor issues: (1) hypothetical quantifications (e.g., "65% of 'Networking-Firewall' tickets misassigned," "195 hours delay") are presented as direct log-derived without explicitly noting they are illustrative extrapolations from the "conceptual" snippet (task implies analysis of full log but allows examples); this borders on over-precision without caveating as estimates. (2) Strategy 2's algorithm ("Assign to tier with lowest average AHT for the category, adjusted by agent availability") is slightly underspecified compared to Strategy 1's formula (no explicit equation), introducing minor unclarity in operationalization. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or omissions; all techniques (SNA, role discovery, etc.) are precisely applied to ITSM/resources; strategies are distinct/data-driven; simulation/KPIs are exemplary with table. Covers every subpoint exhaustively.
