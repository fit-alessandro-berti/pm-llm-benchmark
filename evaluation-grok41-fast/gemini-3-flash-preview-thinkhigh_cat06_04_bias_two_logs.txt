**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It correctly identifies **Group B's log** as exhibiting bias (the one manifesting the discriminatory adjustments absent in Group A's rigidly neutral log), with precise analysis of `LocalResident` (always TRUE in B, enabling boosts), `CommunityGroup` (conditional trigger for +10 "Community Boost" exclusively in B), and `ScoreAdjustment` (0 in A vs. +10 in B for club members). It demonstrates systematic differences via case comparisons (e.g., P002 at 710 rejected vs. U003 boosted from 695 to 705 approved, highlighting inconsistent standards despite 705 < 710; parallels like P001/U001 and P002/U002 underscore the boost's decisive favoritism). The threshold inference (720 standard from Group A data) is logically sound as a baseline, qualified by the data-driven paradox showing lowered bar for B, with no contradictions. Explanation of manifestations (sliding scale, proxy discrimination, affinity bias) is accurate, concise, and directly tied to evidence without speculation or unclarity. No inaccuracies, logical flaws, or omissions; structure enhances clarity. Perfect response to the question.
