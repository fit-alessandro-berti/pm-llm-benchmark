**10.0**

The query is flawless: it correctly identifies qualifying `case_id`s via aggregation (`GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`), performs an efficient inner join to retain only events from those cases (`SELECT el.*` preserves all columns), uses clean syntax (`USING (case_id)`), and includes an accurate comment. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, performance issues, or deviations from the requirements; fully compliant with standard SQL and DuckDB. Single-scan alternatives exist but are unnecessary for perfection here.
