**8.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**:
  - Primary solution (Solution 1) is **flawless**: Correctly uses subquery with `IN`, `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`, returns `e.*` (full events), and sensible `ORDER BY`. Matches prompt exactly.
  - Solutions 1, 3, and 4 are fully correct, return all columns (`*`), and handle "full set of events" perfectly.
  - Solution 4 (QUALIFY) is DuckDB-idiomatic and optimal, correctly recommended.
  - Test example data is accurate (case 1: 2 events 6 kept; case 2: 7 events >6 excluded).
  - Extras like performance notes, multiple approaches, and CTE breakdown add value without harming core task.
  - No syntax errors; all queries are valid DuckDB SQL.

- **Flaws (deductions, evaluated strictly)**:
  - **Major inaccuracy in explanation (significant deduction: -1.0)**: Primary breakdown states "**HAVING clause**: Filters to keep only cases with **6 events**" — this is **logically wrong**. SQL uses `<= 6` (six or fewer, per prompt), not exactly 6. Misdescribes the query's behavior; could mislead readers.
  - **Solution 2 incompleteness (moderate deduction: -0.5)**: SELECTs only `case_id, activity, timestamp` instead of `*`. Prompt specifies "full set of events" from a table with "**at least**" those columns — omits potential other columns (e.g., user_id). Does not return "full" events.
  - **Typos/unclarities in test comment (minor but penalized: -0.3)**: "(2 events **6**)" and "(7 events > 6)" — malformed ("2 events 6" unclear, likely meant "2 events 6"). Reduces clarity despite correct intent/data.
  - **Unrequested extras (minor deduction: -0.0)**: Prompt asks for "**a** DuckDB SQL query"; providing 4 + explanation/test is overkill but not wrong. However, strictly, benchmark likely expects concise single query.

- **Overall**: Nearly flawless core query (9.5+ level), but explanation error is a clear logical flaw, Solution 2 breaks completeness, and minor unclarities compound. 10.0 reserved for zero issues. 8.2 reflects excellence with strict penalties for inaccuracies.
