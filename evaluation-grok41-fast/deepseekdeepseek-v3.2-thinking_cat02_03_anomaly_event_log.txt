**10.0**

The provided answer is exemplary and flawless in its analysis. It systematically breaks down each case with precise sequence recaps, identifies all relevant anomalies (e.g., PO before approval in 1002, premature payment in 1003, goods before PO in 1004), and provides rigorous, accurate explanations grounded in standard P2P flows (requisition approval  PO  receipt  invoice  3-way match  payment). It correctly deems 1001 normal, highlights control risks (fraud, overpayment, unauthorized spending), and ends with a concise summary of broader implications. No inaccuracies, omissions, ambiguities, or logical flaws; structure is clear, comprehensive, and directly responsive to the task.
