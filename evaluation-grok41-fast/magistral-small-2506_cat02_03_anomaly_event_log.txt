**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical evaluation. It accurately identifies all key anomalies across Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 (no false positives or misses; Case 1001 implicitly normal by omission), with precise timestamp-based sequencing, correct invocation of P2P standards (e.g., requisition approval before PO, three-way match before payment), and rigorous explanations of risks (fraud, compliance, control failures). Structure is exemplary (sequences, bullet anomalies, risks, summary table), explanations are logically sound without speculation or overreach, and no inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws exist—even minor ones like phrasing in headings (e.g., "Late Invoice" in 1003 precisely ties to the core payment violation). Extraneous recommendations enhance without detracting.
