**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is strong overall—well-structured, directly addresses all three tasks, uses clear headings, precise timestamps, and logical explanations. It correctly identifies all major normative violations (Case 2's order reversal, skipped Inform Applicant, and improper Finalize Documentation) and desiderata issues across cases. Interpretations are balanced, offering plausible justifications without improperly excusing strict violations. However, under utmost strictness, several minor-to-moderate flaws warrant deductions (each costing ~0.2-0.8 points), as even small inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical gaps must significantly lower the score:

#### Strengths (Supporting High Base Score ~9.5+):
- **Task 1 (Normative)**: Flawless identification. Case 1/3 correctly no violations; Case 2 nails the three core issues (Risk before Credit with exact times; skipped Inform—critical catch not obvious; Finalize after reject). Aligns perfectly with "Key Normative Constraints" (e.g., ordering, no finalize post-reject).
- **Task 2 (Desiderata)**: Accurately flags no Follow-up Call (all cases), timings (Case 1 excellent, Case 3 delays calculated precisely at ~48h/~51h). Clarifies "suboptimal but not severe" repeatedly. Notes Case 2 overshadowed by normatives—prudent.
- **Task 3 (Interpretations)**: Provides case-by-case suggestions "in line with constraints" (e.g., backlog/holidays for Case 3 delays; clerical error for Case 2 finalize). Distinguishes justifications from excuses (e.g., "does *not* excuse").
- General: Tabular log faithfully referenced; language concise, bolded for clarity; no hallucinations.

#### Deductions (Strictly Penalized Flaws):
1. **Minor Inaccuracy in Timing (~0.2 deduction)**: Case 3 Credit Check " ~48 hours post-app (Jan 12 09:00 to Jan 14 10:00)". Precise calc: 49 hours 1 min (Jan12 09:00 to Jan14 09:00 = 48h; +1h to 10:00). "~48" is imprecise rounding-down; hypercritically, this understates the deviation slightly, risking user misinterpretation of severity.
2. **Logical/Clarification Flaw in Desiderata Case 2 (~0.4 deduction)**: Lists "No Inform Applicant at all (worse than late)" under desiderata (timing-focused). But absence is a **normative** violation (mandatory step), not a desiderata timing issue. This miscategorizes, blurring strict vs. soft distinctions despite "overshadowed" caveat—unclarity could confuse readers on rule hierarchy.
3. **Incomplete Normative Coverage in Case 2 (~0.3 deduction)**: Identifies Risk before Credit but omits that Credit Check occurs *after* Risk *and* immediately before Decision (09:00 post-08:20 Risk, pre-09:30 Decision). While encompassed, rules specify "Credit Check before any risk evaluation" and "Risk before Decision"—explicitly noting the sandwiched Credit as additional ordering absurdity would be more comprehensive. Feels slightly under-explained.
4. **Overreach in Interpretation (~0.3 deduction)**: Case 2 "Credit Check... logged late (e.g., system delay)". Plausible, but log explicitly timestamps Credit *after* Risk (09:00 > 08:20)—suggesting it was "initiated concurrently or informally *before*" requires assuming unlogged activity, bordering on speculation beyond "in line with given constraints" (no log/system evidence provided). Minor over-justification weakens objectivity.
5. **Minor Omission Across Desiderata (~0.2 deduction)**: Follow-up Call "encouraged... before closing" for all cases, but Case 1/3 explicitly note it while Case 2 implies via "No Follow-up Call"—consistent but could uniformly bold/flag as universal desideratum failure for symmetry.
6. **Style/Strictness Nit (~0.2 deduction)**: Phrases like "excellent (Credit Check ~30 min...)" and "Ideal execution" inject subtle praise not required by task (focus on violations/desiderata). Hypercritically, this adds unrequested subjectivity.

**Net**: Starts at 10.0, deduct ~1.6 for cumulative issues (no single fatal error, but "even minor issues significantly lower"). 9.2 reflects "very high but not nearly flawless" (flawless would require pixel-perfect precision, zero assumptions, exhaustive sub-violations). Still exemplary for real-world grading.
