The answer is flawless: the SQL query precisely meets the requirements using a correct CTE for per-case event counts, an efficient INNER JOIN to retain only qualifying cases, and a WHERE clause accurately filtering for `event_count <= 6`. It returns all events (`el.*`) from valid cases without extraneous data, handles grouping perfectly, and works in DuckDB (standard SQL). The explanation is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the query logic with no ambiguities, omissions, or errors. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws whatsoever.
