**9.7**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**: 
  - **Comprehensiveness**: Near-perfect coverage of all key areas from the process description (documentation, assignment criteria, meetings, inspections/repairs, marketing/pricing, screening/selection, leases/clauses, audits/checks, exceptions, communication, timing/sequencing, handoffs, roles/responsibilities). Includes decision points (e.g., prioritization in assignments/screening), exceptions (e.g., refusals, custom needs), and adaptations (e.g., conflicts, delays). Structured logically by stages for clarity.
  - **Open-Ended & Targeted**: All questions are genuinely exploratory (e.g., "how do you weigh...", "what happens if...", "can you give an example of..."), prompting elaboration on criteria, trade-offs, scenarios, and rationale without yes/no traps. Uses real-world hypotheticals tied to the description (e.g., luxury properties, repair refusals).
  - **Conceptual Focus**: Stays strictly process-oriented; no SQL, code, or vendor-specific implementation. Even tech-related questions (e.g., #10, #15) probe *how* tools support conceptual flow/dependencies, not mechanics.
  - **Clarity & Organization**: Clean, bulleted list with thematic sections mirroring process flow. Concise intro/outro reinforces intent without fluff.
  - **Depth**: Uncovers missing details (e.g., common issues, resolutions) and verifies sequencing/roles (e.g., handoffs, stakeholder conflicts).

- **Minor Deductions (Strict Hypercriticism – Preventing 10.0)**:
  - **Slight Leading Phrasing (0.1)**: A few questions imply assumptions (e.g., #10: "when communication breaks down" presupposes failures; #2: "might disqualify" suggests it happens). Not fatal, but subtly guides responses vs. purely neutral probing.
  - **Borderline Specificity/Tool Mentions (0.1)**: #10 & #15 reference "tools" or "CRMs/project management tools" (echoing description), but under "utmost strictness," this edges toward implementation adjacency despite conceptual framing. Prompt bans "implementation details," and while not violative, it's not 100% agnostic.
  - **Minor Scope Creep (0.1)**: #13 (learning/improvement) and #14 (stakeholder tensions) are excellent but slightly tangential to core "onboarding lifecycle" vs. explicit process steps; #12 extends to "post-activation" (valid handoff but post-process). Not inaccurate, but hypercritically, could trim for laser-focus.
  - No logical flaws, inaccuracies, repetitions, or unclarities; self-corrects any think-step issues (ignored per instructions).

This is exceptionally strong—flawless in 95%+ of aspects—but tiny imperfections prevent perfection under hypercritical lens.
