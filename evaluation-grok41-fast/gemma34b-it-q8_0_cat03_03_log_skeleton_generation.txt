**2.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Hypercritical Assessment)
- **Syntax Errors (Fatal, -4.0)**: `'equivalence'` value has invalid tuple syntax `{('Receive Order (RO)', 'Check Availability (CA))'}` (extra closing parenthesis), rendering the entire dict unparsable in Python. Code fails to execute.
- **Structural Completeness (-2.0)**: Keys are correct, but values are malformed or incomplete. Sets contain singletons instead of proper sets of tuples (e.g., `{('A','B')}` works but implies singleton set; still, no multi-constraint coverage).
- **Logical Accuracy of Constraints (-3.0)**:
  - `'equivalence'`: RO and CA are sequential (RO before CA), not equivalent (different occurrences/roles). Nonsensical.
  - `'always_before'`: ('CA', 'RI') wrongly implies RI *before* CA; scenario clearly has CA  RI. Inverted logic.
  - `'always_after'`: Partial (RI  PI ok-ish), but ignores chain (e.g., no PI  QC, PO  GSL  D, etc.).
  - `'never_together'`: Empty set ok, but no reasoning for potential exclusions (e.g., RP and D might co-occur).
  - `'directly_follows'`: Only one pair (RO  CA); misses obvious direct follows like CA  RI, PI  QC.
- **activ_freq Inaccuracies (-2.0)**: Arbitrary {1,2} for most (no scenario evidence for multiples; process implies single occurrences). RO {0,1} wrong (every case starts with RO per scenario). QC, IC, RP frequencies ungrounded; RP likely {0,1} (payment optional). All activities listed (good), but values flawed.
- **Scenario Coverage (-1.0)**: Ignores 70% of flow (e.g., no constraints for QC, PO, GSL, D, IC, RP sequencing/dependencies). IC/RP parallel to shipping? Unaddressed.
- **Extras (-0.5)**: Unnecessary `print()`; task asks for dict, not output.
- **Clarity/Unclarity (-0.5)**: Full activity names good, but no comments/explanation; assumes reader infers flawed logic.

Total base ~1-3 range; minimal credit for dict skeleton and partial naming. Far from "nearly flawless"—riddled with errors precluding usability.
