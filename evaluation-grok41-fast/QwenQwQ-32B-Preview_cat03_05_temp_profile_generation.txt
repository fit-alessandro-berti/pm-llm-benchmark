**8.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Output Only)
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**:
  - **Format and structure flawless**: Valid Python dictionary with tuple keys (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`) and value tuples `(avg, std)` in seconds. Clean code block as conclusion.
  - **Content completeness excellent**: 20 pairs forming a representative, complex subset (direct + multi-step indirect, e.g., `('SS', 'PT')` spans 5 steps, `('QI', 'PK')` spans 3). Covers full linear process order without invalid reverse pairs. Ensures "complexity by considering pairs... separated by multiple steps."
  - **Averages realistic and cumulative**: Times align with supply chain logic (e.g., procurement ~days/weeks: `OP-RC` 15d; manufacturing ~hours: `CA-PT` 6h; logistics variable). Most match sequential sums (e.g., `('SS', 'RC')` = 18d exactly, `('PT', 'DT')` = 2.125d precisely).
  - **Scale and units perfect**: Seconds throughout, sensible magnitudes (86400s=1d multiples common).

- **Flaws (strict deductions, each significant per instructions)**:
  - **Std dev modeling illogical/unrealistic (-1.0)**: Uniform 10% of avg (constant CV=0.1) for *all* pairs ignores statistical reality. For indirect pairs, std should accumulate as ~( vars) if independent steps (higher absolute std, lower *relative* std for longer chains). Uniform CV implies unrealistically *increasing* relative variability with chain length. Explicitly admits "set to 10%... to account for variability" – arbitrary, not "estimated" from process model/logs as required. Example in prompt has varied CVs (~4% vs 100%).
  - **Numerical inaccuracy in key entry (-0.5)**: `('SS', 'PT')`: (1700800, 170080) labeled "# 19.75 days" but 1700800/86400 19.686d (off by ~0.064d or 5,600s/1.55h). Own logic (SS-C A 19.5d + CA-PT 0.25d =19.75d 1,706,400s) mismatched. Minor but sloppy/unclear for "strictness."
  - **Over-simplification lacks nuance (-0.3)**: All stds exactly 10% (nice integers, e.g., 1555200155520), suggesting post-hoc fudging vs genuine estimation. Supply chain variability should differ (high for OP-RC lead times, low for CA-PT manufacturing).
  - **Minor unclarity (-0.0, not penalized further)**: Comments tie to days/% but don't add value; no logical break.

**Total: Starts at 10.0, deduct 1.8 for issues  8.2**. Strong fulfillment (structure/content 95%+), but std logic flaw + calc error prevent "nearly flawless" (9.5+). Better than average (handles estimation/ complexity well) but hypercritically imperfect.
