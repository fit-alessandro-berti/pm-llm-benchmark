**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Assessment)
This answer is strong in structure (clear sections, tables for readability, good separation of normative vs. desiderata), covers most violations accurately, provides appropriate justifications/interpretations (e.g., misconfiguration for Case 2, bottlenecks for Case 3), and aligns well with task parts 2 and 3 by clarifying desiderata as "minor/suboptimal" and suggesting plausible explanations. Summary table is effective. Timings are approximately correct (minor rounding errors like "~50 hours" vs. precisely 49 hours for Case 3 CC, or ">51 hours" vs. ~51.25 hours for Inform, but not egregious). Distinguishes severity well.

**Major Deduction (-2.0 to -3.0 equivalent):** Critical inaccuracy in Task 1 (normative violations). Completely misses that **Case 2 skips the mandatory "Inform Applicant" step entirely**, which violates the strict sequence ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; explicit sequence: Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [branch]  Close Case; "no skipping activities"). Log shows LD (Rejected) at 09:30 directly followed by Finalize (10:00)  Close (10:30), with no Inform logged. This is a severe normative skip, equivalent to the order violation and post-reject Finalize already noted. Listing only *two* violations instead of *three* makes the analysis incomplete and understates Case 2's failures. Claims Cases 1 & 3 "adhere perfectly" is accurate, but Case 2 analysis is flawed.

**Minor Deductions (-0.5 to -1.0 equivalent each, cumulative):**
- Desiderata table omits explicit row for **Case 2 Follow-up Call absence** (noted only in text as grouped with Case 1; inconsistent with per-case tabling for others, creating unclarity).
- Desiderata summary for Case 2 vaguely says "No specific timing check applicable" – timings *are* applicable and met (<24h CC, quick LDFinalize though invalid), but Follow-up should be tabled as minor like others.
- Justifications section slightly repetitive/overlaps tables (e.g., Case 2 normative details restated); minor redundancy.
- No explicit note that *all* cases lack Follow-up (implied but not synthesized in desiderata summary).
- Task 3 ("suggest interpretations... in line with constraints") is met for violators but sparse for compliant Case 1 (no interpretation offered, though none strictly needed).

**Strengths Not Sufficient for Higher Score:** Flawless would require 100% accurate violation ID (all 3 for Case 2), complete tables, precise timings, and maximal synthesis. Here, core task 1 miss prevents "nearly flawless" status. 7.0 reflects high quality with significant flaw (good enough for ~70% credit on strict rubric).
