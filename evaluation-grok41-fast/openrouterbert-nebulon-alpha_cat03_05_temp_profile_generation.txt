**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**:
  - Correct format: Valid Python dictionary with tuple keys `(earlier_activity, later_activity)` and tuple values `(avg_time_seconds, stdev_seconds)` as integers, matching the example precisely.
  - Representative subset with complexity: 21 pairs covering direct (e.g., `('RC', 'QI')`), short-range (e.g., `('CA', 'PT')`), and long-range cross-phase (e.g., `('SS', 'DT')`), fulfilling "ensuring complexity by considering pairs... separated by multiple steps." Good coverage across phases without exhaustive C(10,2)-style list (which would be ~45 ordered pairs but not required).
  - Realistic estimations: Times scale logically with supply chain phases (procurement days/weeks, manufacturing hours/days, distribution variable), using sensible seconds (e.g., 86400=1d, 3600=1h). Stdevs increase with distance/variability, appropriate for model.
  - Helpful extras: In-code comments, phased grouping, detailed rationale, and ZETA example add clarity/value without being required; demonstrate understanding.
  - No invalid pairs: All respect sequential order (SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS); no reverses or self-pairs.

- **Flaws/Deductions (strict, even minor issues penalized significantly)**:
  - **Major logical flaw: Non-additive times (primary deduction: -1.5)**: Averages should approximately satisfy transitivity/ additivity (avg(X,Z)   avg(intermediates)) since linear order and "temporal distances" over traces. Examples:
    | Chain | Sum from direct/short pairs | Direct long-range | Discrepancy |
    |-------|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
    | SSCA | SSOP(1d) + OPRC(6d) + RCQI(1d) + QICA(0.5d) = **8.5d** | **14d** | +65% |
    | SSQIPT | SSQI(8d) + QIPT(3d) = **11d** | OPPT=13d (but OP after SS); inconsistent baseline | ~20% off |
    | QIDT | QICA(0.5d) + CAPT(2d) + PTPK(1d) + PKWS(0.5d) + WSDT(2d) = **6d** | **10d** | +67% |
    | RCPK | RCQI(1d) + QICA(0.5d) + CAPT(2d) + PTPK(1d) = **4.5d** | **7d** | +55% |
    This undermines model integrity; long-range estimates seem arbitrarily inflated (perhaps for "realism") rather than derived consistently. Unacceptable for a "temporal profile" model.
  - **Minor incompleteness (-0.1)**: Subset misses some logical pairs (e.g., `('PT', 'DT')`, `('PT', 'AS')`, `('PK', 'AS')`, `('WS', 'AS')`) for fuller cross-phase representation, though "representative" allows it.
  - **Minor unclarities/typos (-0.1)**: Example deviation text has formatting error ("`OP`  `RC`"); bounds described accurately but phrasing "significantly lower/higher" matches prompt but could specify strict inequality.
  - **Minor overreach (-0.1)**: Extra content (rationale, example) excellent but prompt asks strictly to "Produce a Python dictionary"; bloat risks diluting focus, though not harmful.

- **Overall**: Near-excellent (base 9.5+), but additivity flaws are core logical inaccuracy for a temporal model, dropping to 8.2. Flawless would require consistent derivations (e.g., compute long-range as sums ± buffers) and zero nits.
