**4.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Summary
- **Strengths (limited)**: Correctly identifies core structure (columns match), uses `order_id` as Case ID, derives logical activity names (e.g., separate "Items Picked" per item is appropriate and granular), maps timestamps chronologically where shown (e.g., 1001 sequence is valid), enriches with partial resource lookups (e.g., sales/pickers/billers from Resources table), includes relevant attributes (e.g., quantity, amounts, notes). Handles multiple pickings well.
- **Major Flaws (severely penalizing)**:
  - **Incompleteness (fatal)**: Table is abbreviated with `...`, `**Note**`, and `**...**` placeholders instead of full rows for **all** events across **all** 5 orders. Misses ~70% of events: no full rows for 1003; 1002 shows only 1/2 dispatches, 0/2 invoices, 0/2 payments; 1004 partial + invented; 1005 entirely omitted. Violates "every event for every `order_id` is included" and "one row per event."
  - **Factual Inaccuracies**:
    - 1004 has **no Delivery record** (absent from table), yet invents "Order Dispatched" (wrong timestamp: copies DLV-5005's 2024-01-07T10:15:00Z) and "Order Arrived" (fabricated 2024-01-08T20:00:00Z, vaguely mimics DLV-5004). No basis in data—pure hallucination.
    - Wrong picker for 1004 ITEM-001: `WH-002` (Eva Johnson), not "David" (WH-001).
    - 1002 ignores 2nd delivery (DLV-5003: dispatch 2024-01-05T07:00:00Z, arrive 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z), 2nd invoice (INV-1003), 2nd payment (PAY-2003).
    - No events for 1003 (picking x2, dispatch/arrive DLV-5004, INV-1004, PAY-2004) or 1005 (picking x2, DLV-5005, INV-1005, PAY-2005).
    - 1004 dispatch note "-": Invents non-existent note.
  - **Chronological/Logical Errors**: Invented 1004 dispatch (2024-01-07) after real picking (01-06) is chronologically ok but illogical (no data supports dispatch).
  - **Resource Inconsistencies/Unclarities**: Partial names (e.g., "Alice" vs. full "Alice Brown"; "David" vs. "David Lin"); mixes names/codes (carriers as "CR-01" vs. resolved "GlobalTransport"); blanks ("-") for Arrived/Payment without justification. Optional but "recommended"—half-done is sloppy.
  - **Attribute Issues**: Invented data (e.g., 1001 Arrived "Destination: Customer location"—not in tables); redundant "Order ID: 1001" in attributes (already in Case ID).
  - **Formatting/Output Violations**: **Notes/ellipses** break Markdown table integrity (e.g., bolded note row for 1002 is invalid data row). Not a "structured table" with "each row... single event." No assumptions documented (e.g., why invent 1004 delivery? Why abbreviate?).
  - **Minor but Penalized**: No Products table integration (optional, but descriptions could enrich); inconsistent activity granularity (per-item picking good, but per-delivery dispatch needed analogously); no payment links explicit (e.g., via invoice_id).
- **Overall**: Demonstrates partial understanding but fails core requirements (completeness, accuracy, full table). Equivalent to a rough draft with errors—strictly 4.2 (mid-low: structure ~7/10, execution ~2/10). Flawless would be exhaustive, error-free table (~50-60 rows) with all links/timestamps/resources exact.
