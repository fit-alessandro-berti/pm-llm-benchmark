The response is exceptionally accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured. It precisely captures every key element of the diagram:
- Object types, instance counts, and starting points.
- Activity labels, colored dots (indicating object flows), and "Overall" volumes.
- Branching logic and flows (e.g., requisition approvals  Send Order/Check Stock/Process Return/Approve Payment  Create Invoice; sales order sequence; integrations from invoices/returns).
- Edge timings (ms annotations).
- End states and overall multi-object process summary.

No omissions, errors, or misinterpretations—it's a flawless description mirroring the visualization.
