**8.0**

### Rationale for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**:
  - **Completeness (perfect)**: All events included for all 5 orders (34 total rows): 5 "Order Created", 9 "Items Picked" (one per line item, meaningful granularity), 10 delivery events (2 per delivery record across 5 deliveries), 5 "Invoice Issued", 5 "Payment Received". No missing events; correctly handles incomplete cases (e.g., 1004 has only created + picked, no delivery/invoice/payment).
  - **Linking/Integration (perfect)**: Payments traced correctly via invoice_id to order_id (e.g., PAY-2003  INV-1003  1002).
  - **Activity Names (perfect)**: Logical and as suggested (e.g., "Items Picked" per item, separate "Dispatched"/"Arrived" per delivery).
  - **Timestamps (perfect)**: All exact from source data, no fabrication.
  - **Resources/Actors (perfect)**: Optional column used appropriately; IDs mapped accurately to names/roles from Resources table (e.g., SP-001  Alice Brown, WH-002  Eva Johnson, CR-01  GlobalTransport). Blank for payments (no data, correct).
  - **Other Attributes (excellent)**: Relevant data enriched as columns (e.g., item details from Products, delivery_note, invoice_amount, payment_method/reference, customer details for created). Sparse but correct (blanks where inapplicable). Redundancy in Resource/Carrier for deliveries minor/unpenalized.
  - **Assumptions (perfect)**: Documented clearly, logical (e.g., per-item picking, carrier as resource).
  - **Format (perfect)**: Markdown table, structured, readable.

- **Flaws (significant deductions, preventing 10/9)**:
  - **Chronological Order (major flaw, -2.0)**: Core requirement violated for case 1002. Events not sorted by timestamp within case: row order shows Dispatched (01-04 DLV5002)  Arrived (01-07 DLV5002)  Dispatched (01-05 DLV5003)  Arrived (01-08 DLV5003). Correct sequence must be Dispatched-04  Dispatched-05  Arrived-07  Arrived-08 (05-07:00 precedes 07-16:10). Distorts process flow for split shipments; event logs require per-case timestamp order for mining validity. Other cases correct, but one case fails "strictly chronological" and "reflects real process flow".
  - **Minor issues (slight deduction, -0.2 total)**: Delivery Resource/Carrier duplication redundant (unnecessary column overlap); no explicit note on 1004 incompleteness (though handled correctly, prompt requires documenting missing data). No unclarities, but not "nearly flawless".

Overall: Exceptional integration/effort (deserves base 10), but chronological inaccuracy is a critical logical flaw (directly undermines task). Hypercritical strictness demands deduction; flawless would have sorted rows by Case ID then Timestamp.
