**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless. It precisely identifies **Group B** as exhibiting bias, correctly attributes it to the explicit "+5 Association Boost" mechanism tied to "LocalBusinessLeadersClub" membership (absent in Group A), and demonstrates manifestation through clear evidence: intra-group disparity (U001/U003 vs. U002) and cross-group inequity (P002's superior raw scores—78/75/60—vs. U003's inferior 75/65/58 boosted to 63, resulting in hire vs. rejection). Implications are rigorously discussed, linking to meritocracy erosion, structural exclusion (Group A's non-local status precludes club access), disparate treatment favoring unprotected locals, and procedural/algorithmic bias risks. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical gaps; all claims are data-driven and tightly reasoned.
