The final output is a precise, numbered list of exactly 20 questions that fully adheres to the prompt: all are open-ended (starting with "How" or "What," prompting analysis rather than yes/no answers), thought-provoking (probing insights, issues like supplier failures/risks/stockouts, improvement strategies like diversification/JIT balancing, and implications like environmental/cost trade-offs), directly derived from the described process (covering suppliers, assembly, transport modes, JIT/monthly shipments, quality/compliance/recalls, analytics/forecasting, automation, sustainability, regulations, after-sales, e-commerce, etc.), with no SQL, no extraneous text, no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. Coverage is comprehensive and non-repetitive despite thematic breadth; each question is clear, relevant, and logically sound.
