**1.0**

This response is catastrophically incomplete and fails to address 100% of the task requirements. It merely restates a trivial, obvious method for calculating case duration (first minus last timestamp) without performing any actual calculations, identifying any specific cases (e.g., no mention of Case 2005 taking ~5 days vs. Case 2001's ~1.5 hours), or quantifying "significantly longer" with thresholds or comparisons. Sections 2 and 3 are entirely absent—no attribute analysis (e.g., Region B's High complexity cases like 2005 vs. A's), no correlations (e.g., Adjuster_Lisa's repeated requests in B/High), no explanations, and no mitigations. The structure teases a "step-by-step" breakdown but delivers nothing beyond a header and one unfinished sentence. Hypercritically, this is not an answer—it's a non-starter fragment with zero analytical value, riddled with the ultimate logical flaw: non-execution. Equivalent to submitting a blank exam page with a title. No credit warranted.
