### Evaluation Summary
This is an exceptionally strong response, nearly flawless in alignment with the prompt's requirements. It delivers a concise list of 10 targeted, open-ended questions that systematically probe the specified areas (missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, exceptions handling) without venturing into prohibited territory like SQL or implementation specifics. Questions are conceptual, interviewee-focused, and build directly on the described process to deepen understanding. Coverage is comprehensive and balanced:
- **Decision criteria**: Q2 (manager assignment), Q5 (tenant selection).
- **Roles/responsibilities**: Q2, Q6 (compliance), Q8 (tech roles).
- **Timing/sequencing**: Q1 (speed factors), Q10 (timeline/expectations).
- **Exceptions handling**: Q3 (repairs), Q7 (special cases).
- **Missing details**: Q4 (pricing), Q8 (tech usage), Q9 (feedback loops).

All questions are phrased invitingly (e.g., "How do you...", "Could you explain...", "What are some...") to elicit elaboration, reference process elements accurately (e.g., repairs, inspections, screening), and avoid redundancy.

### Hypercritical Deductions (Minor Issues Only)
- **-0.1 for Q1 phrasing**: "the speed at which *we* move forward" subtly shifts to first-person ("we") instead of neutral second-person ("you"), potentially blurring interviewer-interviewee dynamic; strictly, it should mirror the prompt's "their process" detachment.
- **-0.1 for Q9 scope creep**: Feedback "from landlords and tenants" logically extends onboarding (tenants post-onboarding), but tenants aren't core to the described *onboarding lifecycle*; it's a slight overreach beyond "the entire lifecycle of onboarding a property," though still relevant for process improvement.

No inaccuracies (all tie faithfully to description), unclarities (precise, jargon-free), or logical flaws (logical progression from intake to post-activation). No closed-ended questions, no off-topic elements. This merits a very high score; anything lower would be unjustified leniency in strictness.
