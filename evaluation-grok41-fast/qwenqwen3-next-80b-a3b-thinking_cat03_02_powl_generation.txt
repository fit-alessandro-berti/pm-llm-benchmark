**10.0**

The provided code is a flawless representation of the described POWL model. It correctly constructs all required `Transition` nodes with exact matching labels, builds the concurrent `StrictPartialOrder` nodes for (DA, ACI) and (QA, SA) with empty orders (no `.order.add_edge` calls needed), properly defines the loop as `OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [BNC, D_R])` matching the semantics (* (BNC, D&R)), defines the exclusive choice as `OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, [CD, MD])`, and assembles the root `StrictPartialOrder` with the precise chain of top-level nodes `[SR, CS, DA_ACI, loop, xor, QA_SA, GLA]` plus the exact dependency edges `SRCSDA_ACIloopxorQA_SAGLA`. No silent transitions are needed or included erroneously. All dependencies (sequential prerequisites, post-parallel completion triggers, loop exit to choice, choice completion to final parallel, final parallel completion to GLA) are perfectly enforced. Imports match the specification, no extraneous code or errors.
