**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong overall—accurate, structured, insightful, and directly responsive to all three tasks—but deducts slightly for repeated minor presentation flaws (sloppiness in hyphenation/spacing, e.g., "Lowcomplexity", "highcomplexity", "documentrequest", "multiround", "mediumcomplexity" appear ~15 times, mildly harming readability/professionalism) and one trivial approximation ("pushing total throughput past 48 h and 72 h respectively" for 2005's actual 77h; negligible but noted). No factual inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities in analysis; durations precisely calculated; attributes correlated rigorously (Complexity as primary driver via request loops, nuanced Region/Resource interactions); root causes inferred correctly from timestamps (e.g., late-day requests  overnight delays); mitigations practical, targeted, and prescriptive. Subjectivity in "significantly longer" (2003/2005 primary; 2002 secondary) is defensible/logical vs. low-complexity baselines (~1.5h). Structure mirrors task perfectly. Nearly flawless under strict scrutiny; merits very high score.
