The provided answer is a flawless execution of the task. It delivers a valid Python dictionary with keys as required tuples of activity labels and values as tuples of (average_time, standard_deviation) in seconds. It includes a representative subset (15 pairs) ensuring complexity via multi-step indirect pairs (e.g., ('SS', 'RC'), ('QI', 'DT'), ('SS', 'AS')) alongside direct ones, all logically consistent with the supply chain sequence. Estimates are plausible and scaled appropriately (short for quick internal steps like ('RC', 'QI'): 1 day avg ±0.5d; long for procurement/accumulation like ('OP', 'RC'): 14d ±3d, ('SS', 'AS'): 37d ±10d), with standard deviations increasing realistically for longer spans. Arithmetic is precise (e.g., 18×86400=1555200 verified across multiple entries). Comments enhance clarity without detracting. No syntax errors, no invalid pairs, no omissions of requirement coverage—fully meets "representative subset ensuring complexity."
