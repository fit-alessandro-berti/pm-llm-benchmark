**8.0**

### Reasoning for Grade
- **Strengths (pushing toward high score)**: Perfect format as a valid Python dictionary literal with correct tuple keys (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`) and value tuples `(avg, stdev)` in seconds. Includes a representative subset (~15 pairs) with good complexity: all 9 direct consecutive pairs + 6 non-consecutive (1-hop like `('SS', 'RC')`, multi-hop like `('RC', 'WS')`, `('CA', 'AS')`, full-span `('SS', 'AS')`). Estimates are realistic for supply chain (e.g., procurement ~10 days, manufacturing hours/days, support months). Most stdevs are plausibly smaller than avgs. Cumulative logic mostly holds (e.g., `('SS', 'RC')` exactly matches sum of directs `SS-OP + OP-RC`; `('OP', 'PT')`, `('QI', 'PK')` exact).
- **Weaknesses (strict deductions for inaccuracies/logical flaws)**:
  - **Calculation inconsistencies**: Non-consecutive avgs do not always align with sums of intervening direct avgs, undermining the "temporal profile" model (where time(A,C) avg should  sum avgs A-B + B-C in linear traces). Examples:
    | Pair | Listed Avg (sec) | Expected Sum of Directs (sec) | Error |
    |------|------------------|-------------------------------|-------|
    | `('RC', 'WS')` | 129600 (~1.5d) | 180000 (~2.1d) | -28% (missed ~0.6d) |
    | `('CA', 'AS')` | 8467200 (~98d) | 8114400 (~94d) | +4.4% (~4d off) |
    | `('SS', 'AS')` | 8942400 (~103d) | ~9165600 (~106d) | -2.4% (~3d off) |
    These are not "estimates" but detectable arithmetic errors given listed directs—logical flaw for a profile meant to model trace times accurately.
  - **Inline comments**: Unnecessary verbosity/explanation (e.g., "# 1 day avg..."), unlike clean example `{('A', 'B'): (86400, 3600), ...}`. Adds human-readable breakdowns not requested, slightly pollutes "pure" dictionary output.
- **Why not higher?** Hypercritical: Multiple quantifiable inaccuracies (even if minor %) + extras = not "nearly flawless." No unclarities, no syntax errors, no wrong activities, no zero/negative values.
- **Why not lower?** Core task fully met (complex subset, realistic estimates, valid syntax); flaws don't invalidate usability (std devs reasonable, overall progression logical).
