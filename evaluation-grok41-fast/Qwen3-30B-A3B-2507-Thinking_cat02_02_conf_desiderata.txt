**7.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (why not lower than 7.0)**: Excellent structure mirroring the task (sections 1-2 explicitly, interpretations included, tables for clarity/summary). Precise distinction between normative (strict) vs. desiderata (suboptimal, clarified as non-severe). Correct identification of Case 2 as *the* normative violator and Case 3 as desiderata-only. Accurate flagging/explanation of *two* key normative violations in Case 2 (sequence reversal, post-rejection finalize—directly matching log annotations). Perfect timings for Case 3 (49h/51h calculations flawless). Case 1 correctly perfect. Interpretations/justifications insightful and constraint-aligned (e.g., operational error, resource constraints). Takeaways actionable, reinforces distinction. Verbose think-tag ignored as instructed.
  
- **Flaws Penalizing to 7.0 (significant inaccuracies/logical gaps)**:
  1. **Major omission: Missed normative violation in Case 2 (skipping mandatory "Inform Applicant")**. Rules explicitly require "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome" *regardless of approve/reject* (pre-branch step; also listed in "Ordering Rules" and "Sequence"). Log shows `Decision (Rejected)  Finalize  Close`—clear *skip* of required activity ("What is Not Allowed: Skipping activities"). Answer shows this sequence in "Observed" but neither flags nor counts it as Violation #3. Wrongly states "2 violations" (summary/table); analysis incomplete. Hypercritical: Core task #1 demands *all* violations/reasons; this is a strict sequence skip, not "decision logic" alone.
  2. **Desiderata inaccuracy for Case 2**: Claims "Case 2 complies with desiderata" despite *no Inform ever* (violates "inform promptly within 48 hours of decision"—skipped = not within 48h). Even if overshadowed by normative issues, this contradicts "promptly inform" recommendation; logical flaw in blanket compliance claim.
  3. **Minor unclarities**: Interpretation for Case 2 says "*No valid justification exists*," but immediately speculates "system glitch/human misstep"—mild contradiction. Case 3 desiderata table labels "Very Low" for follow-up (unnecessary/subjective; task doesn't grade severity tiers). Takeaways imply Case 3 "requires no corrective action" (true) but suggest "process improvements" (good, but blurs "not serious" emphasis slightly).

- **Why not higher (not "nearly flawless")**: Inaccuracies are non-trivial (missed explicit rule violation + wrong count/compliance claim), undermining completeness for task #1/#2. Strict policy: "Any inaccuracies... significantly lower"; these prevent 9.0-10.0. Not 6.0 or below as bulk is precise/exemplary.
