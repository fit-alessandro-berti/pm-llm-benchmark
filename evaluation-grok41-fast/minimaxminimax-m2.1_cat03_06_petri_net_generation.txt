**4.0**

### Reasoning for Grade
The final code provides a structurally ambitious attempt to model the process using pm4py, with correct imports, place/transition creation, arc utilities, and initial/final markings (`im` with token in "Start", `fm` with token in "End"). The DV/RDS loop is logically sound (after RDS loops back to "After CR"  DV  "After DV", allowing multiple DV executions). The conditional AP is well-modeled (fork from "After CA" to either AP  P or direct "P"-labeled transition to "After P", merging at "After P"). Sequential parts (C  CR  DV  ... P  N  CL  End) are mostly connected.

However, under utmost strictness, multiple critical logical flaws and inaccuracies prevent a higher score:

- **Breaking omission (cannot complete main path)**: No arc from `transitions['FC']` to `places['after_fc']`. FC consumes token from "After DV" but produces nothing, dead-ending the token. Cannot reach CA/AP/P/N/CL from normal DV-complete path. Process cannot reach final marking without infinite DV looping.
- **Broken FC/II loop**: After II  "After FC", token at "After FC" can loop to II or go to CA, but cannot re-fire FC (FC inputs only from "After DV", unreachable). Models multiple *II* but not multiple FC  II cycles as described ("between FC and II ... multiple times"). Semantically incorrect.
- **Unused/dangling transitions**: Defines `DV_to_FC`, `FC_to_CA`, `CA_to_AP`? No—`CA_to_AP` is used, but `DV_to_FC`, `FC_to_CA` have no arcs (added to net unnecessarily, cluttering model).
- **Semantically odd auxiliary labels**: Loop transitions labeled with prior activities (e.g., `RDS_to_CR` labeled "CR"—re-registers claim after RDS? `II_to_FC` labeled "FC"—performs FC after II without input token). Violates "transitions labeled with the activity names" intent; misrepresents process.
- **Minor unclarities/inconsistencies**: Redundant "P"-labeled transitions (acceptable but adds nondeterminism); no explicit "Before FC" but direct FC input works partially; comments reference unused arcs (e.g., "DV to FC transition to After FC?"); code has repetitive comments but executes.

These are not minor—core paths/loop fail to fire properly, violating accepting net requirement (reachable final marking via described flows). Not "nearly flawless"; substantial rewrites needed (add FC output, fix FC loop input, prune unused, relabel auxiliaries). 4.0 reflects partial functionality (DV loop + AP conditional work) but penalizes breaking flaws heavily.
