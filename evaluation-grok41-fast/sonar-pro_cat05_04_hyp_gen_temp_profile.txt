7.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (why not lower):**
- **Task Coverage (Perfect):** Fully addresses all 3 tasks independently without referencing instructions. Identifies exactly the 4 key anomalies from the profile (R-P low STDEV, P-N long/high var, A-C quick, E-N too fast). Hypotheses are plausible, aligned with prompt suggestions (automation, backlogs, skipping steps). Queries target specific claims, correlate with claim_type/resource/region/adjusters as prompted.
- **Structure & Clarity (Excellent):** Logical per-anomaly format with hypothesis + query. Concise summary. Times/ranges in queries match profile (e.g., 24-26h for ~25h avg/1h SD; >5d for 7d avg; <3h for 2h avg; <10min for 5min avg).
- **SQL Intent (Strong):** Uses correct Postgres syntax (INTERVAL, MAX(CASE WHEN), timestamp subtraction  interval, HAVING for filtering). Innovative additions like NOT EXISTS for skipping steps (A-C query). Correlates as prompted (e.g., region, claim_type, resource).

**Flaws (Major Deductions - Hypercritical):**
- **SQL Inaccuracies/Invalidity (Severe, -2.0):** 
  - Query 1: **Broken - No JOIN to `claims`**. `claim_type` in SELECT/GROUP BY/HAVING but sourced from non-joined `claims` table  runtime error ("column c.claim_type does not exist"). Cannot execute.
  - Query 4: **Logical flaw in GROUP BY**. Groups by `ce.resource` (varies per event/claim), splitting per-claim times into resource-subgroups. Distorts MAX(E)-MAX(N) if E/N by different resources; SELECT `ce.resource` ambiguous. Should GROUP BY only `claim_id`/`claim_type` for per-claim analysis.
- **SQL Dubious Assumptions/Flaws (Significant, -0.6):**
  - All queries: Assumes exactly one event per activity per claim (MAX fine if multiples rare, but unstated; risks wrong if duplicates).
  - Query 2: JOIN `adjusters` on `ce.resource = a.name` flawed. `resource` (VARCHAR, generic "resource performing activity")  guaranteed `adjuster.name`; could be system/email/etc. Groups by `a.region` but mixes resources across claim events  wrong attribution (e.g., region's from Notify event, not Assign). Should link via Assign event's resource or `adjuster_id` (missing in schema).
  - Query 2/4: SELECT `ce.resource`/`a.region` without aggregation  arbitrary value per group if multiples.
  - Query 3: Minor - `c.claim_amount` in GROUP BY unnecessary (per-claim unique), bloats.
- **Unclarities/Edge Cases (Minor but penalized, -0.2):** No handling for missing activities (NULL intervals skipped by HAVING, ok but unmentioned). No Z-score calc (prompt implies deviation check, but ranges approximate well-enough).
- **Logical Gaps (Minor, -0.0 extra):** Hypotheses good but generic/not deeply tied to schema (e.g., no customer_id/region hypotheses despite prompt). No broader queries (e.g., aggregate stats to validate profile).

**Why 7.2 (Not 10/9):** 85% flawless (structure/content), but SQL bugs prevent reliable verification (core task)  not "nearly flawless." Query 1 unexecutable, others unreliable in real data. Hypercritical: Functional SQL mandatory for 9+; good-but-broken = mid-7s.
