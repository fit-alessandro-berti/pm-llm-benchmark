**9.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
**Strengths (justifying high base score):**
- **Complete coverage**: All 11 low-level events per case are grouped without overlap, omission, or invention. Applies consistently to both A1 and B2 (identical sequences).
- **Logical groupings**: Coherent phases based on temporal proximity (e.g., prep events ~15s spans, welding ~10s), resource patterns (e.g., Operator A/Robot/Heating  Operator B  Sensor  Units  Operator C), and domain logic (prep  transform  verify  finish  inspect). Matches prompt example style (e.g., prep includes handling/positioning/prep).
- **Justifications**: Detailed per group, citing sequence, resources, phases, and domain relevance. Repeated across sections for clarity (table, summary, JSON).
- **Naming**: Domain-relevant (e.g., "Material Preparation," "Surface Finishing"); descriptive and intuitive.
- **Structure**: Exceeds prompt with table + JSON + sections; JSON is parseable and precise. Makes workflow "at a glance" clear.
- **Inference**: Correctly derives general rules from subset without case-specific tables (unneeded, as patterns identical).

**Flaws/Deductions (strictly penalizing minor issues):**
- **-0.3**: "Pick up welding tool" in "Welding / Assembly" is marginally illogical—it's tool acquisition (prep-like, akin to "Retrieve raw metal sheet"), not core assembly/transformation. Welding starts at "Weld corner A." Rationale ("signals the start") is hand-wavy; better as separate micro-prep or with welds only. Minor logical stretch.
- **-0.2**: Name "Welding / Assembly" inconsistent/unclear—log is pure welding (spot welds on sheet corners, no multi-part assembly evident); "Assembly" overgeneralizes, risking confusion. Pure "Welding" or "Frame Welding" tighter.
- **-0.2**: Single-event groups ("Weld Quality Verification," "Final Inspection") justified but underdeveloped—could note why not merged (e.g., automated vs. human, weld-specific vs. holistic). Prompt favors "coherent stage," but singles feel thin despite logic.
- **-0.1**: Redundancy: Rationales repeated verbatim-ish across sections 1/3/JSON (e.g., Welding rationale near-identical). Bloated; concise version sufficient.
- **No major inaccuracies/unclarities**: Timestamps/resources/AdditionalInfo implicitly respected (e.g., no cross-case mixing). No logical gaps in flow.

**Overall**: Near-flawless (exceptional depth/structure), but minor logical imprecisions (tool grouping/name) and bloat prevent 10.0. Scores 9.5+ only for zero-nitpick perfection.
