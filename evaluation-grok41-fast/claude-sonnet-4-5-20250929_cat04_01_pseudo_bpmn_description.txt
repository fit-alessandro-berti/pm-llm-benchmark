The response is exceptionally comprehensive, precise, and faithful to the pseudo-BPMN diagram. It meticulously covers every required element: purposes of all steps (with accurate inferences where BPMN is high-level), gateway meanings (types, logic, and outcomes), path divergences/convergences (e.g., early termination for infeasible custom, synchronization at AND join, convergence at post-path approval XOR), standard vs. custom differences (via detailed sections and table), and triggers for approvals/rework (reasonably inferred with examples, without fabricating unsupported facts). Structures like numbered steps, tables, and summaries enhance clarity without introducing fluff. No inaccuracies, logical flaws, ambiguities, or omissions—paths, loops (path-specific returns to D/E1, iterative until exit), and optimizations align perfectly. Minor elaborations (e.g., example thresholds) are explicitly qualified as typical/business-rule-based, fitting an explanatory analysis. Flawless under hypercritical scrutiny.
