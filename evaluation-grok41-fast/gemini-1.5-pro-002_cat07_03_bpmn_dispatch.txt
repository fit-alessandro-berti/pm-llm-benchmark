9.3

**Rationale:**
- **Strengths (excellent coverage):** Accurately identifies swimlanes, start/end points, major steps, decision logic (e.g., special handling bypassing/skipping insurance correctly), flow merges, Warehouse delay/notify logic, and all symbol types with precise explanations. Structure by department mirrors the diagram effectively. Comprehensive and well-organized breakdown.
- **Minor weaknesses (-0.7 deduction):** 
  - Introduces a non-existent "Clarify Shipment Method" step early in Secretary (diagram flows directly from "Ship goods" oval to "Special Handling?" diamond).
  - Slightly loose phrasing on Warehouse trigger (implied parallel but actually sequential from Logistics "Select... Place Order"  "Package Goods").
  - Treats "Notify Customer about Delay" diamond as a process bullet rather than explicitly calling it a decision (though interpretation is correct).
- Overall: Highly accurate (~95%), insightful symbol analysis as bonus, no major errors or omissions. Near-perfect for grading an image description task.
