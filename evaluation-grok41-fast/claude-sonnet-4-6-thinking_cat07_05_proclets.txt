**10.0**

The provided answer is an **exceptional, precise, and comprehensive description** of the image. It accurately captures every key element across all three parts (a)-(c) with no factual errors, excellent structure (using tables and bullet points for clarity), and a concise yet informative summary. Minor phrasing (e.g., combining "Receive result Judge results" into one cell) mirrors the image's layout without losing meaning, and all details like multiplicities, actors, flows, decisions, channels, UML notation, and the performative message table are spot-on. Perfect fidelity to the visualization.
