**3.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Major Omissions (Severe Penalty: -4.0)**: Entirely missing **order 1005** (creation, 2x Item Picked [ITEM-007 q10, ITEM-002 q2], Delivery DLV-5005 dispatch/arrival, INV-1005 Invoice Issued, PAY-2005 Payment Received). Prompt mandates "every event for every `order_id`"; Orders table explicitly includes 1005. This alone disqualifies perfection.
- **Data Mapping Inaccuracies (Severe Penalty: -2.0)**: 
  - Order 1003: Falsely assigns ITEM-007 q10 (belongs to 1005); only ITEM-002 q1 and ITEM-006 q3 exist for 1003.
  - Order 1002: Missing 2nd Invoice Issued (INV-1003 2024-01-10T11:00:00Z, amount 100, BL-002) despite "every event" rule and plural "event(s)" guidance.
  - Order 1004: Invents non-existent Invoice Issued (no INV for 1004; INV-1004 is 1003's) and wrongly assigns PAY-2004 (belongs to 1003's INV-1004).
  - Payment details wrong (e.g., 1003's PAY-2004 listed as "Check REF-CH-789" but data is "Credit Card REF-CC-456").
- **Chronological Flaws (Major Penalty: -0.5)**: Within-case listing not strictly timestamp-ordered (e.g., 1002: INV-1002 at 2024-01-08T10:15 before final Arrived 2024-01-08T20:00; sortable but violates "chronological correctness" and "real process flow"). Interleaving ignored in grouped presentation.
- **Logical/Resource Issues (Moderate Penalty: -0.3)**: Resources good (full names used), but payments consistently lack resource (fine per optional, but inconsistent "—" vs. others). Other Attributes vague/incomplete (e.g., "invoice_issue_date" redundant; missing delivery_note, carrier notes).
- **Positives (Partial Credit: Base ~5.0 then deducted)**: Correct structure (Markdown table, columns match), most events for 1001-1003 partially accurate, resources enriched properly where applicable, notes document some assumptions (e.g., 1004 invoice ambiguity).
- **Overall**: ~60% accurate coverage with cascading errors in linking (invoices/payments to orders). Not "nearly flawless"; significant for process mining (wrong cases/events distort traces). Strict scale demands 10.0 only for zero issues.
