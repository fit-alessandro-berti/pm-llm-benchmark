**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: Excellent structure mirroring the task's 3 parts. Precise identification of Case 2 as the *only* normative violator (correct; Cases 1/3 clean). Accurate flagging of the two *highlighted log violations* (Risk before Credit Check; Finalize after rejection) with direct quotes from constraints. Clear distinction between normative (strict) vs. desiderata (suboptimal). Case 3 desiderata analysis spot-on (timing calcs mostly accurate, severity clarified). Justifications interpretive and balanced. Summary table concise/effective. No logical flaws in non-violative cases; overall clarity and completeness ~90%.
- **Fatal Flaws (significant deductions; not "nearly flawless")**:
  1. **Major inaccuracy/omission in Task 1 (normative violations)**: Case 2 *skips "Inform Applicant"* entirely (log: Decision at 09:30  Finalize at 10:00  Close at 10:30; no Inform). This violates **explicit rules**: "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision"; "no skipping activities." Answer lists *only 2 violations* (misses this third), undercounts in explanations/table ("2 violations"). This is a core sequence skip, not "fundamentally broken" handwaving—requires explicit identification/explanation. Heavy penalty (-1.5).
  2. **Inconsistency in Task 2 (desiderata)**: Follow-up Call "encouraged" for *all* cases pre-close, yet absent in *all logs* (Case 3 explicitly notes; others implied). Case 1 deemed "meets all desiderata" (incorrect—fails this); Case 3 flags it (inconsistent). Trivial per rules but task requires *identifying failures* across cases. Minor but per instructions, "even minor issues significantly lower" (-0.3).
  3. **Minor unclarities/phrasing**: Case 3 Credit Check "~49 hours" called ">48 hours (vs. 24 hours)"—accurate numerically but confuses rec (24h) with stated threshold (48h); reads as imprecise. No justification for Case 1's perfect desiderata despite missing Follow-up. No suggestion for Case 2's *third* violation (-0.2).
- **Why not lower?** Structure/language professional; covers *most* violations/reasons; desiderata severity perfectly clarified; suggestions aligned. 7.2 reflects "very good but critically incomplete" (flawless would flag all 3 violations explicitly, consistent desiderata across cases).
