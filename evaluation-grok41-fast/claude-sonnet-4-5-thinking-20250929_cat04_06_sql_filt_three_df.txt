The provided answer is flawless. Both primary solutions (LEAD window function and ROW_NUMBER self-joins) precisely capture consecutive events in the sequence via direct succession checks (immediate LEAD offsets or rn+1 joins), apply the exact timing filter (>5 days between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'), identify qualifying cases with DISTINCT, and correctly exclude all events from those cases only via NOT IN. Handles multiples/edges perfectly (NULL LEADs fail safely, DISTINCT dedups cases). DuckDB syntax is correct (INTERVAL arithmetic preferred and precise). Final output returns all columns/events ordered properly. Explanations are accurate/crisp. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, inefficiencies, assumptions beyond prompt norms, or logical gaps.
