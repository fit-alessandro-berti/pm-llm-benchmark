**9.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (Near-Flawless Aspects)**:
  - **Completeness**: All events from all tables are included exhaustively (e.g., every order line as separate "Item Picked" event, every delivery as separate Dispatch/Arrived pair, every invoice/payment). Order 1004 correctly limited to available data. All order_ids (1001-1005) covered.
  - **Case ID**: Perfectly uses `order_id`.
  - **Activity Names**: Logically derived and match prompt examples (e.g., "Order Created", "Item Picked", "Order Dispatched", "Order Arrived", "Invoice Issued", "Payment Received"). Granular per item/delivery/invoice/payment is meaningful for process mining.
  - **Timestamps**: 100% accurate, copied verbatim, chronological within each case (verified all sequences, e.g., 1002 dispatches before arrivals, pickings before dispatches).
  - **Resources/Actors**: Excellently enriched using Resources Table mappings (e.g., SP-001  Alice Brown, CR-01  GlobalTransport). Creative but justified use of `payment_method` for payments (documented; optional column handled well).
  - **Other Attributes**: Structured as dedicated columns (e.g., Item ID/Quantity, Delivery ID/Note, Invoice ID/Amount, Payment ID/Method/Reference, Customer details). Highly relevant, no extraneous data; blanks are appropriate (no forced fills).
  - **Output Format**: Perfect Markdown table, sorted by Case ID then Timestamp. Assumptions explicitly documented pre-table and in notes.
  - **Chronological Correctness**: Flawless per case; reflects real flow (e.g., no arrivals before dispatches).

- **Minor Deductions (Strict/Hypercritical Lens – Costing 0.5 Points Total)**:
  - **Amount in Payment Rows**: Copied from linked invoice (correct inference), but Payments table lacks explicit payment_amount (could be partial; data implies full but not stated). Minor assumption not over-documented (e.g., no caveat on partials), though overall assumptions section covers it.
  - **Invoice ID in Payment Rows**: Useful linking, but technically an "other attribute" from join; table has both Invoice ID and Payment ID columns, which is redundant for pure payment events (minor bloat, though functional).
  - **No Explicit Carrier ID Column**: Resource uses mapped name (good), but raw carrier_id omitted (negligible, as name suffices; prompt doesn't require IDs).
  - **No Products Integration**: Optional table ignored entirely (fine, but "if available" – descriptions could enrich Item Picked; zero penalty alone).
  - **Table Width/Clarity**: 16 columns with many blanks is comprehensive but visually dense in Markdown (minor usability nit; still structured as required).

This is exceptionally high-quality – comprehensive, accurate, process-mining-ready. Only hypercritical nits prevent 10.0; any real-world use would be flawless.
