**7.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Summary:
- **Strengths (supporting higher score):** Perfect structure mirroring the task's 3 parts. Correctly identifies Case 2 as the sole normative violator and Case 1 as flawless. Accurately flags the two explicit normative violations in Case 2 (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection). Appropriately qualifies desiderata failures as "not severe" and "suboptimal." Case 3 desiderata analysis mostly correct (delays and no Follow-up Call). Interpretations are reasonable and "in line" with prompt. Clear, concise writing.
- **Major flaws deducting points (strict deduction):** 
  - **Incomplete normative analysis (critical inaccuracy, -1.5):** Case 2 skips "Inform Applicant" entirely—a strict mandatory step ("must be informed" after Decision; sequence explicitly requires Decision  Inform  Close for reject). This is a clear sequence skip/"skipping activities not allowed," equivalent in severity to the flagged violations. Not mentioned at all.
  - **Factual error in desiderata timing (-0.8):** Inform Applicant in Case 3 is ~51 hours after Decision (Jan 14 12:00 to Jan 16 15:00), not "around 75 hours." Miscalculation (possibly from Application Received) undermines precision; even minor math errors count heavily under "hypercritical."
  - **Minor logical inconsistency (-0.3):** Claims Case 1 adheres to "all...desiderata," but log shows no Follow-up Call (encouraged desideratum, like Case 3). Implicitly treats it as met without justification, stretching "adhering."
  - **Minor unclarities (-0.2):** Interpretations for Case 2 note out-of-order Credit Check as "to rectify" but ignore it occurred *before* Decision (partial fix, but still violates Risk ordering). Case 2 desiderata/timing not addressed (though secondary to normative fails).

Overall: Strong but not "nearly flawless"—key omission and error prevent 9+; 7.2 reflects ~85% accuracy under utmost strictness (major miss = significant penalty, minors compound).
