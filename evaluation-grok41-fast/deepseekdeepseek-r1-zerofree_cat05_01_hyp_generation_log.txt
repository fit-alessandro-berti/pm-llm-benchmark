The final output consists of five well-structured, syntactically correct PostgreSQL queries that effectively target key sequence-based anomalies (premature shipping/confirmation/payment relative to prerequisites, missing steps via COALESCE logic, activity sequences by order type, and resources in example anomalous cases). Comments clearly describe the purpose, implicitly identifying relevant anomalies and aligning with process flow deviations in the data (e.g., cases 1002–1004). Joins to `orders` and `resources` are appropriately used. Logic handles missing events robustly, and STRING_AGG provides diagnostic sequences.

Minor deductions for: (1) hardcoded `IN (1002, 1003, 1004)` in query 5, limiting generality—instead, dynamically select anomalous cases via subquery; (2) no queries probing `additional_info` (e.g., `shipment_scheduled=N` yet shipped, low `credit_score` proceeding, early/late flags), missing data-specific anomalies; (3) no coverage for other out-of-sequence issues like "Issue Invoice" before "Confirm Shipment"/"Ship Goods" (e.g., case 1003). These are small gaps but notable under hypercritical scrutiny; output remains highly relevant and nearly comprehensive for sequence violations.
