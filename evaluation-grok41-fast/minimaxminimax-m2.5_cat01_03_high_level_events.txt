The answer is exemplary and fully meets all requirements with zero inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. It precisely covers every low-level event across both cases without omission or overlap, uses domain-relevant names, provides cogent justifications blending logical sequence, resource consistency, temporal proximity, and process phase coherence, and delivers a perfectly structured table plus summary. Single-event groups are appropriately treated as distinct high-level steps (e.g., inspections), aligning with the prompt's examples and emphasis on coherent stages. The output directly achieves the goal of simplifying the workflow.
