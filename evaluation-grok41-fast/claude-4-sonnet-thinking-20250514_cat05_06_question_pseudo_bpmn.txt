**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (near-flawless content)**: Exactly 20 questions, all open-ended (starting with "What," "How," "Why"), directly tied to the pseudo-BPMN (e.g., parallel gateways for sourcing/shipping/distribution, exclusive gateways for quality/demand, specific locations like Malaysia/Taiwan/Japan). Covers core prompt areas comprehensively: rationale (Q1-2), improvements (Q2,16-17,20), risk management (Q3-5), decision-making (Q6-7), stakeholder communication (Q8-9), performance measurement (Q10-11). Thought-provoking depth (e.g., geopolitical risks, KPIs per stage). Expands intelligently to related themes (tech, sustainability) without straying. No SQL, no inaccuracies, no logical flaws—each question logically probes the diagram's flows.
- **Minor Deductions (strict penalties)**:
  - **Format violation (-0.5)**: Prompt specifies "just list the questions." Response adds unnecessary preamble ("Here are 20...") and bold category headers (e.g., "**Process Design & Rationale:**"), introducing extra non-question text/structure. This is a clear, if minor, deviation from "just list."
  - **Uneven/forced categorization (-0.2)**: Headings are helpful but unrequested; grouping is inconsistent (e.g., 2 questions in most, 3 in Risk, 1 in final), slightly disrupting pure list flow.
  - **Slight overreach in scope (-0.1)**: Questions like Q12-15,18 (tech/sustainability/competition) are excellent but drift from prompt's exact list ("rationale...performance measurement"), adding ~30% extraneous themes despite fitting broadly.
- **Overall**: Exceptionally strong (flawless on substance/metrics), but format nitpicks prevent perfection under hyper-strict criteria. No major issues; scores 9.0+ only for near-flawless execution.
