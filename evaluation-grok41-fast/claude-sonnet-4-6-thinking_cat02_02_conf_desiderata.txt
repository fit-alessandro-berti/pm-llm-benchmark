**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—structured, comprehensive, precise, and directly addresses all task components with clear tables, explanations, and balanced coverage of normative vs. desiderata. It correctly identifies **only Case 2** as normatively violating (with exact 3 violations: Risk before Credit, Finalize after Reject, skipped Inform—all accurately evidenced from log). Desiderata analysis correctly flags failures per case, emphasizes "not severe/suboptimal," and covers timings accurately (e.g., Case 3's ~49h/51h calcs are exact). Part 3 provides plausible, constraint-aligned justifications without excusing violations. Summary table is flawless synthesis.

**Minor Deductions (Strict/Hypercritical):**
- **Factual inaccuracies in Part 3 (Case 3 interpretations; -0.5 total):** 
  - Jan 14, 2024, is Sunday (not "Monday"). 
  - Jan 16, 2024, is Tuesday (not "Wednesday"). 
  These are clear calendar errors, undermining the "weekend justification" credibility despite correct hour calcs and plausible logic. Hypercritical: any inaccuracy, even in interpretive "suggestions," flaws perfection.
- **Minor unclarities/omissions (-0.3 total):**
  - Case 2 desiderata: Only notes "no Follow-up Call"; overlooks that absent Inform inherently fails "prompt inform within 48h" desideratum (though correctly escalated to normative—still incomplete coverage).
  - Case 2 log has Credit Check ~1h post-Application (<24h), unmentioned (minor, as overshadowed).
  - Follow-up Call absence inferred correctly for Cases 1/2 (log-implicit), but Case 3 explicitly noted—slight inconsistency in emphasis.
- No logical flaws, no missed violations, no normative misreads (e.g., correctly requires Inform post-Decision regardless of outcome).

**Why Not 10.0?** Not "nearly flawless"—documented inaccuracies exist.  
**Why Not Lower?** Errors are confined to non-core interpretation; core analysis (violations/desiderata IDs, evidence, timings) is impeccable/verbatim-log-accurate. No skips, no inventions, superior clarity. Equivalent to 92% perfection under utmost strictness.
