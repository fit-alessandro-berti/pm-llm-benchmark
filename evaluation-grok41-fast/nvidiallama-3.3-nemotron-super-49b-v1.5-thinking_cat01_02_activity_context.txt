**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**:
  - Correctly identified all intra-case recurrences: "Verify Documents" (C001, C003) and "Call Customer" (C002).
  - Revised log format mirrors original closely, with clear separation per case and all columns intact.
  - Renames for *recurring* activities are contextually accurate and disambiguating:
    - C001 "Verify Documents": "Initial Document Verification"  initial check; "Re-verification After Additional Docs"  post-submission recheck (perfect match to clues).
    - C002 "Call Customer": "Account Discrepancy Clarification Call"  discrepancy clarification; "Adjustment Confirmation Call"  post-adjust confirmation (precise).
    - C003 "Verify Documents": "Physical ID Verification"  branch physical check; "Post-Adjustment Document Recheck"  post-adjust reverify (spot-on).
  - Justifications tie directly to "Additional Context" clues, with bullet-point clarity.
  - "Key Improvements" adds value without fluff.

- **Flaws/Inaccuracies Penalized (strict deductions)**:
  - **Inaccurate naming (major -1.5)**: C001 "Call Customer" (non-recurring, single instance) renamed "Account Clarification Call", but context is *document request* ("request missing docs"), not account-related like C002. This mismatches context; sloppy copy-paste from C002 feel.
  - **Over-renaming non-recurring activities (-1.0)**: Task specifies "activities that appear multiple times *within the same case*" and "for each activity that recurs". Yet renamed:
    - All singles: C001/C003 "Call Customer", C002 "Verify Documents", "Submit Additional"  "Submit Additional Documents", C003 "Initiate Request"  "Initiate Request (Walk-in)".
    - Justifications explicitly cover non-recurring "Initiate Request" (#3) — violates task scope.
  - **Inconsistencies/unclarities (-0.3)**: "Initial Document Verification" used for C001/C002 first Verifies (good pattern) but not C003 ("Physical ID Verification") — logical but uneven. C001 call name shorter/inconsistent with C002 ("Account Clarification" vs. "Account Discrepancy Clarification").
  - **Minor formatting/verbosity (-0.0, neutral)**: Separate tables fine; names slightly verbose but descriptive.

Nearly comprehensive/good for recurring focus (8.5+ base), but inaccuracies, scope creep, and mismatches drop it firmly mid-high. Flawless would rename *only* recurrences with zero extras/errors.
