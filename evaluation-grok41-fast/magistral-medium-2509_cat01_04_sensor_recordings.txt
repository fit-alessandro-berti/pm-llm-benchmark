The final answer is nearly flawless: it precisely groups all 15 events into coherent, sequential phases (Idle: 1-3,13-15; Cutting Metal: 4-6; Assembling Parts: 7-8; Welding: 9; Quality Inspection: 10; Packaging: 11-12) that align perfectly with sensor patterns and timestamp progression. Labels match the prompt's examples exactly while adding a logical "Idle" phase. Rationales are specific, data-driven (citing exact sensor values/trends like peak pressure for Assembling, zero flow/high heat for Welding), and explain deductions intuitively without contradictions. The table provides a clear, comprehensive summary. Transitions form a realistic manufacturing sequence (Idle  Cut  Assemble  Weld  Inspect  Package  Idle) with tool position progression (05-10151515200). No events unassigned, no overlaps, no inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws—even the Quality Inspection rationale fits as a low-activity post-weld check despite mentioning cooling (common in context). Structure fully complies with instructions.
