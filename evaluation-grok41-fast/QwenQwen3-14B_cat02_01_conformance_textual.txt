**9.4**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Near-Flawless Aspects)**:
  - **Correct Identification of Violating Cases**: Precisely identifies Cases 2, 3, and 5 as violators (100% accurate; Cases 1 and 4 correctly excluded).
  - **Comprehensive Explanations**: Each violation ties directly to textual rules (e.g., "Authorize payment" before "Package items"; "Ship order" never after "Cancel"; "Package items" required before "Ship order"). References normative constraints explicitly and logically.
  - **Handling Ambiguities**: Excellent interpretation of Case 3's "Authorize  Cancel" (correctly flags as deviation since norm mandates direct "Check  Cancel" for insufficient inventory, with no payment; notes logical incompatibility without overreaching). Acknowledges potential ambiguity thoughtfully but resolves per description.
  - **Structure and Clarity**: Tabular summary, per-case breakdowns, and "Key Interpretations" section are precise, scannable, and comprehensive. No unclarities or verbosity in conclusions.
  - **Logical Soundness**: All impacts explained coherently (e.g., illogic of shipping post-cancel). No extraneous claims.

- **Minor Inaccuracies/Flaws (Strict Deductions)**:
  - **Case 5 Phrasing**: States **"'Ship order' occurs before 'Package items'"** – inaccurate, as "Package items" never occurs (not "before"; it's skipped entirely). Correctly identifies/ quotes the rule and impact (skipping), but wording introduces a logical flaw (implies "Package" appears later). Deduct 0.3 (minor but hypercritically imprecise).
  - **Case 3 Table Wording**: **"cancellation should precede payment"** – slightly loose; norm implies *no payment at all* in cancel path (not just ordering). Deduct 0.2 (minor interpretive stretch, though substantively correct).
  - **Case 2 Completeness**: Fully accurate, but could explicitly note "Ship order" follows "Package" (not ideal, as "Authorize" intervenes wrongly) – no deduction, as primary violation nailed.

- **Overall**: Exceptionally strong (flawless in ~95% of content). Deductions only for phrasing nitpicks; no major errors, omissions, or flawed conclusions. Scores 10 only for perfection; this is "nearly flawless."
