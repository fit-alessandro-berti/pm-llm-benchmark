**10.0**

This system prompt is nearly flawless in fulfilling the requirements. It precisely mirrors the schema and normal flow without introducing data-specific hints, enforces self-discovery of anomalies via general categories (standard process mining checks, not revealing sample issues like early payments or skipped credit checks), mandates original hypotheses with plausible general causes, and requires hypothesis-driven SQL queries that are self-contained, valid, and extensible to larger datasets. Output format is rigidly structured for usability. Minor textual artifacts (e.g., "provided here" referencing absent toy data, en-dashes in schema) are cosmetic and do not impact functionality or introduce inaccuracies/unclarities when used as intended (system prompt + data in user message). No logical flaws, over-guidance, or violations of the "no hints" goal. Hypercritical review confirms perfection for purpose.
