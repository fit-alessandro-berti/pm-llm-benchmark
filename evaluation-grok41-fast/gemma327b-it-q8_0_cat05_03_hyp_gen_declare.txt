6.0

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies (Partial Credit, ~6/10):** Identifies core contradiction (existence of 'C' vs. noncoexistence of 'E' and 'C'), weak precedence, unrealistic constraints, and missing dependencies—solid coverage of major issues undermining intended flow. However, critically fails to address the responded_existence constraint ("E" must follow "A"), which creates an unmentioned chain contradiction: 'A'  'E' (required if 'A' occurs), but 'E' forbids 'C', yet 'C' is mandatory. This renders the model impossible for any trace with 'A' (common in intended flow). Ignores init 'R' entirely. Logical flaw: incomplete conflict mapping across *all* constraints.
- **Hypotheses (Strong, ~9/10):** Excellent, creative suggestions aligning with prompt examples (e.g., incremental changes, misinterpretation, data issues). Minor inaccuracy: refers to "constraint against evaluation before closing," but noncoexistence prohibits coexistence *regardless* of order, not sequence-specific.
- **Verification Approaches (Weak, ~4/10):** SQL queries are PostgreSQL-valid in syntax and mostly relevant to prompt examples (closed w/o eval, coexistence, assign-eval link). Queries 1-3 are logically sound for detecting model violations or process deviations. However:
  - Major flaw in Query 4: Operator precedence error (AND > OR). Parsed as `NOT_R OR NOT_A OR NOT_E OR NOT_P OR (NOT_N AND EXISTS_C)`, incorrectly counts *any* claim missing *any* step (even without 'C', e.g., unprocessed claims). Requires parentheses like `EXISTS_C AND (NOT_R OR NOT_A OR ...)`. Unacceptable bug for "strict" verification.
  - Query 2 overcounts (multiple 'E'/'C' per claim inflates COUNT(*)); better `COUNT(DISTINCT claim_id)`.
  - Query 3 tests *E* w/o prior 'A' (precedence), but ignores verifying *responded_existence* ('A' w/o subsequent 'E')—misses chance to probe missed anomaly.
  - No joins to `adjusters` table (e.g., via `resource` matching `adjuster_id`/`specialization`/`region`), despite prompt specifying tables; examples imply checking adjuster correspondence.
- **Overall Structure/Clarity (9/10):** Clean, independent presentation per prompt. No hints leaked. Concise yet comprehensive.
- **Final Score Justification:** Strong hypotheses and partial anomalies offset by critical gaps (missed constraint conflict) and SQL logic error (blocks flawlessness). Hypercritical deduction: not "nearly flawless"—major inaccuracies/logical flaws warrant mid-range score.
