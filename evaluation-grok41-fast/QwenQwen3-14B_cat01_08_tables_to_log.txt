**8.0**

The final event log table is well-structured in Markdown, covers all 5 order_ids completely (including partial process for 1004 with no invented events), derives logical activity names matching the prompt examples, uses order_id as Case ID, includes timestamps ensuring per-case chronological order, enriches with Resource/Actor column using correct name mappings from the Resources table for most events, adds relevant Other Attributes (e.g., customer details, amounts, notes), and handles multiples (deliveries, invoices, payments) as separate events. Assumptions/Notes section appropriately documents gaps (e.g., 1004), summarization decisions implicitly via structure, and key choices like multiples.

However, hypercritical deductions for:
- **Inaccuracies (major flaw)**: Order 1002 DLV-5003 events have wrong Resource/Actor ("FastShip" instead of "GlobalTransport" for CR-01) in 2 rows (second "Order Dispatched" and second "Order Arrived"), despite correct timestamps/attributes/notes. This mismatches Resources table and creates internal inconsistency (resource name vs. carrier_id attribute).
- **Logical unclarities/minor flaws**: Items Picked summarized to 1 event/order using latest timestamp/picker (acceptable per "summarize if appropriate"), but Other Attributes show *only* last item's details (e.g., 1001 ignores ITEM-001; misleading/incomplete for "Items Picked"). No explicit assumption documented for this choice. Payments use payment_method as Resource/Actor (type mismatch vs. person/carrier elsewhere; better as attribute).
- No other events missed, no chronology violations, no ambiguities unaddressed.

Nearly strong (covers 100% data, process mining-ready except noted errors), but inaccuracies prevent >8.0 under strict criteria.
