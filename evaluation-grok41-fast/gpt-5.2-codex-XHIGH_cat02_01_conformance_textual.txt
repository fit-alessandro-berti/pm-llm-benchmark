**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless: it correctly identifies nonconforming cases (2, 3, 5) and conforming ones (1, 4) with precise sequence extractions; violations are accurately mapped to the normative description's rules (e.g., direct quotes for Case 2, explicit "never after cancellation" for Case 3, required sequencing for Case 5); interpretations resolve ambiguities logically without overreach (e.g., "directly after Check" implies no Authorize in cancel path); structure is clear and comprehensive (paths/rules upfront, case-by-case analysis, concise summary); no inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities. Minor cosmetic issue ("casebycase" lacks hyphen) is negligible and does not warrant deduction under hypercritical standards for content quality.
