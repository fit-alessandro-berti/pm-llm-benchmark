**1.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation:
- **Fatal semantic inaccuracy in loop operator (* (RMI, VF))**: The loop definition (* (A, B)) mandates executing A first, then optionally B followed by repeating A. Traces always start and end with A (RMI), with B (VF) only intervening (e.g., RMI; RMI VF RMI; never RMI VF or RMI RMI VF). Observed log: Case 1 (RMI VF), Case 3 (RMI RMI VF), Case 2 (nothing). No trace matches; loop produces zero fitting behaviors.
- **Fatal inaccuracy in parallel (+ (loop, AD))**: Requires concurrent execution of entire loop (minimal: RMI) and AD for completion. Case 2 skips RMI entirely (impossible). No log evidence of concurrency/interleaving (all sequential); AD always post-loop. Introduces overgeneralization, zero fitness.
- **Structural flaws**: Entire model under sequence post-AE forces mandatory parallel (fails Case 2). Loop VF is re-validation, but first VF is pre-AE (model conflates). Case 3 has consecutive RMI (impossible in *; alternates strictly).
- **Non-optional loop**: Explanation claims "optional repetition," but model mandates RMI minimum. Direct contradiction.
- **Misplaced parallel**: Log is strictly sequential (RA  VF  AE  [optional RMI(s)  VF]  AD  SC  AC). Parallel adds unsupported concurrency, harming precision.
- **Incomplete trace coverage**: Zero replay fitness (no log trace executable). Ignores multi-RMI without interleaving VF. No tau/skip for optional block.
- **Representation unclarity**: Indented text ambiguous (not crisp `-> (+ (* (RMI, VF), AD), ...)` notation from prompt). Nesting implies unparenthesized sequence, risking misparse.
- **Explanation flaws**: Claims "multiple iterations of RMI followed by VF" (unsupported; loop doesn't allow). "Once all... AD" ignores parallel allowing AD mid-loop. Ignores Case 3 consecutive RMI.
- **Overall**: Model discovers nothing accurately; balances no criteria (fitness=0, precision poor, simplicity irrelevant). Equivalent to random structure with right labels. No minor issues—all cardinal failures.
