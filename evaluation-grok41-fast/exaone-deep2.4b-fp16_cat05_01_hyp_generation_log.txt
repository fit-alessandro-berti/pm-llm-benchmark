**4.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Anomalies Identification (Partial Credit, Major Deductions):** Correctly spots 3 minor-to-moderate issues (out-of-order Confirm Shipment in 1002, unscheduled in 1004, resource mismatch). Hypotheses are plausible (system errors, data entry, policy exceptions) but generic/shallow (no ties to e.g., order_value, roles via resources table, or training issues). **Severe flaws:** Completely misses glaring anomalies: (1) Case 1004 lacks *any* Credit Check or Validate Stock (high-value order shipped without checks); (2) Case 1004 has Receive Payment *before* Issue Invoice; (3) Case 1003 has Ship Goods *before* Confirm Shipment; (4) Case 1002 has Ship Goods and Confirm Shipment *before* Credit Check. No mention of missing steps, reverse orders (e.g., payment first), or cross-case patterns. Incomplete coverage = ~50% penalty.
  
- **Hypotheses (Weak):** Ties to causes like "system logic error" or "manual bypass" but ignores deeper ones (e.g., high order_value bypassing credit via policy violation; Finance resources handling payments pre-invoice as training issue). No linkage to `orders` (e.g., priority types) or `resources` (e.g., role violations). Vague/uninvestigative.

- **SQL Queries (Heavy Deductions for Bugs/Inaccuracy):** Structure is clean, uses correct tables/schema. But **critical logical flaws**:
  | Query | Issue |
  |-------|-------|
  | 1 | Flags *existence* of Validate Stock, not temporal order (no timestamp comparison). Flags normal cases (e.g., 1001). |
  | 2 | LIKE '%shipment_scheduled%' catches *Y* and *N* (no filter for 'N'); flawed `case_id IN (...)` checks arbitrary later event_ids (always true post-event); unused JOIN; doesn't confirm "later" via timestamp/event_id per case. |
  | 3 | Works for mismatch but overly narrow (filters `shipment_scheduled%` unnecessarily; assumes 1:1 Confirm/Ship pair without timestamp order). Good intent but could JOIN `resources` for role/dept checks. |
  | 4 | Duplicate/redundant of #1; LIKE '%Validate Stock%' imprecise (exact match needed); no order check; subquery always returns if exists. |

  No queries for missed anomalies (e.g., `NOT EXISTS (SELECT ... WHERE activity='Perform Credit Check')`, payment timestamp < invoice timestamp via LAG/WINDOW, or JOIN `orders` for high-value skips). Minimal `orders`/`resources` use. Unclear/ineffective for "investigating hypotheses."

- **Explanations:** Misstate query capabilities (e.g., "#1 identifies precedes" — false; "#2 for =N" — false). Repetitive (#1/#4 overlap).

- **Overall:** ~40% accurate (some spot-on anomalies/queries), but incompleteness + bugs + no timestamp logic + missed majors = low score. Not "nearly flawless" (requires 9+).
