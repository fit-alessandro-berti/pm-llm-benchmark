**9.0**

The query is logically flawless, correctly uses a CTE to compute per-case event counts, applies the precise `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` filter to exclude cases with >6 events, and returns the full event rows (`el.*`) via INNER JOIN for the qualifying cases. It adheres perfectly to the requirements, is efficient, readable, DuckDB-compatible, and handles the grouping/filtering as specified. No issues with column assumptions, syntax, or output correctness.

Minor deductions for explanation inaccuracies/unclarities:
- Final sentence states "only events from cases with 6 events are included," which incorrectly omits "or fewer" (contradicting the bullet point above it and the query's `<= 6` logic). This is a factual slip despite the surrounding context making intent clear.
- Unnecessary `event_count` alias in CTE (harmless but adds clutter without use).

These are small but violate "nearly flawless" under hypercritical standards—explanation should be 100% precise. A subquery/IN alternative would score identically.
