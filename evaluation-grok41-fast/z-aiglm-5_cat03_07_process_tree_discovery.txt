**10.0**

The final process tree model `-> ( 'RA', 'VF', 'AE', X ( tau, -> ( * ( 'RMI', tau ), 'VF' ) ), 'AD', 'SC', 'AC' )` is exactly correct, flawlessly capturing all observed traces with perfect fitness (reproduces Case 1, 2, 3 precisely), high precision (enforces at least one RMI before middle VF, no extraneous behaviors like middle VF without RMI or skipping end sequence), and optimal simplicity (minimal operators: one main sequence, one XOR for optionality, one loop for RMI repetitions followed by single re-VF). Syntax matches prompt notation identically (operators, tau, quoted abbreviated labels as per log convention). No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical flaws.
