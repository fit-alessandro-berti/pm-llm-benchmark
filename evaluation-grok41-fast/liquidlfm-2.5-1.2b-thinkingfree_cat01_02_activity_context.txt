**1.0**

The final revised event log is catastrophically flawed: it presents only a partial, fabricated table for C001 (4 invented rows instead of 6 original events), with entirely wrong timestamps (e.g., 10:20:00 vs. actual 09:20:00/10:30:00), nonexistent resources (e.g., "System Connection," "Legacy System"), altered/wrong additional contexts, and incomplete coverage ignoring C002/C003 entirely. No full revised log is provided, violating task point 3 explicitly. Renames like "Recheck Verification" and "Follow-up Call" vaguely nod to some contexts (e.g., re-verification after submission) but fail to systematically disambiguate all repeats ("Verify Documents" x2 in C001/C003; "Call Customer" x2 in C002) or handle singletons consistently. Justification is superficial, inaccurate (e.g., claims "shift from general inquiry" without case-specific mapping), and ignores key clues like "request missing docs" vs. "confirm adjustments." No identification of all multi-occurrence activities per task point 1. Logically incoherent and unusable.
