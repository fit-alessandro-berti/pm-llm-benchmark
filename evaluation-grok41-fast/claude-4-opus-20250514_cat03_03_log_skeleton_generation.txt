**4.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Structure and Format (Perfect: +2.0)**: Dictionary keys exactly match spec. All constraint values are correctly sets of tuples (Python `{tuple1, tuple2}` syntax valid). `activ_freq` correctly a dict of strset[int]. All 10 activities covered. Code executable. No syntax errors.
- **activ_freq (Excellent: +1.5)**: Accurately models mandatory exactly-once for core flow (ROIC) per linear "must be processed" scenario. RP `{0,1}` smartly handles optional/post-payment. No multiples assumed (reasonable for per-order abstraction). No flaws.
- **directly_follows (Near-perfect: +1.5)**: Captures exact linear sequence ROCARIPIQCPOGSLDIC without RP (correct, as payment not direct/immediate). Aligns with scenario's "series of activities."
- **always_before / always_after (Strong: +1.5)**: Perfect reverse/forward chains enforce strict ordering (e.g., RO < CA < RI < ... < IC, with RP only if/after IC). Redundancy with equivalence/directly_follows is not a flaw (declarative allows it). No missing links; RP optional handled correctly (no always_after from IC).
- **equivalence (Reasonable but unnecessary: +0.5)**: Unidirectional per spec ("if first, same occurrences as second"). Choices valid (#RO=1#D=1, etc., aligns with freq/chains). Not semantically wrong for scenario, but overkill (chains+freq suffice); minor over-specification.
- **never_together (Catastrophic failure: -2.0)**: Complete misunderstanding/inaccuracy. Spec: "cannot co-exist inside the same case" = **cannot both occur in any trace**. Choices ('RI','RP'), ('PI','D'), ('QC','IC') are illogical:
  - All violate freq: PI=1 always, D=1 always  **no trace possible** (forbids all cases).
  - RI=1 always, RP sometimes=1  contradicts RP freq.
  - QC=1, IC=1  forbids all.
  - Scenario has **all co-existing** in traces. Should be `{}` (no mutual exclusions). Explanation confuses with "concurrent/simultaneously" (wrong; spec is co-occurrence).
- **Explanation (Good intent, but flawed: +0.5)**: Captures logic well (sequence, mandatory, flexibility), but never_together excuses illogical; ignores inconsistency.
- **Overall Logical Integrity (Fail: -1.0)**: **Internal contradiction**—model accepts **zero traces** matching scenario (e.g., no trace with PI+D). Misrepresents process fatally. Minor redundancies OK, but this obliterates validity.

**Total: 4.0**. Strong on sequence/freq (80% of keys flawless), but never_together's blunder (inconsistency + misinterpretation) is a "significant" (prompt) logical flaw warranting heavy deduction. Not "nearly flawless"—fundamentally broken model.
