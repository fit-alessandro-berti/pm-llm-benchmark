The provided answer is flawless. The SQL query precisely implements the requirements: it correctly identifies consecutive sequences using LAG/LEAD over the proper window (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp), filters for the exact activity sequence centered on 'Create Order', applies the strict "> INTERVAL 5 DAYS" condition on the LEAD timestamp difference (valid DuckDB syntax), collects distinct bad case_ids, and excludes all events from those cases via NOT IN. DuckDB WINDOW clause usage is syntactically correct and efficient. The query handles all logical cases (multiple sequences, edges, etc.) without flaws. The explanation is concise, accurate, and reinforces the logic without errors. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or issues whatsoever.
