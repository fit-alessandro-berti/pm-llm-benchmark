The provided answer is nearly flawless: both queries are semantically correct, efficient, and precisely solve the problem by identifying `case_id`s with 6 events and returning all events (full rows via `SELECT *`) from only those cases. The QUALIFY approach is idiomatic DuckDB SQL (fully supported), concise, and single-pass performant; the subquery is portable standard SQL. The explanation is accurate, structured, and addresses grouping (`PARTITION BY`/`GROUP BY`), counting (`COUNT(*)`), filtering (`QUALIFY`/`HAVING`+`WHERE IN`), and output without extraneous details like `ORDER BY`. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, syntax errors, edge-case oversights (e.g., handles arbitrary additional columns, NULLs implicitly via count), or deviations from the spec. Providing two options enhances value without diluting focus, as both are explicitly validated.
