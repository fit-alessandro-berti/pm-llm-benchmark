**8.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**:
  - **Task 1 (Identification)**: Accurately lists all durations with approximations matching calculations (~2.25h, ~25.17h, etc.). Correctly flags Case 105 as extreme outlier (double average), Cases 102/104 as above-average (quantified margins ~4-5h). Uses average implicitly (consistent with data) and baselines others effectively. Structure clear with table-like summary.
  - **Task 2 (Root Causes)**: Precisely identifies key gaps with exact timestamps/durations (e.g., 28.5h post-escalation in 105, 19h inv-to-res in 102/104/105, 3.5h assign-to-inv in 104). Links to factors (escalations, L2 bottlenecks, agent capacity, non-escalation). Covers all long cases without omission. Logical, data-driven.
  - **Task 3 (Explanations/Recommendations)**: Clearly explains causal links (e.g., manual handoff  delays). Recommendations specific, actionable, tied to causes (e.g., auto-routing for escalations, time thresholds). Comprehensive (automation, training, metrics). Insights on systemic issues (e.g., L2 capacity).
  - Overall: Near-perfect structure (sections, bullets, conclusion). Concise yet thorough. No unclarities; highly readable.

- **Flaws (Strict Deductions, Preventing 10/9)**:
  - **Inaccuracy in Task 1**: States Case 105 is "**21x longer than Case 103**" – false. Actual: ~49.08h / 1.33h  **36.8x**. Likely a miscalculation or mislabel (21.8x vs Case 101), but it's a factual error in final conclusions. Undermines quantitative precision on "significantly longer."
  - **Minor Omission**: Average (~20.4h) referenced but not explicitly stated/computed in final answer (implied via margins). Prompt requires comparison to average; this is borderline incomplete.
  - No logical flaws, but these inaccuracies (even one minor quant error) warrant significant deduction per instructions ("hypercritical," "minor issues  significantly lower"). Structure/reasoning flawless otherwise, so not lower than 8.0.

Nearly flawless except quant error; 10.0 reserved for zero issues.
