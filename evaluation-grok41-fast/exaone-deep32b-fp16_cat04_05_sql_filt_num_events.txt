**9.2**

### Reasoning for Grade
- **Strengths (leading to high score)**: The final SQL query is **flawless**. It correctly uses a subquery with `GROUP BY case_id` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to identify valid cases, then filters the full event rows via `IN`. This precisely matches the requirement: excludes cases with >6 events, returns *all* events (via `SELECT *`) for cases with 6 events. Syntax is standard and DuckDB-compatible. Structure (Approach, Code, Explanation) is clear, professional, and directly addresses grouping/filtering.
- **Deductions (strict/hypercritical evaluation)**:
  - **Minor inaccuracy in wording (significant penalty per instructions)**: In Explanation #2, "valid cases (those with 6 events)" incorrectly implies *exactly* 6 events, omitting "or fewer" despite the query's `<= 6` and consistent "six or fewer" elsewhere (e.g., Approach, Explanation #1). This introduces a logical imprecision/ambiguity, misstating the criteria for valid cases.
  - **Minor redundancy/unclarity**: Subquery's `SELECT case_id` after `GROUP BY case_id` implicitly yields unique values, but no issue; however, explanation redundantly notes "list of `case_id`s" without harm. No major flaws, but contributes to "nearly" (not fully) flawless.
- **Overall**: Nearly perfect (query/approach/logic 100%), but wording flaw warrants deduction from 10.0 to 9.2. No other inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws (e.g., handles edges like exactly 6 events; no unnecessary complexity). Higher than 9.0 due to isolated nature of issue; lower than 10.0 per "hypercritical" mandate.
