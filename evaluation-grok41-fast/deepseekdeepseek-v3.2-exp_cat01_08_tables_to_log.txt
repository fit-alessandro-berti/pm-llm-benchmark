**9.5**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is **nearly flawless** in core requirements (data integration, completeness, chronology, case identification, activity derivation, timestamp mapping, resource enrichment), earning a very high score. It faithfully extracts **every row** from all relevant tables into distinct events (9 picks, 5 created, 10 delivery events [5 dispatch + 5 arrive], 5 invoices, 5 payments = 34 events total), links correctly via keys (order_id  invoice_id  payment_id chains perfect), maintains **strict chronological order per case** (all timestamps strictly increasing within each order_id), uses `order_id` as Case ID, derives logical activity names matching prompt examples, maps **all resources accurately** from Resources table (sales/pickers/billers/carriers), and enriches with relevant attrs. Markdown table is well-structured, assumptions/notes documented, 1004 correctly partial. Output directly usable for process mining.

**Minor deductions (-0.5 total, preventing 10.0):**
- **Inaccuracy (truncated data, -0.2)**: DLV-5005 note "Fragile items" omits ", handle with care" (full string from table); all other notes full/accurate.
- **Unclarity/inconsistency (-0.2)**: Attr keys vary ("delivery_note:" for 1001 dispatch vs. "note:" for others); arrive events omit notes present in dispatch (could repeat for completeness).
- **Incomplete enrichment (-0.1)**: Payments omit `payment_reference` (available in table, like REF-CC-123; included method but not all relevant data vs. invoices/dispatches).

No logical flaws, missing events, chrono errors, wrong mappings, or violations. No over-summarization (multiples as separate events, meaningful). Cosmetic only—strictly, these are minor issues warranting deduction, but core excellence justifies 9.5.
