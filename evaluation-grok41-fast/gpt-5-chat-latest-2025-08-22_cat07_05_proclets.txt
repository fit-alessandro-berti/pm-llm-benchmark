**10.0**

### Rationale
- **Completeness (perfect)**: Covers all three parts (a, b, c) exhaustively, matching the diagram's visuals, labels, flows, multiplicities, table data, and terminology (e.g., "proclet"/"proçlet" as pi-calculus-inspired processes/channels).
- **Accuracy (perfect)**: Precise descriptions of workflows, steps, channels (Order system, HIS), loops, class relationships (1..1 to 1..*), and performative details (exact table content, e.g., "HGB test for John").
- **Clarity & Structure (perfect)**: Well-organized with headings, numbered steps, bolding, and a concise summary. No errors, jargon handled appropriately.
- **Insight (excellent)**: Adds value via loop explanation and offer for narrative walkthrough without fabricating details.

Flawless response—award-worthy.
