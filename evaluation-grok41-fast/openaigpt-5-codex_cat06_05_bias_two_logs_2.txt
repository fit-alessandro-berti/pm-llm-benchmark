The answer is nearly flawless: precisely identifies Group B as biased, accurately dissects manifestation via selective boosts and concrete cross-group comparisons (e.g., P002 vs. U003, highlighting superior unboosted scores rejected while inferior boosted scores succeed), logically links to disparate treatment risks without unsubstantiated assumptions, and thoroughly covers implications with sharp focus on merit, inclusion, and legal exposure. Structure is exemplary (bolded sections, bullets, evidence citations). Added recommendations are relevant enhancements, not extraneous. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or even minor typos/omissions—hypercritical review confirms perfection in addressing the query.
