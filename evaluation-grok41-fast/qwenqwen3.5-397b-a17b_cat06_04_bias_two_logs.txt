**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical evaluation. It precisely identifies the Group B log as exhibiting the bias (via the explicit `ScoreAdjustment` mechanism absent in Group A), correctly explains manifestation through the `+10 Community Boost` tied to `CommunityGroup` (unavailable to Group A due to `LocalResident: FALSE`), and rigorously demonstrates systematic differences via the decisive P002 (710, Rejected) vs. U003 (705 adjusted, Approved) comparison—proving a lower effective threshold for qualifying Group B cases. All attributes are accurately linked, thresholds inferred correctly (~720 for A, ~705 boosted for B), disparate impact quantified without error, and conclusions logically tie to unfair final decisions favoring the Unprotected Group. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws; comprehensive and evidence-based.
