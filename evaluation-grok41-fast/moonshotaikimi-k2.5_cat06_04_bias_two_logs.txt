**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless: it precisely identifies **Group B's log** as exhibiting the bias (via explicit mechanisms absent in Group A's log), rigorously explains manifestation through the **ScoreAdjustment** (+10 Community Boost), ties it directly to **LocalResident=TRUE** (enabling eligibility) and **CommunityGroup** membership (triggering the boost), and demonstrates **systematic differences** in decisions via concrete evidence (e.g., U003's 695705 approved vs. P002's 710 rejected, despite lower scores), a comparison table, and threshold inconsistencies. Logical flow is airtight, with no inaccuracies, ambiguities, or omissions; it even notes intra-Group B variation (U002) and proxy risks. Hypercritical review finds zero flaws warranting deduction.
