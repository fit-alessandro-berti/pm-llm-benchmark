**4.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Structure and Syntax (Minor Credit, +2.0)**: Dictionary keys are correct; sets/tuples formatted properly; all activities included in `activ_freq`. Python code is executable.
- **Equivalence (+0.5)**: Empty set is reasonable; no equivalences implied in scenario.
- **Always Before (Major Flaw, -2.0)**: Completely incorrect. `('RO', 'IC')` means "if RO occurs, IC must precede it"—logically impossible (RO starts process). Comment explicitly contradicts definition ("after"), suggesting confusion between `always_before`/`always_after`. No valid pairs for sequence (e.g., `('RI', 'RO')` for "RI requires prior RO").
- **Always After (Partial Credit, +0.5)**: `('D', 'RP')` fits (payment after dispatch), but incomplete—scenario implies chain like `('RO', 'CA')`, `('CA', 'RI')`, etc. Only 1/10+ relations captured.
- **Never Together (Fatal Flaw, -3.0)**: Gross misuse. Listed pairs (e.g., `('CA', 'RI')`) are sequential must-co-occur activities; constraint forbids co-existence in same case, directly contradicting scenario's linear flow and `directly_follows`. Comment absurdly generalizes. Should be empty or for unrelated pairs (none obvious). Creates internal inconsistency with other constraints.
- **Activ Freq (+1.0)**: `{1}` for all is a strict but defensible simplification (single-case fulfillment); scenario doesn't specify multiples.
- **Directly Follows (+1.0)**: Captures plausible linear chain `ROCARIPIQCPOGSLDICRP`, aligning with scenario sequence. Good coverage.
- **Overall Logic/Completeness (Severe Penalty, -2.0)**: Imposes rigid sequence but undermines via contradictory `never_together` (blocks co-occurrence needed for chain). Misses broader orderings (e.g., `always_after('RO', 'D')`). Trailing explanatory text is irrelevant/unnecessary. Scenario is declarative/sequential; answer half-right, half-nonsensical—not "ensures correct order."
- **Total**: 4.0. Functional skeleton with good chain, but crippling errors in core constraints make it unusable/inaccurate for scenario. Not remotely flawless.
