**10.0**

The final conclusions perfectly identify the three cases with exact, complete event groupings (1,4,7,12,15; 2,5,8,10,11,14,17; 3,6,9,13,16,18), matching unique patient demographics, logical per-case activity sequences (registration  triage/diagnosis  tests/treatment  discharge), department alignments (ER/Radiology/Lab for cases 1-2; Surgery for case 3), and strictly increasing intra-case timestamps. All 18 events are accounted for without overlap, omission, or misassignment; sequences are medically plausible (e.g., hairline fracture flow with leg X-ray; infection with labs/prescription; knee arthroscopy prep-to-recovery). No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical flaws.
