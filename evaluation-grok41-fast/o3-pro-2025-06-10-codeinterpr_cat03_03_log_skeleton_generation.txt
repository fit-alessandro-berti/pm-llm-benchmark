**7.2**

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**:
  - Perfect syntactic compliance: Dictionary structure, keys, sets of tuples, activ_freq as dict of sets — directly copy-pasteable.
  - Covers all 10 activities in activ_freq with plausible frequencies (mandatory linear path except optional RP aligns with scenario's "must be processed" + conditional payment).
  - Most constraints logically sound for a linear success-path model: always_before/always_after chains correctly reverse each other for the core sequence (RICARI, etc.); directly_follows enforces immediate succession well for mandatory steps.
  - never_together empty is accurate (no exclusions in scenario).
  - Good comments explaining rationale, tied to scenario logic (e.g., "reserving items requires... availability checked first").
  - Enforces start with RO via directly_follows ('RO','CA') + freq=1, preventing invalid orders indirectly.

- **Major Deductions (strictly penalizing inaccuracies/logical flaws)**:
  - **Critical internal inconsistency on RP (deduct ~2.0)**: activ_freq {'RP': {0,1}} and comment explicitly state "optional (0 or 1 time per case)", but always_after ('IC','RP') *forces* RP 1 whenever IC occurs (IC always {1}), and directly_follows ('IC','RP') forces it *immediately after*. This makes RP mandatory, contradicting freq/comment/scenario ("*once* the customer pays" implies optional). Model permits no valid traces with 0 RP — fatal logical flaw in a declarative model where *all* constraints must hold simultaneously.
  - **Incomplete ordering chain (deduct ~0.5)**: No always_before ('CA','RO') or always_after ('RO','CA'), so looser ordering constraints skip RO. Direct-follows covers it coincidentally (due to freq=1), but skeleton is inconsistent/redundant — always_* chains start midway arbitrarily.
  - **Questionable equivalence (deduct ~0.3)**: Only *one directed* pair ('RO','IC'); definition is asymmetric ("if first... same as second"), but full mutual equivalence needs ('IC','RO') too. Why *these* two specifically? All mandatory activities have identical counts ({1}), so arbitrary/selective — unclear logic despite comment.

- **Minor Deductions (per "even minor issues significantly lower")**:
  - Hedging language ("one plausible... illustrative – real logs might reveal additional or different") undermines direct representation of *scenario* (not real logs); task demands definitive model for described process.
  - No never_together or additional constraints (e.g., no equivalence for other {1}-freq pairs; no bounds like QC 1 implicitly via chain).
  - always_before/after perfectly symmetric except endpoints — minor asymmetry unaddressed.

Nearly flawless would exclude RP contradiction + complete chains (9.5–10.0). This is strong but undermined by self-contradiction + gaps = 7.2 (good effort, major fixable errors).
