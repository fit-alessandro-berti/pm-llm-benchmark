The provided solution is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It precisely identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence using `LEAD` window functions partitioned and ordered correctly by `case_id` and `timestamp`, ensuring direct succession with no intervening events. The time filter `(third_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'` accurately targets the interval between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in matching triplets. Exclusion via `NOT IN` correctly removes *all events* from qualifying cases, as required. DuckDB syntax is correct (e.g., `INTERVAL`), handles edge cases (e.g., `NULL` from `LEAD` if insufficient rows), uses `DISTINCT` appropriately, and includes sensible `ORDER BY` for readability.

Minor pedantic note (not deducting due to perfection otherwise): The table has "*at least*" the listed columns, so `SELECT *` would be maximally robust for "all events," but selecting the described columns matches the prompt's focus exactly, and the explanation claims "all columns from the original" without contradiction in context. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, inefficiencies, or unclarities.
