**4.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Answer Only)
- **Major Structural Flaws (Severe Penalty)**:
  - FAS  DDI is explicitly described as a *sequence* ("final sequence of administrative and informational steps"), but modeled as `+(FAS, DDI)` (parallel). This fundamentally violates the process logic, as order matters (FAS before DDI).
  - Loop `*` modeling is invalid and incorrect: First child is singleton `"Specialist Consultation"`; second child uses undefined operators `|` (not X), `=>` (not -> or any valid), and malformed nesting like `"+Targeted Medication" | "+Specialized Physical Therapy" => X(...)`. Does not match `* (A, B)` semantics where A = `->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))` (initial body sequence) and B = `tau` (exit/redo). Fails to repeat the full body (SC  treatment  RDT) as required.
  - No explicit `tau` leaf for loop exit, despite description requiring loop termination on normal results.

- **Syntax and Notation Violations (Severe Penalty)**:
  - Invalid prefixes like `"+Comprehensive ECG"` (labels must be `'CE'`, not prefixed or full names; example uses `'A'`, `'B'`).
  - Uses full descriptive names (e.g., `"Arrival"`) instead of exact expected abbreviations (`'A'`, `'RG'`, etc.). Adds extraneous `+` before every label (e.g., `"+Specialist Consultation"`), corrupting leaves.
  - Non-standard elements: Comments `//`, pipes `|`, arrows `=>` inside notation (undefined; prompt uses strict `(A, B)` parentheses).
  - Inconsistent quoting/bracketing (e.g., `+("Follow-up Appointment Scheduling", ...)` mixes styles).

- **Minor but Cumulative Issues (Further Penalty)**:
  - Initial sequence nesting correct (`A  RG  IA  TI  TC`), but X(CE, FBP) uses wrong labels/prefixes.
  - Concurrencies correct for AI+NC and BL+ICP+MRF (operators and positions), but labels wrong.
  - Explanations claim accuracy (e.g., "Loop body starts with specialist consultation... Redo Path: Treatment & retests") but contradict shown structure; table mislabels SEQUENCE example.
  - No `RDT` explicit (ok if X(FCE,FBA) proxies), but overall tree doesn't produce valid traces matching description (e.g., loop won't repeat SC properly).

- **Partial Credits**: Recognizes overall sequential spine with branches; positions most operators roughly correctly (e.g., X after TC, + after loop). But not "nearly flawless"—core errors make it unusable/inaccurate.

Score reflects ~40% fidelity to spec: basic skeleton present, but broken execution/logic prevents high mark. Flawless would match think-part insight exactly in final notation.
