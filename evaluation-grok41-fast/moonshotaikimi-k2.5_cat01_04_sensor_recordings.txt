**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**:
  - Excellent pattern identification and grouping: Accurately clusters events into logical phases based on sensor changes (e.g., 4-6 for cutting via flow/vibration/tool motion; 9 for welding via heat/vibration spike). Table is clear, comprehensive, and includes key signatures for *all* groups.
  - Intuitive labels mostly align with prompt examples ("Cutting Metal", "Welding", "Quality Inspection"); inventions like "Part Positioning/Clamping" and "Cooling/Transition" are reasonable and supported.
  - Strong deductions with sensor-specific evidence (e.g., friction heat + flow for cutting; localized heat + no flow for welding). Process flow visualization adds value, showing a coherent cycle.
  - Covers all 15 events without gaps or overlaps.

- **Flaws (Strict Deductions, -1.8 total)**:
  - **Incomplete rationales (-0.8)**: Prompt requires "a rationale for why you assigned *each* label" and "explanation of how you deduced *each one*". "Rationale and Deduction" section explicitly details only 4/7 labels (skips Idle/Startup, Cooling/Transition, Process Complete/Idle). Table signatures imply them, but this violates explicit instructions—major logical gap despite obviousness for baselines.
  - **Minor inaccuracies/interpretations (-0.4)**: Event 7-8 temp *drops* (5840°C) better fits "cooling post-cut" than "clamping" (pressure only mildly up to 2 bar; flow still present). "Quality Inspection" for 11-12 is speculative (low flow/vibration could equally be "Packaging"); no evidence distinguishes over alternatives. Single-event phases (9,10) feel forced vs. merging into transitions.
  - **Unclarities/typos (-0.3)**: Rationale typo "tool advancing (5mm 10mm)" (missing dash/space). Dual Idle labels ("Startup" vs. "Complete") redundant; could unify as one activity type. No quantification (e.g., thresholds for "high" vibration).
  - **Minor omissions (-0.3)**: No explicit transition discussion (e.g., why tool jumps 1520mm post-cooling). Ignores potential repeats (13-15 mirrors 1-3 exactly). No "Packaging" despite prompt example, though data doesn't strongly fit.

Nearly flawless structure/logic elevates from low 7s, but strict adherence to "each label" rationale and zero tolerances for speculation/typos prevent 9+.
