The provided SQL query is logically flawless, syntactically correct for DuckDB, and precisely matches the requirements: it accurately identifies `case_id`s with 6 events via the subquery (using standard `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`), then returns the full set of events (`SELECT *`) for exactly those cases via `IN`. It handles all specified criteria, including exactly 6 events, edge cases like minimum 1 event per case (implicitly), and preserves all columns.

Minor deductions (total -0.5) for explanation inaccuracies under hypercritical scrutiny:
- Phrasing "valid cases (6 events)" omits "or fewer," creating slight ambiguity despite prior context (could mislead on 6 vs. =6).
- Claim of "in a single pass over the original table" is incorrect; the structure requires two logical table scans (subquery aggregation + outer filter), regardless of potential optimizer behavior.

No other inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws; the answer is nearly perfect.
