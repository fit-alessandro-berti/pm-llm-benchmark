**3.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Summary:
- **Major semantic inaccuracy (fitness failure)**: The proposed `* ('RMI', 'VF')` loop generates traces like `RMI`, `RMI VF RMI`, `RMI VF RMI VF RMI`, etc. (always starts/ends with `RMI`, cannot end with `VF`, no consecutive `RMI`). This fails to replay:
  | Case | Post-AE trace | Replays? |
  |------|---------------|----------|
  | 1    | `RMI VF`     |  (no exit after `VF`) |
  | 2    | (empty)      |  (loop mandatory, min. `RMI`) |
  | 3    | `RMI RMI VF` |  (no consecutive `RMI`) |
  Fitness 0%; claims "balance" but ignores this.
- **Logical flaw in optionality**: Loop positioned in mandatory sequence; no `XOR(tau, ...)` or equivalent to skip (Case 2). Explanation says "you could" (implying optional) but model enforces it.
- **Misstated loop semantics**: Explanation claims "RMI and re-validate... multiple times before concluding... to AD", but semantics force re-entry to `RMI` after `VF`, preventing direct exit to `AD`.
- **Uncaptured behavior**: Consecutive `RMI` (Case 3) unmodeled; re-`VF` only post-`RMI(s)`, not interleaved.
- **Structural/notation issues**: Multi-child `->` acceptable per prompt, but overall tree doesn't balance precision/simplicity (overfits wrong loop, underfits skips/repeats).
- **Excess content**: Task demands "**just the final structure**"; answer adds steps, explanation, table-irrelevant intro (violates "no code/needs executed").
- **Minor unclarities**: Quotes `'RMI', VF` inconsistently; assumes loop captures "repetitions" without evidence.

Partial credit for correct main sequence (`RA  VF  AE  ...  AC`), loop *position*, and textual notation mimicking prompt. But core model flawed  low score. A flawless answer needs `XOR(tau, (*('RMI', tau), 'VF'))` or equivalent (with `tau` leaf) for zero+ `RMI` then optional `VF`, replaying all traces simply/precisely.
