**5.0**

### Reasoning:
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Perfect Python syntax and structure (valid dict with tuple keys/values). Includes **all 45 possible transitive pairs** (full set, exceeding "representative subset" while ensuring complexity with long-range pairs like `('SS', 'AS')`). Directionally realistic estimates for supply chain (short for near-consecutive like `('PT', 'PK')` ~1h; long for distant like `('SS', 'AS')` ~1yr). Comments and notes add clarity/value. Units in seconds, stdevs plausible (often ~20-40% of avg).
- **Critical flaws (major deductions)**:
  - **Logical inconsistency in averages**: Temporal distances must satisfy additivity: `avg(AC)  avg(AB) + avg(BC)` for sequential B (fundamental to definition, as time(AC) = time(AB) + time(BC) in every trace). Examples:
    | Violating triple | Listed avgs (sec) | Sum of segments | Direct avg | Discrepancy |
    |------------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|
    | OPRCPT | OPRC: 432k (~5d), RCPT: 605k (~7d) | 1,037k (~12d) | OPPT: 691k (~8d) | Direct < sum (impossible) |
    | QICAPT | QICA: 18k (~5h), CAPT: 86k (1d) | 104k (~1.2d) | QIPT: 576k (~6.7d) | Direct >> sum (impossible) |
    | SSDTAS | SSDT: 907k (~10.5d), DTAS: 2,592k (30d) | 3,499k (~40.5d) | SSAS: 31,536k (~365d) | Direct ~9x > sum (gross error) |
    Many more (e.g., CAPK: 173k vs CAPT+PTPK=90k; systematic for *-AS pairs).
  - This invalidates the model as a coherent "temporal profile" — cannot represent real trace statistics.
  - Minor numerical sloppiness: Arbitrary/non-round values (e.g., `620000`, `641600` — not clean multiples of 3600/86400); some stdevs disproportionately high/low without justification.
- **Overall**: Structure/scope excellent (~8/10), but core logical inaccuracies (non-additivity) are fatal for a "model describing ... times between ... activities" — not "nearly flawless." Strict deduction for hypercritical standards.
