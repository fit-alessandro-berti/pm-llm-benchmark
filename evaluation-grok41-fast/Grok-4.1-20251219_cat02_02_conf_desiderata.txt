**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
The answer is strong in structure, clarity, and coverage of *most* elements, perfectly mirroring the task's 1-2-3 format with precise language, accurate timings (e.g., ~49/51 hours for Case 3), and thoughtful interpretations (e.g., weekends for delays). Case 1 and 3 analyses are flawless for normative compliance, and desiderata handling correctly emphasizes "suboptimal but not severe." Interpretations are creative yet grounded.

However, under utmost strictness, **major deductions** for critical inaccuracies and incompletenesses (each warranting significant point loss per instructions):

1. **Major Inaccuracy: Missed Key Normative Violation in Case 2 (Primary Flaw, -2.0 points)**  
   The log for Case 2 *completely skips "Inform Applicant"*, a **mandatory step** per core rules: "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision"; "no skipping activities." Case 2 goes Decision (Rejected, 09:30)  Finalize  Close *without Inform*, violating sequence, skipping, and decision logic. The answer ignores this entirely—no mention in violations list, desiderata, or interpretations. It only covers the two log-highlighted issues (order reversal, wrongful Finalize). Explanation of reasons is **incomplete**, failing "identify... and explain the reasons" fully. This is not minor; it's a core constraint oversight in the "only violating case."

2. **Minor Inaccuracy: Wording in Case 2 Normative (-0.5 points)**  
   Describes as "skipped the mandatory order," but Credit Check *was performed* (just after Risk Assessment). Accurate term is *reversed/out-of-order*, not "skipped" (which implies omission, per "What is Not Allowed"). Logical flaw in precision.

3. **Minor Unclarity/Assumptive Logic in Desiderata Case 1 (-0.5 points)**  
   Assumes Follow-up Call "either occurred (off-log) or... satisfied" because "none of the cases show one" and no "noted issues." But desiderata explicitly encourages it "sometime before closing"; log shows none anywhere, yet *only Case 3 notes absence explicitly*. This hedges inconsistently ("assume"), introducing speculation where strict analysis should note potential desiderata gap (like Case 2/3) or clarify log limits. Suboptimal clarity.

No other flaws (e.g., timings flawless, no logical errors elsewhere, justifications plausible without violating rules). Starts at 10.0  deduct to 7.0 for one major + two minors. Not "nearly flawless" due to incomplete violation analysis.
