**9.8/10.0**

### Reasoning for Grade:
- **Accuracy (10/10)**: Perfectly identifies all nodes (a-z), labels, connections, loop (via f), splits/joins, and legend details. Flow logic matches the diagram precisely.
- **Completeness (10/10)**: Covers every element—activities, flows, legend table, routing semantics (XOR/AND/OR with dots)—no omissions.
- **Clarity & Structure (9.5/10)**: Excellent use of tables, numbered steps, and concise language. Minor deduction for vague "parallel/alternative paths" from **a** (diagram suggests XOR-split based on symbol position; could specify types per arc for perfection). Includes helpful textual viz.
- **Conciseness (10/10)**: Focused, no fluff; directly useful for understanding.

Near-perfect response—exceptional for visualization analysis.
