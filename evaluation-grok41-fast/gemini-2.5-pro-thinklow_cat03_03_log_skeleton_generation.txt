**2.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Assessment)
- **Major logical flaws (deduct 4+ points each)**:
  - **Always_before completely inverted**: Every pair (e.g., `('RO', 'CA')`) violates the explicit definition ("if first occurs, second previously"). Logically, this requires successors *before* predecessors (e.g., CA before RO), contradicting the scenario's linear flow. Even their own comments contradict the pairs (e.g., `('RO', 'D')` commented as "RO before D" but enforces D before RO). This renders ~25% of the skeleton unusable/inverted.
  - **Always_after polluted with redundancy**: Correct direction (forward), but duplicates `always_before`'s invalid pairs and mixes direct/transitive without necessity (e.g., `('RO', 'D')` is implied by chain). Bloats constraints unnecessarily.
  - **Equivalence incomplete/inaccurate**: Pairs only link to RO, assuming transitivity (undefined). Does *not* directly enforce e.g., PI  QC or IC  RP. Definition requires "same occurrences if first occurs"; partial graph fails full enforcement despite `{1}` freq. Rationale wrongly claims "all equivalent" without full pairs or symmetry (no reverse tuples like `('CA', 'RO')`).
  
- **Minor inaccuracies/unclarities (deduct 0.5-1 point each)**:
  - **Activ_freq overly rigid**: `{1}` assumes *every* activity mandatory/exactly once (e.g., RP "once customer pays"—implies possible 0 if unpaid; QC/RI skippable in edge cases). Scenario implies "must" for core flow but not explicitly financials. No {0,1} bounds for realism.
  - **Directly_follows minor gap**: Chain logical but omits potential ('IC', something) or branches; rationale notes ('IC','RP') gap correctly but assumes no post-IC direct.
  - **Never_together trivial**: Empty set correct, but rationale's "all co-exist" ignores possible exclusions (e.g., no cancellation activity).
  - **Rationale self-contradictory**: Comments describe correct logic (e.g., "preceding must have occurred") but implement opposite. "Brief breakdown" misstates equivalence necessity.
  - **Code/style issues**: Sets valid Python but inline comments clutter; extraneous print code outside dict; no validation (e.g., `assert` structure); not "pure" dict as requested.

- **Strengths (minimal credit)**: Correct overall structure/keys; `directly_follows` and `never_together` flawless; `activ_freq` plausible; Python syntax works.

Nearly half the constraints are broken/inverted, failing basic trace validation (e.g., valid ROCA trace violates their `always_before`). Not "nearly flawless"—fundamentally unreliable. 2.0 for structure + partial correctness.
