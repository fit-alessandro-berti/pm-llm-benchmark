The provided answer is precise, comprehensive, and directly aligned with the task requirements. It accurately identifies normative violations exclusively in Case 2 (order reversal, missing mandatory "Inform Applicant", and forbidden "Finalize Documentation" post-rejection), correctly absolves Cases 1 and 3 of normative issues, and distinguishes desiderata failures without conflating them (e.g., Case 1: only missing Follow-up Call; Case 3: all three timings/call; Case 2: call, subordinated to normatives). Justifications are plausibly interpretive (e.g., weekends for Case 3 delays, procedural errors for Case 2 without excusing violations), "in line" with constraints, and applied to all cases where possible. No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or logical flaws; structure enhances readability with bullets and bolding.
