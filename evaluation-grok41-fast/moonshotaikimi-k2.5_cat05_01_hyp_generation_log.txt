**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (Supporting Higher Base Score):**
- **Anomaly Identification (9.5/10)**: Precisely detects all key deviations in cases 1002–1004 (e.g., early shipping in 1002, missing validation/post-hoc confirm in 1003, prepayment/missing controls in 1004). Correctly ignores normal case 1001. Captures metadata clues (e.g., `attempted_early=Y`, `late_confirmation=Y`, `shipment_scheduled=N`) accurately. Risks articulated clearly.
- **Hypotheses (9.0/10)**: Insightful, data-grounded (e.g., links to `priority` type, specific resources like WarehouseClerk_3/LogisticsMgr_2, customer prepay). Covers system errors, policy violations, training gaps without overreach. Ties to tables (e.g., `orders.order_type`, `resources`).
- **Structure & Clarity (9.5/10)**: Executive summary, detailed breakdown, categorized queries with purposes, recommendations. Concise yet comprehensive; no verbosity in final output.
- **SQL Relevance (8.0/10)**: Queries target hypotheses directly (sequence violations, missing activities, resources, metadata, temporal). Uses PostgreSQL idioms well (window funcs, STRING_AGG, BOOL_OR, LIKE, EXISTS). Joins `orders`/`resources` appropriately. Covers broad investigation without hints.

**Flaws (Strict Deductions - Cumulative -2.8):**
- **SQL Syntax/Executability Errors (-1.5)**: 
  - Query Set 3: Critical alias error in Receive Payment subquery (`case_id = order_event_log.case_id` – undefined alias `order_event_log` in subquery scope). `AVG(ae.order_value)` fails ( `ae.*` from `oel.*`, no `order_value` selected). Anomalous_cases logic circular/incomplete for some conditions.
  - Query Set 5: Incomplete placeholders (`/* subquery for early shipments */`, `/* subquery for prepayments */`) render it non-runnable. `order_event_log` alias misused in CASE WHEN.
  - Query Set 2: Correlated subquery inside `BOOL_AGG` inefficient/risky (evaluates per row pre-aggregation; may return wrong boolean for multi-payment cases). `BOOL_AGG(...)` in HAVING OR clause aggregates oddly for filtering intent.
- **Logical/Precision Gaps (-0.8)**: 
  - Query Set 1: `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (po.credit_check_time - po.timestamp))` errors if `credit_check_time` NULL (common for missing checks); lacks NULL handling (e.g., COALESCE).
  - Query Set 2: `prepayment_indicator` logic assumes single invoice/payment; fragile for multiples. HAVING ORs unrelated flags without prioritization.
  - Misses edge case: No query fully detects *all* missing activities (e.g., no Confirm Shipment before Ship in general). Resource query (Set 3) doesn't aggregate across *all* anomalies uniformly.
  - Hypotheses: Speculates "drop-shipping" (B) without evidence/query to test (minor overreach).
- **Completeness Minor Omissions (-0.3)**: No query for `additional_info` patterns across *all* cases (e.g., credit_score correlation with skips). Temporal query (Set 5) limited to hours but ignores dates despite clustered dates (2024-02-01/02). No customer-level aggregation despite Case 1004 hypothesis.
- **No Policy/Adult Content Issues**: Irrelevant here.

**Net**: Excellent conceptual work elevates to 7+, but SQL bugs (core deliverable) are not "nearly flawless" – multiple non-executable/risky elements demand deduction under strict criteria. Equivalent to a strong B/A- paper with code errors.
