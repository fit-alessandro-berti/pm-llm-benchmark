**6.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting >5.0):**
  - Excellent structure mirroring the task (clear sections 1-3, bullet points, precise timestamps, accurate calculations for Case 3 timings ~49h/51h).
  - Correctly identifies *most* normative violations in Case 2 (Risk before Credit; Finalize after Reject) with solid explanations.
  - Fully accurate on Case 1/3 normative compliance (sequences verified correctly).
  - Desiderata section properly identifies all 3 failures in Case 3, clarifies "suboptimal but permissible," and notes Case 1 compliance.
  - Task 3 (interpretations/justifications) is nearly flawless: insightful (e.g., weekend calendar check for Case 3, system/training errors for Case 2), practical, and aligned with constraints. Distinguishes severity well in conclusion.
  - No unclarities; language precise, professional.

- **Fatal Flaws Penalizing to 6.0 (not nearly flawless; significant inaccuracies/logical gaps):**
  - **Major normative omission (Task 1):** Case 2 *skips "Inform Applicant" entirely* (mandatory post-Decision step per strict rules: "the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; sequence requires it before branch/Close). Log shows Decision (09:30)  Finalize (10:00)  Close (10:30)—clear skip of required step. Answer ignores this, listing only 2 violations instead of 3. This is a core sequence violation ("no skipping"), undermining completeness.
  - **Factual invention/inaccuracy (Tasks 1-2):** Answer repeatedly fabricates "Inform Applicant at ~10:00" for Case 2 (e.g., "Inform within 30 minutes" in desiderata), contradicting the log (no such event exists). This propagates error from <think> to final output, creating false compliance claim and logical inconsistency (can't time a nonexistent step).
  - **Minor logical underemphasis:** Case 2's Credit Check *after* Risk but *before* Decision doesn't mitigate the ordering violation (strict rule is "before any risk evaluation"); answer notes it correctly but could clarify no retroactive fix.
  - These are not "minor"—they're inaccuracies in *identifying violations* (primary task), warranting heavy deduction despite polish. No self-correction; flaws persist in conclusions. A 9-10 requires zero such issues.
