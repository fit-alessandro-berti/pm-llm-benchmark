**8.0**

The answer is well-structured, with clear analyses, a useful comparison table, and a justified conclusion correctly identifying Model 1 as closer to the normative process due to enforced mandatory steps (onboarding/payroll) versus Model 2's critical optional payroll and sequencing flaws. Anomalies in Model 1 (skippable interviews via direct ScreenDecide and partial order ambiguity) and Model 2 (interviews without screening via PostInterview, optional payroll via XOR) are accurately highlighted overall, aligning with standard sequential logic (PostScreenInterviewDecideOnboardPayrollClose).

However, deducting 2 points for factual inaccuracy and logical flaws: (1) Misrepresents LOOP semantics in Model 2—`*(Onboard, skip)` mandates at least one Onboard execution (per prompt definition: execute A first, then optional B+A loops), so onboarding cannot be skipped, yet the answer repeatedly claims it "allows skipping onboarding via Skip" (e.g., analysis, table, severity, conclusion), inventing a non-existent anomaly while missing the real one (unnecessary repeatable onboardings). (2) Misleading structure diagram for Model 2 (LOOP shown as `*(Onboard | Skip)`, implying choice/skip rather than mandatory initial execution). These undermine anomaly precision and justification rigor, though the conclusion holds due to correctly emphasized payroll skip and sequencing issues. Minor issues (baseless footnotes [^3][^5] etc., Screen fully skippable in Model 2 underemphasized) prevent higher score.
