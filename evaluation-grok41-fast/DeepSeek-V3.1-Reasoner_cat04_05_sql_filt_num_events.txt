**10.0**

The provided solution is correct, complete, and precise. The SQL query accurately implements the requirements: it uses a correlated subquery with `GROUP BY case_id` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to identify eligible cases, then filters the full `event_log` to return all columns (`*`) for events in those cases only. This excludes cases with >6 events entirely while preserving all events from qualifying cases (6 events). 

- **Correctness**: Logically flawless; handles grouping and filtering as specified. Works in DuckDB (standard SQL semantics apply). Assumes standard non-NULL `case_id` per problem context, with no need for NULL handling.
- **Completeness**: Returns full events (all columns) for filtered cases.
- **Clarity**: Well-structured code block, concise approach outline, and step-by-step explanation with no ambiguities or errors.
- **Efficiency**: Appropriate for the task; DuckDB optimizes such subqueries effectively.
