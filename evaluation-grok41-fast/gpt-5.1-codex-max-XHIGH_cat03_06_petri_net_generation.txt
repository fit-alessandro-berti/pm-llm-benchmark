**7.0**

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting ~7)**:
  - Code is syntactically flawless: Correct imports, proper use of `PetriNet`, `Marking`, `petri_utils.add_arc_from_to`, bulk `update()` for places/transitions. All arcs properly connected. `im` and `fm` correctly defined with single tokens in logical start/end places.
  - Covers all required activities as labeled transitions: C, CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL with exact/near-exact labels matching scenario.
  - Basic sequence correct: start  C  CR  DV  (branch)  FC  (branch)  CA  AP  P  N  CL  end.
  - Loops modeled: RDS loops back before DV (via p_after_cr  DV); II loops back before FC. Multiple iterations possible via cycles.
  - Accepting net structure valid: From `im` can reach `fm` via intended paths labeling valid traces.
  - Clear explanation tying to scenario.

- **Major Logical Flaws (heavy deductions: -2 total)**:
  - **Shared choice place `p_ready_for_fc` creates invalid traces (-1.5)**: This place (post-DV) has branches to both `t_fc` (correct for DV-ok) and `t_rds` (for DV-fail). However, II loops back *to this same place*. Thus, after II (fraud investigation phase), the token can nondeterministically fire `t_rds` (re-document submission), enabling semantically invalid traces like "...FC  II  RDS  DV  ...". This mixes document loop with fraud loop, violating "logical sequence" and scenario isolation (RDS after DV only; II after FC only, no doc re-submission post-II). Proper model requires *separate* places (e.g., `p_post_dv`  FC/RDS; distinct `p_post_ii`  only FC).
  - **Unbounded nondeterminism allows spurious loops**: Token at `p_ready_for_fc` post-II could re-trigger full DVRDS cycle indefinitely, misrepresenting process semantics.

- **Minor Inaccuracies/Unclarities (deductions: -1 total)**:
  - **AP unconditional despite "if" condition (-0.5)**: Scenario explicitly conditional ("if the amount surpasses a certain threshold"), implying post-CA choice (AP  P *or* skip  P, e.g., via choice place + optional/silent skip trans). Linear CA  AP  P forces AP always, omitting branch. Not "logical" for described process.
  - **Naming slightly unclear (-0.3)**: `p_ready_for_fc` is actually post-DV choice point (not purely "ready for FC"); `p_after_c`/`p_after_cr` etc. proliferate unnecessarily without semantic gain (could consolidate, but minor). Explanation glosses shared place issue.
  - **C transition arguably extraneous (-0.2)**: Scenario frames C as input ("customer files... after which steps take place"), suggesting initial token *post-C* or implicit; explicit `t_c` adds unneeded step before CR.

- **Why not higher?** Not "nearly flawless"—logical flaws allow invalid process traces, failing strict "logical sequence with possible loops" (loops cross-pollute). Not lower (e.g., 5): Core structure/scenario coverage strong; code/executable perfect; accepts *valid* traces correctly.
- **To reach 9-10**: Separate places for loop returns, conditional AP branch (e.g., post-CA choice place  `t_ap` or silent `t_skip`  P), precise naming, no extras.
