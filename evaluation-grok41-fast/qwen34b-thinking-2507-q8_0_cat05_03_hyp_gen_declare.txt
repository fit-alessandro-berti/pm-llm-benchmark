**9.7**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies (Strength: Excellent, 10/10)**: Precisely identifies the core contradiction in `noncoexistence` (E and C cannot both occur, clashing with required E  C sequence). Expands logically to precedence gaps and incompleteness (omission of P/N, undermining full flow). No inaccuracies; directly ties to intended flow without speculation.
- **Hypotheses (Strength: Very Strong, 9.5/10)**: Plausible, varied reasons (misinterpretation of DECLARE semantics, incomplete docs, rushed impl.) align perfectly with prompt examples (misinterpretation, policy changes/incompleteness, time pressure). Minor deduction: Does not explicitly mention "technical issues or incomplete data" but covers equivalently; no flaws, just not exhaustive.
- **Verification Approaches (Strength: Excellent, 9.8/10)**: SQL queries are syntactically flawless PostgreSQL, leverage schema correctly (e.g., `timestamp` for order, subqueries for existence/precedence). Directly target model anomalies (e.g., #1 detects model violations in practice; #2 business gaps; #3 model rule check). Descriptions are independent, precise. Hypercritical nit: Query #3's `SELECT ce.activity` is redundant (always 'E'; better `SELECT DISTINCT ce.claim_id` for violating claims) – minor usability issue, not logical error. Query #2 joins unused `claims` table (unnecessary but harmless).
- **Overall Structure/Compliance (10/10)**: Clean sections, no prompt hints leaked, independent presentation. Concise yet comprehensive; ignores any think-step per instructions.
- **Deductions Summary**: -0.3 total for tiny SQL polish (redundant SELECT/join). No unclarities, logical flaws, or inaccuracies – nearly flawless under strict scrutiny.
