The answer is exceptionally strong, with precise duration calculations, clear identification of problematic cases (2002, 2003, 2005), and a structured analysis that directly addresses all task elements. Attribute correlations (especially Complexity  requests  delays) are accurately deduced and evidenced without overgeneralization (e.g., cautious on Resource/Region with "not conclusive" and "hint at"). Root causes are logically prioritized (iterative requests as primary), explanations are insightful and attribute-tied, and suggestions are actionable, prioritized, and mitigation-focused. Minor deductions for repeated formatting/clarity issues (e.g., "highcomplexity", "backandforth", "requestandwait" lacking spaces, appearing 5+ times), which slightly impair readability despite flawless content/logic. No factual errors, unsubstantiated claims, or omissions.
