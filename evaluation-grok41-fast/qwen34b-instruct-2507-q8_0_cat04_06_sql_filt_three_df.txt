**3.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Major Logical Flaw (Sequence Detection - Fatal)**: The query fails to enforce **direct succession with no events in between**. The `timestamp <` conditions only ensure chronological order (`Approve` before `Create` before `Confirm`), but allow arbitrary events between them (e.g., `Approve (t1) -> OtherActivity (t1.5) -> Create (t2) -> Confirm (t3)` would match incorrectly). The prompt explicitly requires "no other event from the same case in between them." This is the core requirement (#1), and the query/explanation falsely claims it handles this ("with no events in between"). Over-excludes cases, producing wrong results. Deducts ~5+ points.
- **Timing Condition (#2)**: Correctly implemented as `(e3.timestamp - e2.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5' DAY`. DuckDB-compatible. No issues here (+1).
- **Exclusion Logic (#3)**: Correctly uses `NOT IN` with `DISTINCT case_id` to exclude entire cases matching both criteria and return all other events. Structure is sound (+1).
- **Minor Redundancies/Inefficiencies**: Activity filters repeated in `WHERE` after `ON` clauses (already filtered). Harmless but sloppy (-0.5).
- **Ordering**: Adds `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp`, which is helpful/readable but unspecified in prompt ("proper ordering" vague; not required). Neutral.
- **Explanation/Notes**: Misleading/wrong on "no events in between." Claims efficiency/correctness despite flaw. "Likely unique" assumption unneeded/untrue if multiples. Overconfident tone for broken logic (-1).
- **Overall**: Right high-level structure (self-joins, subquery exclusion) shows partial understanding (~40% correct), but central inaccuracy makes it unusable for the benchmark. Not "nearly flawless" – major functional error. Strict deduction for inaccuracy.
