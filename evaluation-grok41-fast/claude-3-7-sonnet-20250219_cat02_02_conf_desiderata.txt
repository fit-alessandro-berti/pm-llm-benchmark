**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is strong in structure, clarity, and coverage of *most* content, with logical flow, precise timestamps where used, and reasonable interpretations (Task 3). It correctly identifies Case 2 as the sole normative violator (Cases 1 and 3 compliant), accurately flags the two violations it notes, and handles desiderata delays well for Case 3. Summary is concise and balanced. However, under utmost strictness, **two major inaccuracies and one minor logical flaw prevent a higher score**—these are not minor oversights but clear failures to fully identify/analyze violations per the log and rules, warranting significant deduction (from 10.0 baseline: -1.5 for first major, -1.0 for second, -0.5 for inconsistency/minor):

1. **Major Inaccuracy (Task 1 - Normative Violations, Case 2)**: Completely misses the explicit skipping of "Inform Applicant," a **strict normative requirement** ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; sequence mandates it after Decision, before branching; "What is Not Allowed: Skipping activities"). Log shows Decision (09:30)  Finalize (10:00)  Close (10:30), with **no Inform at all**. This is a third, obvious violation (alongside sequence swap and post-rejection Finalize), compromising "explain the reasons" completeness. No justification or interpretation offered for this skip, despite Task 3 encouraging it "where possible." Hypercritical: This is a table-scan error on a core sequence step—renders Case 2 analysis incomplete/flawed.

2. **Major Inaccuracy (Task 2 - Desiderata, Case 1)**: Incorrectly labels as "**Fully compliant with desiderata**" despite **no Follow-up Call recorded** (log ends at Close Case; desiderata explicitly "encouraged... before closing the case," and failing/skipping = "fail to meet desiderata conditions," even if "not severe"). Answer qualifies it as "only encouraged," but still claims "fully compliant"—contradicts task to **identify failures** and clarify non-severity. Case 3 correctly flags it as a violation; this inconsistent treatment undermines objectivity.

3. **Minor Logical Flaw/Incompleteness (Task 2 - Desiderata, Case 2)**: States "Applicant notification timing is not specified" (implying assessable but unknown), but activity is **absent** (normative issue spillover). Fails to note this as an automatic desiderata failure ("informed promptly... within 48 hours"), especially since "promptly" can't apply to a skipped step. Minor, but adds to pattern of log oversight.

**No other flaws**: Timings calculated correctly (e.g., Case 3 delays); interpretations plausible/justified (e.g., weekends, training); no unclarities; no contradictions in compliant cases; distinguishes severity well. Nearly flawless *if not for the misses*, but strict rubric demands perfection on violation ID/explanation—7.0 reflects "good but critically incomplete" (e.g., 10.0 = zero misses; 9.0 = only trivial nitpicks like arrow encoding).
