**8.4**

### Reasoning for Grade
- **Accuracy (9.2/10)**: Strong match to the diagram's core flow—correctly identifies start ("Customer Information"), decision diamond ("Check," likely "Customer with parcel?"), branches (Yes to "Clarify shipment method," No to "Insure parcel always"), linear steps ("Write label," "Obtain quotes from 3 logistic companies," "Place order"), post-shipping decision (~"48h delivery?"), "Notify customer" on delay, and end ("Parcel ready"). Minor issues: Vague "proceed with investigation" (likely just flows to insure; no "investigation" in diagram); adds unmentioned "warehouse" and "ship the goods" (implied but not explicit box).
- **Completeness (8.8/10)**: Covers all major nodes/arrows, including specifics like "3 logistic companies" and "48 hours." Misses no key elements; good branch detail.
- **Clarity & Structure (7.8/10)**: Well-organized numbered list + summary; logical breakdown. Docked for typos/encoding artifacts (e.g., "8.<0xC2><0xA0>"), awkward phrasing (e.g., "proceed with investigation or offer different options"), and minor assumptions (e.g., "handed to customer/ready to pickup"—solid inference but interpretive).
- **Overall Quality (8.5/10)**: Insightful summary; reads as a professional process walkthrough. Not perfect due to small misreads/phrasing, but far above average for image description.
