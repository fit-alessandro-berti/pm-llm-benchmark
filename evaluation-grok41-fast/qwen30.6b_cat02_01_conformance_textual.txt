**2.0**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Factual Inaccuracies in Event Log Interpretation (Severe Penalty: -4.0)**: The answer fundamentally misreads the sequences:
  - Case 3: Claims "authorization precedes the check" — false; Check (09:20) precedes Authorize (09:40). Also ignores Ship after Cancel (clear violation per "never after a cancellation") and Authorize before Cancel (illogical for insufficient inventory branch).
  - Case 4: Invents non-existent "Ship order" ("Cancel order before Ship order") and "cancellation after authorization" — neither occurs (sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close, which is **conformant**). Falsely labels a perfect insufficient-inventory case as deviant.
  - Case 5: Claims "Authorize payment before Check inventory" — false; Check (10:00) precedes Authorize (10:30). Misses actual issues (no Package; Ship without Package, violating "Ship order" only after "Package items").
  - Entirely misses Case 2 violation: Package (10:00) before Authorize (10:30), directly breaching ""Authorize payment" ... before packaging" and ""Package items" should only occur after authorization".
- **Missed Violations (Severe Penalty: -2.0)**: Ignores Case 2 (clear sequence reversal). Case 5 has a violation (skipped Package/Ship out-of-order), but wrong reason given, so no credit.
- **Incomplete/Flawed Explanations (Severe Penalty: -1.5)**: References norm vaguely/incorrectly (e.g., Case 3 ties Cancel to "before packaging" without evidence; no mention of "Close order" as final or no fulfillment post-Cancel). No interpretation of ambiguities (e.g., skipping Package in Case 5). Case 1 implicitly cleared (correct), but Case 4 wrongly flagged erodes trust.
- **Structural/Logical Flaws (Moderate Penalty: -0.5)**: Lists "Identify Violations" with wrong timestamps/details; explanations contradict the list (e.g., Case 3 list vs. explanation). No comprehensive case-by-case check (Task 1 requires identifying **which cases** deviate; implies all others conform, but Case 2 doesn't).
- **Strengths (Minor Credit: +1.0)**: Attempts structured response (violations + explanations). Recognizes some sequence issues (e.g., auth-check order intent, post-Cancel issues partially). Case 3/5 flagged as deviant (half-credit for partial accuracy despite wrong facts).

**Overall**: Near-total failure due to pervasive factual errors and omissions; cannot reliably identify/explain deviations. Equivalent to random guessing with formatting. Only 2.0 avoids 1.0 floor as it gestures at real constraints (e.g., auth timing).
