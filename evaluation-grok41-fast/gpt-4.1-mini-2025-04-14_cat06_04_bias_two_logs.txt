**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (near-flawless elements)**: 
  - Accurately identifies **Group B log as exhibiting the bias**, correctly tying it to the presence of "+10 (Community Boost)" adjustments absent in Group A. This directly answers "which log exhibits bias."
  - Precisely describes manifestation: ScoreAdjustment column shows systematic +10 boosts in B for `LocalResident=TRUE` + `CommunityGroup` (e.g., U001, U003), influencing adjusted scores and decisions (e.g., U003: 695  705 Approved).
  - Correctly contrasts Group A (all `LocalResident=FALSE`, `CommunityGroup=None`, zero/N/A adjustments, decisions purely on preliminary scores: 720 Approved, 710 Rejected, 740 Approved).
  - Links attributes (`LocalResident`, `CommunityGroup`) to boosts, explaining systematic favoritism toward qualifying Group B applicants (e.g., lower raw score U003 approved vs. comparable rejections).
  - Notes consistent no-boost rejection parity (P002/U002 both 710 Rejected), highlighting boost as differentiator.
  - Structured, clear, comprehensive; covers all required elements (influence on decisions, systematic differences). No factual errors in log data citation.

- **Minor Issues (deducting 0.8 total)**:
  - Slight overstatement: "identical raw qualifications lead to disparate outcomes." No identical preliminary scores have disparate decisions (720 both Approved; 710 both Rejected). Disparity arises for *lower* raw in B (695  Approved). This is semantically imprecise ("identical" vs. "comparable/lower"), a logical stretch but not fundamentally wrong given context.
  - "Similarly scored" for P002 (710) vs. U003 (695/705) is marginally vague—705 is close but lower, and logs show 710 Rejected even in B (U002), emphasizing boost over score parity. Minor unclarity, as example still illustrates point effectively.
  - No major inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws; no misreads of timestamps/resources/decisions. Oddity of 705 Approved vs. 710 Rejected (potential implied threshold inconsistency) is per logs and not answer's fault—answer leverages it correctly without assuming causation beyond boost.

Nearly flawless under strict criteria; deductions only for wording precision in two spots. Lower scores (e.g., <9) reserved for factual errors or incomplete coverage.
