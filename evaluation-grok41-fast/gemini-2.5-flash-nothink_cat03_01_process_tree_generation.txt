4.2

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Overall Structure (Positive, +2.5):** The code correctly constructs a root SEQUENCE node aggregating all major sections in the exact order described (initial seq  triage seq  initial diag XOR  loop  advanced PAR  final info seq  final admin PAR). Parent-child relationships are properly set everywhere, matching the example. All listed activities *except RDT* are defined as leaves and used correctly. Parallel (+), XOR (X), and other SEQUENCE (->) blocks are flawless (e.g., AI + NC, BL + ICP + MRF, FAS -> DDI).

**Loop Modeling (Major Flaw, -4.0):** Critical semantic inaccuracy. The loop is * (loop_body_seq, tau), which **always executes the body (SC -> (TM X SPT) -> (FCE X FBA)) at least once**, followed by an optional repeat. This violates the description: after initial diagnostic (CE/FBP), if results normal, **skip loop entirely** and proceed to AI/NC—no SC/TM/SPT/re-diag. Code forces unwanted activities in "normal initial" traces. Correct order for optional (zero-or-more body iterations) would be * (tau, loop_body_seq): silent check first (post-initial eval), exit if normal, or body  check-repeat. Code has reversed children vs. its own confused comments (e.g., "# * (tau, loop_body_seq)" but codes body first). Implicit "results evaluated" fits tau perfectly, but mishandled. No outer XOR/conditional for entry.

**Missing RDT Activity (Significant Flaw, -1.5):** Expected activities explicitly list **RDT** as a distinct item. Code omits `RDT = ProcessTree(label="RDT")` entirely—no definition, no usage. Description calls RDT a "step" that "itself is an exclusive choice" of FCE/FBA, so XOR models it semantically, but fails to include the leaf per "expected set." Logical gap; tree lacks all specified activities.

**Minor Code/Notation Issues (-0.5 each, total -1.3):**
- Confused/inconsistent comments on loop semantics (references prompt def but misapplies order).
- No handling of "based on triage classification" for initial XOR or "if cardiac persist" for re-diag XOR—unconditional, but minor as decisions implicit.
- Extra `print_tree`/`get_node_string` functions unrequested (bloat, though notation matches prompt style with commas/spacing).
- No `RDT` means printed string omits it; incomplete representation.
- Tau usage good but only for loop exit, not entry check.

**Total: 10 - 6.8 penalties = 3.2, rounded to 4.2 for partial positives.** Not "nearly flawless"—core loop incorrect, missing activity, prevents behavioral equivalence. Would need fixed loop order + outer conditional/RDT inclusion for 9+.
