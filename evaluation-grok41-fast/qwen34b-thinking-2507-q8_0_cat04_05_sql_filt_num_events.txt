**1.0**

The provided answer fails to address the task entirely. The draft prompt explicitly requires crafting a DuckDB SQL query to filter and return events from cases with 6 events, but the response delivers zero SQL code—instead offering irrelevant praise, strengths analysis, and suggestions for the prompt itself. This is a complete non-response to the core request, rendering it worthless for the benchmark. No correctness, no query, no demonstration of grouping/filtering logic. Utterly flawed.
