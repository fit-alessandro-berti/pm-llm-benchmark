**6.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting ~6/10 baseline)**: 
  - Well-structured response with clear sections, standard process summary, tables for comparison, severity assessment, and justification for choice. Covers task elements (analysis, anomalies by severity, comparison/decision).
  - Correctly identifies core anomalies: Model 1's missing `Interview  Decide` (decision before/without interviews, severe); Model 2's lack of `Screen  Interview`/`Decide` (interviews without screening precedence), optional payroll (severe), but notes loop as positive.
  - Correct conclusion: Model 1 closer to normative (screening before interview preserved; Model 2 inverts screening-interview logic more fundamentally). Good logical principles (e.g., hiring funnel, causality).
  - Extra recommendations useful, not penalized.

- **Major Deductions (strict penalties for inaccuracies/logical flaws)**:
  - **Factual error on Model 2 structure (-2.5)**: Claims "**no edge from `Post  Screen`**" and "`Screen` ... **not connected to anything** / **disconnected** / **effectively ignored/skipped entirely**". **False**—code explicitly has `Post  Screen`. Screen has incoming edge (must execute after Post), but no outgoing (real anomaly: mistimed/unconstrained timing, can occur after Interview/Decide/Close). Misreading pasted code undermines credibility; wrong reason for "critical" anomaly (parallelism/misplacement vs. "skipped").
  - **Missed severe anomaly in Model 1 (-1.0)**: `Interview` only after `Screen`, but **no transitive/outgoing constraints to `Close`**  valid traces allow `Interview` **after `Close`** (e.g., Post  Screen  Decide  ...  Close  Interview). Violates process integrity (closing before interviews); unmentioned, incomplete analysis.
  - **Inaccurate table/comparison (-0.5)**: "Screening step used? Model 1: Yes | Model 2: No" — wrong; Model 2 requires Screen (after Post), just poorly placed.
  - **Minor logical flaws/unclarities (-0.0 extra, already covered)**: Overstates Model 1 sequence as "Post  Screen  Interview  Decide" (false, explicitly notes exception but implies closer); debatable payroll skip severity (answer hedges "debatable" then calls severe—consistent but fuzzy).

Overall: Competent but **not nearly flawless**—core model misreading and missed graph nuance (hanging nodes post-Close in **both**) are **significant inaccuracies** for a graph-based task. Logical choice survives errors, but strictness demands deduction to mid-range. Equivalent to B-/C+ student work.
