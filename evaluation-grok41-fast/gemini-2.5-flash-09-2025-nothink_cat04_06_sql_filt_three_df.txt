**10.0**

### Evaluation Summary
This answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It precisely addresses all requirements with correct logic, syntax valid for DuckDB, and no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. Minor stylistic notes (e.g., activity filters in ON vs. WHERE) do not impact correctness or clarity, and the added ORDER BY enhances usability without deviation.

### Strengths (Covering All Criteria)
- **Sequence Detection (Req. 1)**: Triple self-join with timestamp ordering (`t2.timestamp > t1.timestamp`, etc.) + pairwise `NOT EXISTS` for no intermediates perfectly enforces *direct succession* (exact order, no events between pairs). Handles multiples correctly (case excluded if *any* such sequence exists).
- **Timing Filter (Req. 2)**: `(ts_confirm - ts_create) > INTERVAL '5' DAY` is syntactically correct in DuckDB (interval arithmetic works as expected; syntax like `INTERVAL '5' DAY` parses validly).
- **Exclusion (Req. 3)**: `NOT IN` anti-join excludes *entire cases* meeting **both** conditions, returning *all events* from non-matching cases. Preserves original table structure (`SELECT *`).
- **Completeness**: CTEs modularize steps clearly. `DISTINCT` handles duplicate sequences per case. No grouping needed (correctly omitted).
- **Ordering**: `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` is "proper" (logical for event logs, stable output).
- **Edge Cases Handled**: 
  - Multiple sequences/triples per case: Excludes if 1 satisfies time >5 days (matches "cases that have this specific sequence *and* timing").
  - No sequence or time 5 days: Retained.
  - Timestamp equality: Strict `>` excludes simultaneous events (appropriate for "succession").
- **No Extraneous Logic**: No leaks (e.g., excludes only on both conditions), no assumptions beyond schema.

### Hypercritical Checks (No Deductions)
- **Syntax/Compatibility**: DuckDB-native (intervals, timestamps, `NOT EXISTS` efficient).
- **Performance**: Suboptimal scans possible in `NOT EXISTS` for huge tables, but irrelevant for correctness.
- **Style/Clarity**: Comments accurate; query self-documenting. No ambiguities.
- **Logical Soundness**: No false positives (e.g., non-direct matches blocked) or negatives. Cartesian risk mitigated by per-case filters + time/NOT EXISTS.
- **Prompt Fidelity**: Exact match—no over/under-filtering, returns "solely ... events from cases not filtered out."

This warrants maximum score: flawless execution.
