**9.4 / 10.0**

### Reasoning for Grade:
- **Strengths (excellent coverage, ~95% accuracy)**:
  - Accurately captures the overall structure: start ("Ship goods"), key decision diamonds (special handling, insurance), main paths (no/yes branches), sequences (clarify method  offers/select  label/package/paperwork), timer/delay notification, and end ("shipment prepared").
  - Correctly identifies roles/lanes: Dispatch (start), Secretary (core actions like clarify, offers, select/order, insurance check/insure, label), Warehouse (post-packaging pickup), Logistics (handover).
  - Includes precise details: 3 offers, 48-hour packaging timer, customer delay notification, paperwork.
  - Well-structured response: numbered steps, clear summary of decisions/flows/roles. Readable and comprehensive.

- **Minor Deductions (-0.6 total)**:
  - Slight flow imprecision in special handling "yes  no insurance" path: Diagram shows direct arrow from "no insurance" to "Package goods" (skipping explicit label), while answer implies label is universal post-selection. No-special path correctly notes label after select/order.
  - Warehouse role slightly interpretive: "Move to pickup area" aligns with arrow to Warehouse lane but isn't explicitly labeled; diagram implies handover/prep there.
  - Misses minor diagram elements like "Parcel with customer data" (pre-label?) and exact merge points, but doesn't misstate them.

This is a strong, professional analysis—near-perfect for most practical purposes, with only nitpicky diagram fidelity issues.
