**9.8**

The answer is exceptionally strong: it correctly identifies **Group B** as exhibiting bias, with precise evidence from the logs (e.g., exact score boosts for U001 and U003, comparisons to P001/P003/P002/U002). Manifestation is clearly articulated via discriminatory adjustment, unfair elevation of lower raw scores, and impact on decisions. Implications are comprehensive (unfair advantage, proxy for social capital, transparency/equity issues), logically tied to data without overreach. Structure enhances clarity. Minor deduction (-0.2) for slight overemphasis on U003's hiring implying a definitive "tilt" without explicit multi-score decision criteria in logs (hiring may weigh Skill/Personality more, e.g., U003's low 75/65 vs. others), introducing tiny unsubstantiated causality hint—hypercritically, this warrants a small flaw despite overall near-perfection.
