**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless in its analysis. It precisely identifies the XOR's bias mechanism—selection for D (via proxy criteria like local residency and community groups) grants a score uplift to applicants correlated with privileged demographics, while skip denies it to others. It correctly highlights opacity in XOR logic as enabling hidden proxies (e.g., ZIP codes correlating with race/class). Implications are rigorously discussed: disparate impact on marginalized/non-local groups (even non-protected ones like immigrants/renters), perpetuation of historical inequities (e.g., redlining), legal risks (ECOA/EU AI Act), detection challenges due to subtlety, and broader equity erosion. Logical structure is airtight, with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws; inferences are model-grounded and real-world calibrated. Recommendations enhance without detracting. Only a perfect match to the question's focus yields this score.
