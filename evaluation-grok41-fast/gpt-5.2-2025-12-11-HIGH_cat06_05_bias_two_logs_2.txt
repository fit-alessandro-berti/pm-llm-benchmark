**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless: precisely identifies Group B as biased due to the explicit +5 "Association Boost" rule absent in Group A; accurately details manifestation with correct score examples (e.g., U001: 6065; U003: 5863) and contrasts uniform Group A treatment; logically explains outcome impacts, proxy effects, and implications (procedural unfairness, disparate impact tied to LocalResident/Protected status, job-relatedness risks, compounding inequity) without overreach or inaccuracy. Structure is clear, concise, and comprehensive; no unclarities, logical flaws, or omissions relative to the query.
