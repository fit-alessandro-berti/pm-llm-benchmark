**6.0**

### Explanation of Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting Higher Score):** 
  - Clear structure matching the task (per-case analysis of normative violations with explanations, desiderata failures with clarification of non-severity/suboptimality, and interpretations/justifications).
  - Accurate on Case 1: No normative issues; correctly notes desiderata (follow-up missing, implied by absence).
  - Accurate on Case 2 normative violations #1 (Risk before Credit Check) and #2 (Finalize after rejection).
  - Accurate on Case 3: No normative issues; desiderata correctly listed (Credit Check delay, Inform delay per log annotation, follow-up).
  - Good interpretations: Professional, plausible justifications (e.g., admin error, resource constraints).

- **Fatal Flaws (Significantly Lowering Score):**
  - **Major Inaccuracy in Case 2 (Missed Normative Violation):** The log for Case 2 completely skips "Inform Applicant" after Loan Decision (required strictly: "Loan Decision  Inform Applicant"; "the applicant must be informed of the outcome"). This is a clear normative sequence skip/violation (like the ordering issue), not a desiderata issue. The answer buries it under Desiderata with a contradictory hedge ("strict rule requires... desiderata encourages"), failing to list it under Normative Violations. This is a logical flaw and incompleteness—Case 2 has **at least three** normative violations, not two.
  - **Unclarity/Overreach in Case 2 Desiderata:** Claims Credit Check "within 24 hours (08:20)"—typo/inaccurate (Credit Check is at 09:00, Risk at 08:20; still within 24h from App at 08:00, but sloppy).
  - **Minor Incompleteness Across Cases:** Follow-up Call is consistently treated as desiderata (correct), but log only explicitly notes absence for Case 3—not assumed correctly for 1/2 without justification (implied by omission, but could be clearer). No synthesis/summary of "which cases" violate (task #1/2 asks to "identify which cases").
  - **No Explicit Task Fulfillment Phrasing:** Does not start with crisp "Cases violating normative: 2; Desiderata failures: 1,2,3" etc.—disperses it per-case without overview.

- **Why Not Higher/Lower:** 6.0 reflects ~70% accuracy (strong structure/content, but core misidentification of a strict violation drags it down significantly per "hypercritical" rules). Not "nearly flawless" (major logical flaw prevents 9-10); not total failure (avoids 1-4).
