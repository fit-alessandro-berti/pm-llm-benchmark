**4.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies *Case 2* as the sole normative violator and *Case 3* as the sole desiderata violator (Case 1 implicitly clean). Lists violating cases clearly in Final Answer. Matches log-noted violations for Case 2 (sequence skip on Credit Check/Risk, post-rejection Finalize). Desiderata for Case 3 covers the three expected items (timings + follow-up), clarifies "suboptimal" in Step-by-Step. Brief interpretations provided as required.
- **Major Flaws (severe deductions)**:
  - **Missed normative violation in Case 2**: Skips "Inform Applicant" entirely (required after *every* Loan Decision per sequence/constraints: "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed..."; "Skipping activities... not allowed"). This is a clear sequence skip, independent of other issues—third violation unmentioned, making explanation incomplete/inaccurate.
  - **Factual inaccuracies in timings (Step-by-Step, influencing conclusions)**:
    | Issue | Claimed | Actual Calculation | Error |
    |-------|---------|--------------------|-------|
    | Case 3 Credit Check | "13 days + 10 hours" (>24h desideratum) | Jan-12 09:00 to Jan-14 10:00 = ~49 hours | Gross exaggeration (13 days vs. 2 days); undermines credibility. |
    | Case 3 Inform Applicant | "**46+ hours**" (>48h desideratum) | Jan-14 12:00 to Jan-16 15:00 = ~51 hours | Underestimate (46 vs. 51); imprecise. |
    These are not "minor"—they're core to desiderata analysis and directly contradict log timestamps.
  - **Unclarities/logical flaws**: Final Answer claims exactly "two violations" for Case 2 (boxed), but even without missed Inform, Case 2 arguably has overlapping sequence issues (Risk before Credit *and* Credit after Risk/Decision without proper order). No explicit confirmation Case 1/Case 2 have no desiderata issues (e.g., Case 1/2 implicitly miss follow-up call, per desiderata encouragement; Case 2 Credit Check ~1.3h ok but unaddressed). Interpretations superficial/vague ("log errors... process misunderstanding"), not insightful.
- **Overall**: ~60% accurate but with critical omissions/inaccuracies preventing "nearly flawless." Strict policy demands significant penalty for these (missed rule + factual errors = non-trivial flaws). Not 10.0 (flawless), not even 7.0 (minor issues only).
