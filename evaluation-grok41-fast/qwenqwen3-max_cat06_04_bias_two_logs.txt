**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**: Excellently identifies Group B's log as exhibiting bias (+1.5), correctly pinpoints the core disparate impact (U003 at 705 adjusted approved vs. P002 at 710 rejected, despite 705 < 710 < 720) (+1.5), infers reasonable threshold (~720 based on Group A/U002) (+1.0), links to LocalResident=TRUE and CommunityGroup properly in most places (+1.0), discusses proxy discrimination, systemic inequity, and mitigation well (+1.0), structured clearly with tables/key observations (+1.0), concludes precisely on manifestation via score inflation/lower effective thresholds (+1.2). Approval rates same (2/3) but highlights *how* bias manifests via unequal score treatment—nearly flawless on core logic.
- **Penalties (deductions for strictness)**: 
  - **Major inaccuracy**: Section 3 states "Community Boost is consistently applied **only when CommunityGroup  None**"—factually wrong/backwards (boost applies when *not* None, as U001/U003 have "Highland Civic Darts Club," U002 has None and gets 0; contradicts own earlier correct observation) (-1.0). Undermines "Inconsistent Application" claim.
  - **Minor logical flaw/unclarity**: "LocalResidents and/or affiliated" imprecisely suggests LocalResident alone suffices (U002 disproves; requires both) (-0.3). Speculative threshold explanations (e.g., "boost applied *after* threshold check") ignore log sequence (boost at PreliminaryScoring, before FinalDecision) (-0.3).
  - **Minor overstatements**: Claims "systematic scoring advantage" for *whole* Group B despite U002 mirroring Group A exactly (no boost/rejected); bias is subgroup-specific within B (-0.2). "Unjustified score inflation" good but assumes irrelevance without evidence (-0.2). Typo/formatting in quote block ("710  Rejected") (-0.1).
- **Overall**: ~85% flawless (strong analysis of key disparity, policy critique), but factual error in boost condition is non-trivial inaccuracy requiring deduction. Not "nearly flawless" (requires 9.5+). Rounded to 1 decimal.
