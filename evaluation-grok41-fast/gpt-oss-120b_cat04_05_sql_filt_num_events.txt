**10.0**

The provided SQL query is correct, efficient, and precisely matches the requirements: it uses a CTE to compute event counts per `case_id`, joins back to the original table, filters on `event_cnt <= 6` (excluding >6), and returns all columns (`el.*`) for qualifying cases. The optional `ORDER BY` is logical for event logs but does not alter correctness. The explanation accurately describes the logic without errors or omissions. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws detected.
