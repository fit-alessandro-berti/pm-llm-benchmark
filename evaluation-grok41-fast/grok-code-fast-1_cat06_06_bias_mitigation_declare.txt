7.2

**Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):**

- **Strengths (why not lower):** Format is perfectly preserved and valid Python code. Additions follow exact dict structure for unary/binary constraints. New activities (CheckSensitiveAttribute, BiasMitigationCheck, ManualReview) align with prompt examples/suggestions. Constraints semantically mitigate bias logically: response forces mitigation after sensitive check; succession enforces BiasMitigationCheck before *every* FinalDecision (strong fairness); nonchainsuccession correctly forbids direct chain from sensitive check to decision; coexistence adds redundancy but fits. Rationale lists each addition with bias-reduction explanation. Overall output structure matches (code + explanations).

- **Flaws Penalized (strict deductions):**
  - **Logical inaccuracy in rationale vs. constraint effect (major, -1.5):** Existence["ManualReview"] *unconditionally* mandates it in *all* traces (support=1.0), but rationale claims "in every trace where sensitive applicants are involved" — falsely implying conditionality tied to sensitive attributes. No mechanism distinguishes sensitive vs. non-sensitive traces (e.g., no existence or responded_existence for CheckSensitiveAttribute), so this over-enforces generally, not bias-specifically. Coexistence rationale also overclaims "especially for sensitive cases."
  - **Incomplete bias targeting (medium, -0.8):** Prompt emphasizes decisions like "Approve, Reject" influenced by "ApplicantRace: Minority" (suggesting e.g., Reject_Minority or direct ties), but sticks to generic FinalDecision without splitting (e.g., no Reject-specific non-succession after CheckApplicantRace). Relies on new activities without ensuring their existence/occurrence in sensitive paths (e.g., no existence["CheckSensitiveAttribute"], risking non-enforcement if traces skip it).
  - **Redundancy/minor overkill (minor, -0.3):** Existence + coexistence for ManualReview is logically redundant (both at 1.0 force mutual presence). Succession for BiasMitigationCheck implies existence/precedence, but no explicit existence entry (inconsistent with unary pattern for new act.).
  - **Unclarity in semantics (minor, -0.2):** "nonchainsuccession" rationale says "direct succession" — assumes correct DECLARE semantics (forbids chain/immediate), but prompt lists "nonchainsuccession" without defining; fine if standard, but hypercritically, not explicitly verified. No ties to other prompt ex. (e.g., RequestAdditionalInfo unchanged).

Nearly good (8+ would require flawless conditional logic, no overclaims, precise sensitive-activity splits), but flaws make it not "nearly flawless."
