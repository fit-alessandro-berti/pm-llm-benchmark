**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (Supporting ~8/10 base)**:
  - **Structure and Completeness**: Flawlessly mirrors the task's 3-part structure. Includes summary table and conclusion for clarity. Covers all specified anomalies (loop, XOR skip, premature closure) plus insightful extras (e.g., A->C edge specifics). Hypotheses align perfectly with prompt examples (business changes, miscommunication, technical errors, constraints). Instances match prompt query suggestions (premature closure, multiple approvals, skipped N).
  - **Part 1 (Anomalies)**: Precise, accurate to POWL code (e.g., LOOP semantics "* (E, P)" allowing repeats; XOR with skip; missing xor->C edge + A->C enabling concurrency/prematurity). No inaccuracies.
  - **Part 2 (Hypotheses)**: Plausible, diverse, business-relevant. Ties directly to model flaws (e.g., rushed loop exit logic).
  - **Part 3 Intent**: Correctly leverages tables (`claim_events.activity`/`timestamp` for sequencing, `claims.claim_id`). Simple queries (multiple 'P') are flawless. Anti-patterns for anomalies (e.g., C before E/P via row_number/ANY) show conceptual grasp.

- **Fatal Flaws (Deductions: -0.8 total, preventing 8+)**:
  - **SQL Inaccuracies/Unrunnability (Major: -0.5)**:
    | Issue | Example | Impact |
    |-------|---------|--------|
    | Wrong columns | All queries use `e.label` (nonexistent; schema is `activity`). `event_time` (nonexistent; it's `timestamp`). | Code fails to execute; ignores schema. |
    | Logical/syntax errors | First query: `MIN(e.label = 'E') < MIN(e.label = 'C')` — MIN(boolean) nonsense; no timestamps involved. No notification query: INNER JOIN e1(N)+e2(C) w/ `HAVING COUNT(*)=0` selects **nothing useful** (claims w/o N-before-C vanish; HAVING excludes those with pairs). A-before-R: Incomplete (`e.timestamp` undefined). | Core verification fails; misleading. |
    | Incomplete/ineffective | Row_number query approximates but misses multiples (e.g., late E after early C); no `EXISTS`/`NOT EXISTS` for "no E/P before any C". Notification misses "before closure" properly (should correlate per-claim last C). Adjusters table unused despite schema. | Hypotheses unverifiable as written. |
  - **Unclarities/Overconfidence (-0.2)**: "Simplification; refine later" excuses errors. Adds unprompted "A before R" (model has R->A, so valid but extraneous). Assumes `activity='C'` etc. without mapping confirmation (minor, but schema uses VARCHAR `activity` matching labels).
  - **Minor Logical Gaps (-0.1)**: Doesn't tie queries to adjusters (e.g., premature closure by unqualified adjuster via `specialization`/`resource`). Loop hypothesis verified only via multiple P (ignores multiple E).

- **Why Not Lower?** Conceptual accuracy redeems (e.g., timestamps for order, per-claim partitioning). Not "criminal" errors—just sloppy execution on ~40% of queries.
- **Why Not Higher?** Queries are task's technical core; broken SQL = "inaccuracies" warranting "significantly lower." Not "nearly flawless."
