**7.0**

The final POWL model is well-structured, with correct use of StrictPartialOrder to chain sequential components, appropriate OperatorPOWL for loops and XOR choice, proper silent transition for optional LB (accurately capturing skip in case 2), and correct sequencing of OR-MS-QS, PK-DP-D, and testing loop *(TST, RT) that perfectly fits cases 1,2,3,4,5 for testing/re-testing. Code is syntactically flawless, imports correct, nodes and order edges precisely define the linear flow without unnecessary concurrency. Explanation is clear and mostly accurate.

However, deducting significantly for logical flaw in loop_assembly_qc = *(AS, IQC): this generates only traces AS (IQC AS)* (e.g., AS; AS IQC AS; AS IQC AS IQC AS), fitting cases 1,2,4,5 but failing case 3 (AS IQC IQC AS IQC AS, with consecutive IQCs and mismatched AS/IQC count of 3 each, impossible under LOOP semantics requiring #AS = #IQC + 1). Model cannot replay full event log, violating "captures these relationships" and explanation's claim of covering "all observed behaviors." This core inaccuracy warrants deduction despite strong overall design.
