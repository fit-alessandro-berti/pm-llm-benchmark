**7.0**

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting score above 5.0)**:
  - Correct overall process interpretation: Linear sequence RO  CA  RI  PI  QC  PO  GSL  D  IC, with RP optional after IC. Matches scenario perfectly.
  - `activ_freq`: Flawless. `{1}` for mandatory activities, `{0,1}` for RP. Directly aligns with definitions and scenario.
  - `never_together`: Correctly empty—no exclusions implied.
  - `directly_follows`: Perfect. Only consecutive mandatory pairs, excludes RP correctly.
  - `always_before` and `always_after`: Logically sound full transitive closures. Includes RP's dependencies correctly (e.g., `('RP', 'IC')`). No extras or misses.
  - Reasoning tables and key decisions: Clear, logical, highlight RP optionality well.
  - Code syntax/ structure: Valid Python (multiline sets with comments parse correctly).
  - Comprehensiveness: Explicit transitive pairs ensure declarative enforcement without relying on inference.

- **Fatal Inaccuracies/Flaws (capping at 7.0, not higher)**:
  - **`equivalence` fundamentally incorrect/incomplete (major deduction: -2.0+)**: 
    - Lists only 36 forward/upper-triangle pairs (earlier  later activities), omitting all 36 reverse pairs (later  earlier).
    - Definition requires: "If the **first** activity occurs, then it has **the same occurrences** as the **second** one." For true equivalence (same counts bidirectionally), **both** `('A', 'B')` **and** `('B', 'A')` needed for every pair among the 9 mandatory activities.
    - Example violation: `('IC', 'RO')` missing. If IC occurs (1), no equivalence constraint forces RO to exactly 1 occurrence (though `always_before`/`activ_freq` cover it indirectly). This fails to "represent" full equivalence as claimed in reasoning ("each pair co-equivalent").
    - Redundant/overkill anyway (`activ_freq` already enforces {1} everywhere), but including partial set introduces inaccuracy—misrepresents constraint. Should be full 72 directed pairs, minimal generators (e.g., chain), or empty (no special equivalence beyond freq/order).
  - **Logical redundancy flaw (minor deduction: -0.5)**: Massive transitive closures in `always_before`/`always_after` (~36 pairs each) correct but bloated/non-minimal. Declarative models often use direct edges (inferred transitive); explicit overkill risks implying unnecessary strictness without gain.
  - **Minor unclarities (minor deduction: -0.5)**: Reasoning claims "all pairs co-equivalent" but delivers half. No explanation why partial/one-way.

- **Why not lower?** Other 5/6 keys flawless; equivalence flaw doesn't break overall model (other constraints compensate practically). Code executable and scenario-faithful.
- **Why not 9.0+?** Not "nearly flawless"—equivalence is ~50% wrong, direct contradiction of definition/reasoning. Strict policy demands "significantly lower" for inaccuracies.
