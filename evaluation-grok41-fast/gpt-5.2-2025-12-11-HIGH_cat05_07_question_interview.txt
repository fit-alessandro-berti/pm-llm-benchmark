**9.2**

### Evaluation Summary
This is an exceptionally strong response—comprehensive, precisely aligned with the prompt's goals, and hyper-focused on conceptual deepening without veering into forbidden areas like SQL or implementation code. It systematically uncovers missing details (e.g., Q6-13 on docs/database), decision criteria (e.g., Q14,29,38,41), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q3-4,9,39), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q10,16,22,31,54,61), and exceptions (e.g., Q5,8,26,28,56-57). All 66 questions are open-ended ("What," "How," "Who"), targeted to the described process, and build logically from start-to-end with no redundancies or irrelevancies.

### Minor Deductions (Hypercritical Breakdown, Preventing 10.0)
- **Excessive volume (0.4 deduction)**: 66 questions is a "series," but borders on exhaustive bombardment rather than a prioritized, interview-practical list. Targeted implies concise selection of highest-impact probes; this feels like a complete audit checklist, potentially overwhelming the interviewee and diluting focus (e.g., Q64 on data privacy is insightful but stretches beyond explicitly described elements like docs/leases).
- **Occasional leading phrasing/slightly closed elements (0.3 deduction)**: A few questions include suggestive lists/examples that could bias responses (e.g., Q3 lists exact roles; Q14 weights criteria explicitly from description; Q18 specifies "lease clauses, internal notes..."). These are still open-ended but subtly guide, reducing pure openness vs. e.g., "How are special conditions captured and made actionable?"
- **Minor sequencing gaps/logical overreach (0.1 deduction)**: Q65-66 extend logically to edge cases/post-onboarding, but Q66's "formal transition... artifacts handed over" assumes a handoff not emphasized in the description, introducing a tiny speculative probe.

No inaccuracies (all tie directly to description), unclarities (crystal-clear wording), or logical flaws (progressive flow from docs  assignment  inspection  marketing  leasing  audits/exceptions). Flawless adherence to no-SQL/conceptual-only. A 10.0 requires zero nits; this is 99% perfect.
