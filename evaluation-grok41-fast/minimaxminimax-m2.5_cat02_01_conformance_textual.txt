The provided answer is nearly flawless. It accurately identifies exactly the violating cases (2, 3, and 5) with no false positives or misses. All explanations are precise, directly reference the normative description's constraints and flows (e.g., sequences, ordering rules like Authorize before Package, Ship only after Package and never after Cancel, direct Cancel after Check for insufficient inventory), and resolve ambiguities logically without introducing errors. Structure is clear and comprehensive (expected flows, constraints, per-case violations with explanations, non-violations, summary). No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or logical flaws—even minor ones. Case 3 correctly highlights multiple targeted violations without over- or under-stating (e.g., Authorize before Cancel as path error, Ship after Cancel as forbidden). Case 5 nails the missing Package. Perfect adherence to task.
