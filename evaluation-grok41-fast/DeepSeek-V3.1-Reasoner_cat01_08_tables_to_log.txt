**9.5**

### Reasoning for Grade
This answer is excellent overall and nearly flawless, warranting a very high score. It fully meets the prompt's requirements:
- **Complete coverage**: All 5 orders (cases) are included with every available event (Order Created, all individual Item Picked per line, all Dispatched/Arrived per delivery record, all Invoice Issued, all Payment Received). Nothing missed; order 1004 correctly limited to available data (no delivery/invoice/payment).
- **Correct structure**: Markdown table with exact required columns (Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource/Actor, Other Attributes). Events grouped by case and strictly chronological within each case (verified all timestamps flow logically, e.g., picks before dispatches, arrivals before invoices, invoices before payments).
- **Accurate data mapping**: Timestamps exact from source tables. Activities logically derived as per examples (e.g., per-item picks, per-delivery dispatch/arrive, per-invoice/payment). Keys linked perfectly (order_id  invoice_id  payment_id).
- **Enrichment**: Superb use of Products (item_category) and Resources (human names for sales, pickers, billers, carriers). N/A for payments correct (no data). Relevant additional attributes per event type (e.g., quantity/item for picks, amounts for invoices, notes/methods where applicable).
- **Chronology and logic**: Real process flow preserved per case. Multiples handled as separate events meaningfully.
- **Documentation**: Assumptions and notes clear, addressing missing data (e.g., order 1004).

**Minor deductions (-0.5)** for hypercritical accuracy:
- One data transcription inaccuracy: 1005 Order Dispatched "delivery_note: Fragile items" truncates original "Fragile items, handle with care" (incomplete attribute value).
- No other issues: No missing events, no wrong timestamps/resources, no logical flaws (e.g., picking without dispatch is data-driven), no unclarities, table readable/structured perfectly. Extras like assumptions/notes enhance without violating format.

Nearly flawless; flawless would be 10.0 with exact attribute text.
