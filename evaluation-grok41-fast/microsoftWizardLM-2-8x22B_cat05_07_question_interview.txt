### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—comprehensive, directly aligned with the prompt's goals (missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, exceptions), and strictly adheres to producing open-ended, conceptual questions without any SQL or low-level implementation requests. It covers the process description thoroughly, grouping logically for clarity (enhancing usability without detracting). All 15 questions are targeted, phrased openly (e.g., "How...", "What...", "Can you describe..."), and probe exactly the required areas:
- **Missing details/decision criteria**: Q1-2,6,8,10 (e.g., criteria for docs, pricing models).
- **Roles/responsibilities**: Q3-4,15 (e.g., evaluation process, handoffs).
- **Timing/sequencing**: Q2,5,7,14 (e.g., turnaround times, activation steps, timeline).
- **Exceptions**: Q5,9,12 (e.g., failed inspections, custom clauses, protocols).

**Strengths (near-flawless elements)**:
- No inaccuracies or logical flaws; every question ties back to the process description without hallucinating or straying.
- Conceptual focus: Even Q11 (tools) stays high-level ("how do they integrate"), building on the description's mention of CRMs/tools without demanding code/configs.
- No overreach into forbidden areas.
- Excellent depth/breadth without redundancy; 15 questions form a "series" that's efficient yet exhaustive.
- Polite, professional tone; intro/closing add value without violating "produce a list."

**Minor Deductions (strictly applied, preventing 10.0)**:
- Q14 requests a "flowchart" alongside timeline—minor logical flaw, as interviews are verbal; a flowchart is an artifact, not pure conceptual clarification (0.4). Rephrase to "describe the sequence/timing" would be flawless.
- Q11/Q13 slightly expansive: Tool names/integration (Q11) edges toward specifics (though conceptual and prompted by desc); continuous improvement (Q13) adds value but isn't core to prompt's 5 goals (0.2 each). Hypercritical, but negligible as they deepen process understanding.
- Extra framing ("Certainly!", closing sentence, bold headers): Unrequested polish; pure list would be leaner (0.2 total).

Nearly flawless (92%): Zero major issues, exhaustive coverage, zero violations. Any lower would be unjustifiably harsh given perfection in core mandate.
