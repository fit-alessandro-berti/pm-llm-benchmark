The provided answer is flawless. Both queries (CTE with JOIN and IN subquery) precisely and correctly implement the requirement: they group by `case_id`, filter groups where `COUNT(*) <= 6` using `HAVING`, and return all columns (`*`) for events in qualifying cases only. DuckDB fully supports this standard SQL. No syntax errors, logical flaws, inefficiencies, or unclarities. The explanation accurately describes the mechanics without extraneous details. Providing alternatives enhances completeness without detracting.
