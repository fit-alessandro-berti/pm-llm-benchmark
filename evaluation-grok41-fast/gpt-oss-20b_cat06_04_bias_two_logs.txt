**7.2**

The answer correctly identifies Group B's log as exhibiting bias, accurately attributes it to the ScoreAdjustment (+10 Community Boost) tied to CommunityGroup (absent in Group A), and notes the correlation with unprotected status/LocalResident=TRUE, leading to systematically higher adjusted scores and approvals for boosted cases (e.g., U001 at 730, U003 at 705). The table crisply summarizes key differences, and the conclusion properly frames this as disparate impact/disadvantage to protected applicants (Group A, no boosts despite comparable/better raw scores like P001's 720).

However, hypercritical deductions for:
- **Factual inaccuracy in evidence**: Claims "both groups see one approval and one rejection when scores are identical or very close (710)" – false. No approvals occur at/near 710 (P002/U002 both rejected at exactly 710); Group B shows *zero* no-boost approvals (only U002 rejection), while Group A has *two* no-boost approvals (P001/P003). This misrepresents data balance and overstates "matching outcomes" without boost.
- **Weak/misleading comparisons**: U001 vs. P001 valid but both approve (hypothetical 725 threshold speculative/unfounded). U003 vs. P003 poor match (740 raw vs. 695 raw). Misses stronger evidence like U003's 705 approval vs. P002's 710 rejection (direct cross-group disparity despite Rules Engine).
- **Under-discusses LocalResident**: Notes difference but doesn't analyze potential interaction (e.g., TRUE only in Group B, possibly enabling CommunityGroup/boost; no exploration of its influence per question).
- **Minor unclarity/logic gaps**: Hypotheticals assume unknown thresholds; implies "only difference" is boost but LocalResident always differs; doesn't quantify systematic differences (e.g., 2/2 boosted approvals in B vs. 0 opportunities in A; raw 695 likely rejected per 710 precedent).

Core logic sound but evidentiary flaws prevent near-flawlessness.
