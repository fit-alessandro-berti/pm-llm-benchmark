**9.7**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—comprehensive, precisely on-topic, logically airtight, and analytically deep—but deducts minor points for two small issues under utmost strictness: (1) slight overreach in attributing bias to Steps 1–2 (valid generally, but the process description provides no textual basis for bias there beyond generic automation, making it a minor extrapolation despite the caveat); (2) inclusion of unrequested "practical mitigations" adds value but marginally dilutes focus on the core question (identification, justifiability, implications), risking perception as padding. No factual inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws; all claims directly tie to the description with precise mechanisms, evidence-based critiques (e.g., disparate impact via correlation, UDAAP risks), and balanced justifiability criteria. Structure enhances clarity; implications fully address fairness/equity for non-protected groups and proxies. Nearly flawless for a 10.0, but hyperstrictness demands perfection in scope adherence.
