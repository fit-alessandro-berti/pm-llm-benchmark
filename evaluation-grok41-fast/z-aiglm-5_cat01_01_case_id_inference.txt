The final answer provides a complete, accurate, and unambiguous grouping of all 18 events into exactly three distinct cases, with every event assigned precisely once based on the unique patient_age + patient_gender identifiers ((45,M), (62,F), (28,M)). Timestamps are strictly increasing within each case, departments and activities form coherent clinical workflows (e.g., ER injury path for 45M linking X-ray leg to fracture diagnosis; ER infection path for 62F linking labs to antibiotics; surgery path for 28M), and additional_info cross-references logically (e.g., triage codes post-registration, knee surgery reason to arthroscopy). The structure is clear (cases labeled with patient descriptors, event lists with timestamps/departments, and explicit grouping logic), with no omissions, contradictions, ambiguities, or extraneous content.
