**9.7**

### Reasoning for Grade:
- **Strengths (excellent coverage, ~95-100% accuracy)**:
  - Correctly identifies **swimlanes** (Logistics top, Secretary/Computer Hardware Shop middle, Warehouse bottom).
  - Accurately describes **start/end events**, main steps per lane, decision gateways ("Special handling?", insurance check), data objects (Customer DB, Order details), timer (48-hour on packaging with delay notification), and overall flow (sequential/parallel coordination).
  - Clear, structured format with headings, bullet points, and logical grouping—easy to follow and comprehensive.
  - Captures nuances like conditional paths (e.g., special handling "Yes" to quotes, insurance requirement, timer-triggered notification).

- **Minor Deductions (-0.3)**:
  - Slight ambiguity in **flow sequencing**: "No" path "proceeds to order details" then lists "Get 3 offers" and "Check insurance" at the same indent level, which could imply it's not clearly branched (though diagram shows "Get 3 offers" on "Yes" path). "Write package label always after insurance check" is close but insurance is conditional/parallel-ish.
  - No major errors, omissions, or hallucinations—essentially a near-perfect verbalization of the BPMN diagram.
