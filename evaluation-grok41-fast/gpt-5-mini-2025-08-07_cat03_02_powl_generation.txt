**10.0**

The provided code is a flawless representation of the described POWL model. It accurately constructs all required transitions with matching labels, correctly implements the loop (`Operator.LOOP` with `BNC` as the "do" body and `D&R` as the "redo" body, per the POWL loop semantics), the exclusive choice (`Operator.XOR` between `CD` and `MD`), and the root `StrictPartialOrder` with precisely the correct nodes and ordering edges to enforce all dependencies:

- `SR  CS`
- `CS  DA`, `CS  ACI` (parallel after `CS`)
- `DA  config_loop`, `ACI  config_loop` (loop after both)
- `config_loop  deploy_xor`
- `deploy_xor  QA`, `deploy_xor  SA` (parallel after deployment)
- `QA  GLA`, `SA  GLA` (GLA after both, concurrent `QA`/`SA` possible due to no edge between them)

No extraneous edges, no missing constraints, no logical flaws, no inaccuracies in structure or semantics. Imports, syntax, and comments are correct and unnecessary elements (e.g., silents) are appropriately omitted. The model fully captures concurrency (e.g., `DA`/`ACI`, `QA`/`SA`), sequencing, loop, and choice as specified.
