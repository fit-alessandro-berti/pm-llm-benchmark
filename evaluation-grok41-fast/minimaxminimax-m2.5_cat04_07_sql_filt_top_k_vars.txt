The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It fully satisfies all four task requirements with a correct, efficient, readable DuckDB SQL query using CTEs:

- Correctly builds per-case ordered sequences via `string_agg(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp)` (exact match for requirement 1; string representation is stable and groupable without parsing issues).
- Groups by sequence and counts frequencies (requirement 2–3).
- Identifies top K (hardcoded 3 with explicit instruction to adjust/parameterize; handles ordering correctly via `ORDER BY case_count DESC` propagating to `LIMIT`).
- Returns precisely the filtered events from `event_log` (requirement 4: all original rows for matching cases only, excluding others; schema preserved for core columns via explicit `e.case_id, e.activity, e.timestamp`, with optional extras clearly labeled and non-disruptive).

No logical flaws (joins correctly filter cases without data loss/duplication errors; order stable). No inaccuracies (DuckDB syntax perfect; `string_agg` robust). No unclarities (step-by-step breakdown, table, enhancements cover edge cases like ties/parameters). Minor additions (extra columns, K=3) are explicitly optional/helpful and do not violate requirements. Runs correctly as-is.
