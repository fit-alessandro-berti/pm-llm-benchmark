The answer correctly identifies exactly the violating cases (2, 3, and 5) with no omissions or false positives. All explanations in the final summary precisely reference the normative description's constraints (e.g., sequences for sufficient/insufficient inventory, "directly proceed to Cancel," "only after packaged," "payment only makes sense once sufficiency known," no fulfillment after cancel). It appropriately interprets ambiguities (e.g., Authorize before Cancel as violation per "directly" and logical prerequisites) without overreaching. Case 3's dual violations are accurately distinguished and justified. Structure is clear, no logical flaws, unclarities, or inaccuracies in conclusions.
