**8.0**

### Evaluation Summary
The submitted answer provides a solid revision of the original draft prompt, improving structure, readability, and emphasis through numbered objectives and explicit guidance on output. It maintains the core task (crafting a SQL query to filter cases by event count 6 using grouping) while adding helpful column descriptions and a clear call to action. However, under hypercritical scrutiny, several minor but notable flaws prevent a higher score:

- **Schema inaccuracy**: Original specifies "at least the following columns," acknowledging potential additional columns common in event logs (e.g., `resource`, `status`). Revised changes to "the following key columns" and explicitly states "all columns (`case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`)," implying these are exhaustive. This could mislead responders to use `SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp` instead of `SELECT *` for "full set of events," introducing a logical flaw in generality and precision.
- **Unclarity in output specification**: "Full details of the events" conflicts slightly with listing only three columns as "all columns," creating ambiguity about whether to return all table columns or just the named ones.
- **Extraneous content**: The answer wraps the prompt with meta-commentary ("Here’s a well-drafted prompt for the benchmark:", "This version emphasizes clarity..."). This is unnecessary fluff for a clean draft submission, diluting focus and violating the expectation of presenting just the refined prompt.
- **Minor omissions**: Drops "or 'case'" explanation (trivial) and original's polite "Please craft," but more importantly, loses the subtle nudge "Be sure to consider the correct grouping and filtering," slightly weakening the hint at common pitfalls (e.g., row-level vs. case-level filtering).

These issues, while minor individually, compound to make the prompt not *nearly flawless*—it risks suboptimal SQL responses in a benchmark context. A 10.0 would require perfect fidelity to the original's generality, zero ambiguity, and no extra text. This is a strong 8.0: clearly better than the original in polish but penalized significantly per instructions for the flaws.
