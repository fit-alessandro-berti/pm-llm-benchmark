This answer is exceptional: fully accurate, comprehensive, and structured for clarity. It precisely describes all diagram elements (lanes, events, tasks, gateways with correct types/symbols, data objects/stores, timer loop), flow logic (parallel split/join, XOR decisions, conditional paths), and sequence without omissions or errors. The plain-English summary adds value, confirming deep understanding. No inaccuracies visible against the diagram.
