**9.8**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—structured, precise, insightful, and directly responsive to all task elements—but deducts 0.2 for minor non-critical issues under utmost strictness: (1) trivial table formatting glitch ("Start  End" lacks clear separation/pipe, forcing minor parsing effort); (2) durations use calendar hours without explicitly noting/contrasting business hours (e.g., overnight waits dominate but aren't quantified separately, though implied); (3) 2002's "medium" complexity framed as "orders of magnitude" delay without quantifying multiplier precisely in text (though calcs are exact). No inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities; analysis is data-driven, hypotheses appropriately caveated (e.g., small sample for region/resource), mitigations tightly linked and actionable. Covers all attributes comprehensively with flawless duration math, rework counting, and causal inference. Near-perfect execution.
