**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**:
  - **Anomalies Identification (Perfect: 10/10)**: Precisely matches model (loop via `* (E, P)`, XOR skip on N, partial order `A  C` bypassing loop/XOR). No extras or misses.
  - **Hypotheses (Excellent: 9.5/10)**: Table format clear; hypotheses directly align with prompt examples (business rule changes, miscommunication, technical errors, inadequate constraints). Concise, relevant (e.g., "workaround for disputed claims", "misconfiguration").
  - **Structure & Completeness (Flawless: 10/10)**: Sections mirror task exactly. Key Insights add value without fluff. Professional formatting.
  - **Queries Overall (Strong but Flawed: 7.5/10)**:
    - **Loop (7/10)**: First query correctly detects P  E (loop evidence). Second is **identical copy-paste error** (same SQL) with accurate label ("P before E" fits anomaly), but duplication is sloppy/unnecessary redundancy.
    - **Skip Notification (9/10)**: Robust; correctly finds P  C with no intervening N using timestamp bounds and NOT EXISTS. Minor nit: Assumes single P-C pair (multi-P cases might undercount), but logically sound.
    - **Premature Closure (6/10)**: First query flawless (C without any E/P). Second query **logically flawed**: Detects *any* A before *any* C (normal for most traces), not "immediately after" (requires no intermediate events, e.g., `NOT EXISTS events with A.timestamp < event.timestamp < C.timestamp AND event.activity NOT IN ('A','C')`). Fails to verify model anomaly (direct A-C path).
  - **Insights (Perfect: 10/10)**: Ties queries to verification/hypotheses; actionable (e.g., frequency thresholds, audits).

- **Weaknesses (Strict Deductions)**:
  - Query inaccuracies/duplication (~1.5-point deduction): Prevent "nearly flawless." Second loop query redundant; AC query invalidates "immediate" claim.
  - Minor unclarities: Loop table row formatting slightly broken (`|` mid-hypotheses); no adjusters table usage (prompt suggests possible, though not required).
  - No overreach/omissions: Uses correct schema (timestamps, activities); ignores non-anomalous paths.

- **Overall**: Near-elite (flawless structure/content, targeted queries cover 80%+ perfectly), but query errors are "significant" per strictness (not minor typos). 10 requires zero flaws; 8.2 reflects excellence minus precision gaps.
