**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. Both queries precisely meet the requirements: they correctly group by `case_id`, count events per case, filter to retain only cases with `COUNT(*) <= 6`, and return all original event columns (plus a harmless computed column in Option 1) for those cases. 

- **Correctness**: Both achieve identical functional results for filtering and returning the specified events. Window function (Option 1) and CTE+JOIN (Option 2) are standard, efficient in DuckDB, and handle arbitrary additional columns via `SELECT *` / `e.*`.
- **Option 1 details**: Window `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)` accurately computes per-case size without aggregation loss. The extra `case_size` column is a negligible augmentation (not altering event data; merely auxiliary for filtering) and does not violate "full set of events," as the prompt does not prohibit computed columns or mandate exact schema. Column references in `ORDER BY` resolve correctly post-subquery.
- **Option 2 details**: Perfect separation of concerns; produces *exactly* original event columns without extras.
- **Equivalence**: "Equivalent" accurately describes functional/relational equivalence for the task (same rows returned, differing only by one optional column); outputs are semantically identical for the prompt's intent.
- **Extras**: Unrequested `ORDER BY` is logical (by `case_id, timestamp` ensures case-coherence and temporal order) and enhances usability without side effects.
- **Clarity**: Labeled options with concise explanations; no ambiguities, errors, or inefficiencies.

No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities. Minor nit (extra column) warrants no deduction under the prompt's scope, as it does not impede the result. Single vs. dual queries is a strength (demonstrates versatility).
