**9.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (leading to high score):**
- **Structure and format (flawless, +2.0)**: Includes *all* required keys from the prompt exactly. Unary keys use `str: (float, float)` correctly. Binary keys use `tuple[str, str]: (float, float)` — correct for pm4py DECLARE (prompt's "as keys the activities" wording is clearly a generic/copy-paste error; standard lib uses pairs/tuples for binaries).
- **Values (flawless, +1.5)**: All `(1.0, 1.0)` as specified (support, confidence).
- **Python validity (flawless, +1.0)**: Clean, commented code; abbreviations match scenario; empty dicts properly handled.
- **Overall logical fit to scenario (strong, +2.5)**: Captures linear flow (successions), parallels (TFC/CE via coexistence/response/precedence), sequencing (e.g., DD  {TFC,CE}  PC enforced via response/precedence combo — sound, prevents wrong order even without exact counts), start (init/exactly_one IG), rough end (exactly_one FL), testing chain (PCLTUTAG successions + coexistence). Minimalist but representative; avoids overconstraining unspecified details (e.g., no order TFC vs. CE).
- **Empties justified (strong, +1.0)**: Comments explain "not used"/"no forbidden"; no bloat.
- **No criminal/off-policy issues**: N/A.

**Deductions (strict, totaling -0.8):**
- **Logical inconsistency in exactly_one (-0.4)**: Only IG/AG/FL get `exactly_one`, implying others *may* repeat — contradicts "series of steps" per product idea (linear/once each implied). Should include all (or most: DD/PC/LT/UT/MP) for full fidelity. Partial coverage weakens model (allows implausible loops/multiples).
- **Inaccurate comment (-0.2)**: "start and end are unique" lists AG (neither); unclarifies intent. Minor wording flaw, but hypercritical = deduct.
- **Minor incompleteness (-0.2)**: No symmetric entries (e.g., coexistence("CE","TFC")) or reverse pairs (e.g., precedence("DD","TFC") explicit, though response/precedence combo functionally covers). Redundant (coexistence LT/UT with succession), but not wrong. No `end: {"FL": (1.0,1.0)}` (absent from prompt list, but implied symmetric to init).

**Why not 10.0?** Not "nearly flawless" — exactly_one arbitrary/incomplete (core logical gap for "series"); comment inaccuracy.  
**Why not lower?** Model enforces process *semantics* correctly (ordering, existence, key relations); flaws minor/non-breaking. Equivalent to production-ready manual DECLARE for scenario.
