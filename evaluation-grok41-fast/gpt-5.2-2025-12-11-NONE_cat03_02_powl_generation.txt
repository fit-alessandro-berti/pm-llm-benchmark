10.0

The provided code is a nearly flawless representation of the described POWL model. It accurately captures all structural elements:

- **Correct node definitions**: All transitions use precise labels matching the scenario (e.g., "D&R" for Debug & Reconfigure). Operator nodes are properly constructed: `config_loop` as LOOP([BNC, DR]) faithfully models the repeating BNC  (exit | DR  loopback), and `deploy_xor` as XOR([CD, MD]) handles the exclusive choice without unnecessary silents.
- **Correct partial order**: The root `StrictPartialOrder` includes exactly the required top-level nodes. Edges precisely enforce the described dependencies:
  - SR  CS (prerequisite).
  - CS  DA, CS  ACI (parallel after CS; no edge between DA/ACI  concurrency).
  - DA  config_loop, ACI  config_loop (both prerequisites for loop).
  - config_loop  deploy_xor.
  - deploy_xor  QA, deploy_xor  SA (parallel after deploy; no edge between QA/SA  concurrency).
  - QA  GLA, SA  GLA (both prerequisites for GLA).
- **No extraneous elements**: No unused silents, no missing/incorrect edges, no violations of POWL semantics (e.g., PO correctly treats unconnected siblings as concurrent).
- **Code quality**: Imports exact, syntax valid, readable with comments aligning to scenario steps. Faithfully uses provided classes without deviations.

No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws detected, even under hypercritical scrutiny. This directly constructs the intended hierarchical POWL model.
