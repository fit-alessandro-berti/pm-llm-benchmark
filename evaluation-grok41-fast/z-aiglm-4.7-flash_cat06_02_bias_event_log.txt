**7.2**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Base Score):**
  - **Comprehensive Coverage:** Addresses all question elements: bias location (Scoring Engine/Manual Review), attributes/adjustments (+10 Community for "Highland Civic Darts Club", LocalResident proxy), fairness distortion (meritocracy undermined, double threshold), and implications (exclusion for non-affiliated, even with better raw scores; C005 as exception for high scores).
  - **Strong Evidence Use:** Key C004 (690  700 Approved) vs. C003 (715 Rejected) contrast highlights disparity effectively. Summary table crystallizes patterns. Objective tone, structured breakdown.
  - **Insightful Conclusions:** Correctly identifies social capital overriding financial merit; notes "castle wall" for average applicants. Self-corrects implicitly by handling C005 outlier.
  - **No Major Omissions:** Considers geographic proxy via LocalResident correlation.

- **Fatal Flaws Penalized Severely (Strict Deduction):**
  - **Factual Inaccuracy (Significant Penalty: -1.5):** "Every applicant in the club is marked as a 'Local Resident,' whereas all other cases are marked as 'None.'" This is wrong/misleading. "All other cases" (non-club) are **not** uniformly "marked as None" for LocalResident—C002 is LocalResident=TRUE with CommunityGroup="None." Grammatically ambiguous (seems to conflate columns), but distorts data pattern (club perfectly correlates with TRUE, but TRUE exists without club).
  - **Logical Flaw in Core Evidence (Significant Penalty: -1.0):** Prime example (C004 vs. C003) claims approval "solely due to the +10 adjustment" and "700 likely meets a minimum threshold." Ignores **confounding variable**: C004 LocalResident=TRUE, C003=FALSE. Cannot isolate club effect; comparison not controlled. Undermines claim of "clear penalty for lacking affiliation" without addressing resident status as potential independent bias. Assumed threshold (~700) unsupported—C003's 715 rejection suggests higher bar for non-locals or interplay.
  - **Unclarity/Overreach (Moderate Penalty: -0.3):** "Strong correlation" between club and LocalResident overstated (one-way: club  TRUE, but not vice-versa). Implications section repeats unnuanced C003/C004 contrast without qualifiers. Minor repetition (e.g., "distorted meritocracy").
  
- **Why Not Lower?** Main bias (+10 Community) correctly pinpointed with data-backed examples; structure flawless; implications directly answer query. Corrects for small sample via C005 nuance.
- **Why Not Higher?** Factual error + unaddressed confounder = not "nearly flawless." Per instructions, even minor issues (here compounded) warrant significant deduction; hypercritical lens demands controlled comparisons and precise data representation. Equivalent to a strong B-/A- academic paper with citation errors and causal overclaim.
