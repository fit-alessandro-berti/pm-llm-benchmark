This answer is exemplary: precise, comprehensive, and insightful. It accurately interprets every visual element (layout, lines, colors, stages), correctly explains mechanics (e.g., slope for duration, color coding), and delivers clear, data-driven insights (e.g., volumes, bursts, variability) without errors or omissions. No improvements needed.
