The provided SQL query is nearly flawless and fully satisfies the benchmark prompt with precision, efficiency, and correctness. It correctly uses window functions with deterministic ordering (via `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp, activity)`) to identify exact adjacent triples ('Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order') per case, computes the precise time difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events in that sequence (`next2_ts - next_ts > INTERVAL '5 days'`), collects matching `case_id`s via `DISTINCT`, and excludes all events from those cases in the final result using a clean anti-join pattern (`NOT IN`). The query handles edge cases implicitly (e.g., insufficient events yield NULL LEADS and filter out; multiple sequences per case are covered by `DISTINCT`). DuckDB syntax is accurate, including interval arithmetic. Ordering in the final result is appropriate and matches expectations. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, performance issues, or deviations from requirements.
