**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless: precisely identifies Group B as biased with zero factual errors (correct scores, adjustments, and examples like U003 vs. U002); manifests the bias clearly and logically via numbered structure with direct log evidence; implications are comprehensive, relevant, and logically derived (meritocracy, discrimination, compounding, transparency) without speculation overreach; conclusion reinforces without redundancy. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws detected under hypercritical review.
