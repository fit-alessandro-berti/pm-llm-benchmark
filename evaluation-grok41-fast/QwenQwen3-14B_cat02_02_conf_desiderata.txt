**3.5**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (partial credit):** 
  - Correctly identifies Case 2 as having two normative violations and provides accurate **explanations** in the body text (e.g., timestamps show Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize after rejection).
  - Case 3 normative compliance is correctly stated.
  - Desiderata for Case 3 are accurately identified (delays calculated correctly: ~49 hours for Credit Check, ~51 hours for Inform; explicit no Follow-up).
  - Case 1 implicitly compliant (via table/summary).
  - Interpretations are plausible and on-task.
  - Structure is clear with sections, bullets, and table.

- **Critical Flaws (severe deductions – utmost strictness applied):**
  - **Major factual inaccuracy in key violation statements (fatal for high score):** Normative Violation 1 header states "*Credit Check performed before Risk Assessment.*" – this is **exactly backwards**. Factually, Credit Check was *after* Risk Assessment (09:00 vs. 08:20). The body explanation corrects it, but headers/table are wrong/phrased as if stating what occurred (violation named incorrectly). Summary table repeats: "Credit Check before Risk Assessment" – perpetuates error, causing confusion/logical flaw. This misstates the core violation repeatedly in "final statements/conclusions."
  - **Overreach on Case 2 desiderata:** Attributes "Missing Follow-up Call" to Case 2. Event log has **no entry** for it (like Case 1), but **only Case 3** is explicitly noted "*(No Follow-up Call)*". Absence  explicit confirmation of violation; problem highlights it only for Case 3. Unjustified assumption introduces inaccuracy (desiderata are "recommended," but evidence is lacking for Case 2).
  - **Incomplete explicit coverage:** Case 1 normative/desiderata compliance not stated outright in sections (only table); task requires identifying "which cases" – implied but not comprehensive.
  - **Minor unclarities:** Table phrasing for Case 2 normative is ambiguous/run-on (" Credit Check before Risk Assessment<br> Finalize..."); no justification why Case 1 has "None" desiderata (e.g., timings good, but Follow-up unaddressed explicitly). No mention if Case 1/2 implicitly met Follow-up (logs silent).
  - **No perfect alignment:** Task demands "clarify... not severe, suboptimal"; answer does via context but not emphatically repeated. Suggestions are generic, not "in line with constraints" maximally.

- **Overall:** Core logic ~70% sound, but repeated inaccuracies in conclusions/headers/table (not "nearly flawless"), plus overreach/incompleteness = mid-low score. Penalized heavily per instructions (even "minor"  significant drop; these are not minor). Flawless would explicitly fix phrasing, limit desiderata to evidenced cases, cover all explicitly.
