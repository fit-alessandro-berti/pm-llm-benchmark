**9.0**

### Explanation of Grade
This answer is exceptionally strong: comprehensive, logically structured, accurately derives and applies rules from the normative description, analyzes every case individually with precise timestamps and sequences, references specific textual quotes for violations, resolves ambiguities reasonably (e.g., implying cancellation means insufficient inventory requiring direct branching, mandatory packaging as prerequisite), and correctly identifies violators (Cases 2, 3, 5) while clearing conformers (1, 4). Coverage of explicit violations (e.g., packaging before authorization, shipping after cancellation) is flawless, and the summary ties back effectively.

**Minor deductions (-1.0 total):**
- **Phrasing inaccuracy in Case 5 summary (hypercritical deduction of -0.5):** States ""Ship order" occurs *before* "Package items,"" which is logically flawed/unprecise. "Package items" does not occur at all (it's skipped), so "Ship order" cannot logically precede a non-event; this misstates "absence" as "before." The case analysis correctly calls it "skipped" and a "mandatory prerequisite," but the summary's wording introduces unclarity and a subtle logical error.
- **Slight over-interpretation without risk (-0.5):** In Case 3 Violation 1, assumes "Check inventory likely revealed insufficient stock" based on later cancellation—solid inference, but the description doesn't explicitly log inventory outcomes, so it's a minor assumptive stretch (though justified by "directly proceed" rule and conditional logic). No impact on verdict, but hypercritical for perfect fidelity.

No other inaccuracies, unclarities, omissions, or flaws; no missed violations (e.g., Case 2's Authorize after Package correctly caught via explicit rule; Case 5's skip correctly mandated via "only after packaged" and sequence). Nearly flawless under strict scrutiny.
