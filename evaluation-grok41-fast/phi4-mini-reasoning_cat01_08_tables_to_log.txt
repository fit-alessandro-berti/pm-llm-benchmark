**2.0**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Incompleteness (fatal flaw, -4.0 penalty)**: The table only includes events for order 1001 (7 rows) with a placeholder "**Other Orders and Events**". Ignores orders 1002-1005 entirely, despite explicit requirement to "Ensure that every event for every `order_id` is included" and "every event for every order_id". Order 1004 has data (Order Created + Items Picked) but is omitted. No events from all tables for all cases. This alone disqualifies as a "comprehensive event log".
- **Factual inaccuracies (severe, -2.0 penalty)**: Order 1001 "Order Created" wrongly listed as "2024-01-02T12:30Z | Bob Smith" (actual: "2024-01-01T09:00:00Z | Alice Brown" from Orders + Resources). This propagates logical flaws (e.g., picking events on Jan-02 after "creation" on Jan-02, but misordered relative to real data).
- **Chronological incorrectness (major flaw, -1.0 penalty)**: Notes claim "ordered globally by timestamp rather than per case instance" – violates process mining standards where traces are **per case** (sorted timestamps **within** each order_id). Example table for 1001 happens to be roughly chronological but undermined by wrong creation timestamp. No sorting shown for multi-delivery cases like 1002 (should have 4 delivery events: 2x Dispatched + 2x Arrived, sorted by timestamp within case).
- **Missing events/derivation errors (significant, -0.5 penalty)**: No per-item "Items Picked" for other orders (e.g., 1002: ITEM-003/ITEM-005; 1003: ITEM-002/ITEM-006; etc.). No "Order Dispatched"/"Arrived" for DLV-5002/5003 (1002), DLV-5004 (1003), DLV-5005 (1005). Invoices/payments not included beyond 1001 (e.g., 1002 has 2 invoices + 2 payments). Order 1004 picking omitted.
- **Resource/attributes underutilized (minor but noted, -0.2 penalty)**: Resources correct where shown (e.g., Gina Carter), but missing for deliveries (e.g., carrier_id  GlobalTransport), pickings in other orders, sales for other cases. No "Other Attributes" (e.g., item_id/quantity for picking, invoice_amount, payment_method, delivery_note).
- **Unclear/ambiguous output (minor, -0.1 penalty)**: Notes repeat flawed assumptions (e.g., global ordering). Table header lacks full columns (no "Other Attributes"). Placeholder rows make it unusable for process mining.
- **Positives (partial credit, +0.3 base)**: Correct format (Markdown table), right columns, some accurate events/resources/timestamps (e.g., 1001 picking/delivery/invoice), per-item picking approach (logical), documents assumptions.

**Total: 2.0**. Barely above minimum due to format/partial accuracy, but hypercritically flawed on core requirements (completeness, accuracy, chronology). Not "nearly flawless" – unusable as a real event log.
