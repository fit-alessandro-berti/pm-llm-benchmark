**3.2**

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Major factual inaccuracy (critical deduction: -4.0)**: The answer claims "a 720 in Group A is rejected," which is false. P001 explicitly has a 720 PreliminaryScore and is **Approved** in FinalDecision. This is a blatant misreading of the Group A table (P001 vs. P002's 710). It undermines the core example used to illustrate bias manifestation, rendering the "same numerical score... different outcomes" argument logically invalid and misleading.
- **Failure to explicitly identify which log exhibits bias (significant deduction: -1.5)**: The question demands "Identify **which log** exhibits bias." The answer never states "Group B's log" (or A's), vaguely implying it through comparison. This omits a direct, required element.
- **Incomplete analysis of attributes and systematic differences (moderate deduction: -0.8)**: Correctly notes CommunityGroup boosts (+10) only appear in Group B's log and LocalResident is TRUE only there, but conflates them ("benefits from both the local resident flag **and** the community boost") without evidence—U002 (TRUE resident, no group) gets **no boost**. Fails to discuss how LocalResident might proxy/enable boosts (all boosts in TRUE cases) or infer thresholds (e.g., ~715 cutoff: 710 rejected both; 695705 approved only via boost; no A equivalent). Ignores U003 as prime bias example (low score approved via adjustment).
- **Unclarities and logical flaws (minor but cumulative deduction: -0.5)**: Phrase "bias isn't in the raw scores... but in the extra adjustments... applied only to one group" is imprecise—adjustments are conditional on CommunityGroup (not group membership per se), and Group A has no qualifying cases (systematic absence?). "Uneven playing field where identical initial scores can yield opposite final decisions" is overstated/false due to the 720 error (both approve).
- **Strengths (partial credit: baseline ~5.0 before deductions)**: Correctly identifies ScoreAdjustment as key (+10 "Community Boost" exclusive to B), notes attribute distributions, and links to approval differences. Structure is readable.

**Overall**: Far from "nearly flawless"—core factual error, omission of explicit ID, and flawed logic prevent >5.0. Strict rubric demands perfection for high scores; this is partially insightful but critically unreliable.
