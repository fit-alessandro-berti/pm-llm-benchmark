**10.0**

The provided answer is exemplary and nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It precisely identifies all key anomalies across Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 with exact timestamp/activity references, contrasts them explicitly against the standard P2P flow (using Case 1001 as baseline), and provides rigorous, logically sound explanations grounded in business practices (e.g., segregation of duties, three-way match, financial risks, compliance/ERP constraints, maverick spend). No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws exist in the final conclusions: every claim is verifiable from the log, explanations are comprehensive yet concise, structure enhances readability (headings, bullets, summary table), and risks are categorized without overstatement or omission. It fully addresses the task without extraneous content.
