**9.8/10.0**

### Rationale:
- **Accuracy (10/10)**: The description faithfully matches the diagram's structure, labels, flows, object counts (e.g., 3M for Create Requisition, 5.7M for Approve Requisition, 8.5M? for PO Create Order—appears correct based on visual cues), timings (e.g., 600ms), colors (purple requisition, orange sales/PO), and branches (e.g., Process Return at 0.8M linking to returns flow).
- **Completeness (10/10)**: Covers all major sections (Requisition left, Sales middle, PO right, Vendor Invoice bottom-left, Returns middle-left), steps, arrows, Starts/Ends, interdependencies, and key metrics without omissions.
- **Clarity & Structure (9.5/10)**: Excellent organization with overview, per-section breakdowns, and summary. Minor nit: Slight ambiguity in Requisition flow (two "Send Order" mentions could specify branching more precisely), but doesn't detract meaningfully.
- **Detail & Insight (10/10)**: Includes process sequences, object volumes, delays, and high-level complexity—goes beyond basics to highlight interdependencies.

Near-perfect; only tiny polish needed for max score.
