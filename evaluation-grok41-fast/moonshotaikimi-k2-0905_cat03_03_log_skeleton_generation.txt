**4.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Structural Correctness (Minor Positive, but irrelevant to high score)**: The Python dictionary format is flawless—correct keys, sets of tuples for relational constraints, dict with sets for `'activ_freq'`. Comments are informative. This alone merits no more than baseline credit.
  
- **activ_freq (Partial, -1.5)**: 
  - RO `{1}` is logical (case initiator).
  - Most `{0,1}` plausible for optionality (e.g., stockout branches implied but not explicit).
  - **Fatal flaw**: IC/RP `{0,1,2}` entirely invented ("may be re-sent/re-tried"); scenario states "an invoice is generated" (singular) and "updated once" (singular). No retries mentioned. Unjustified speculation = inaccuracy.

- **equivalence (Weak, -1.5)**: 
  - (CA, RI) semi-plausible ("once confirmed, reserved"), but equivalence demands *exact same occurrences bidirectionally*; scenario implies CA  RI but not strictly vice versa or equal counts if skipped.
  - (PI, QC) reasonable ("inspected to ensure standards").
  - Too few pairs; ignores broader chain (e.g., no RO equivalence). Feels arbitrary, not comprehensive.

- **always_before / always_after (Strongest Part, +1.0 offset)**: 
  - Excellent linear chain enforcing sequence: RO-implied  CA  RI  PI  QC  PO  GSL  D  IC  RP.
  - Bidirectional coverage (before/after) correctly implies co-occurrence and order. Aligns tightly with scenario narrative.
  - Minor nit: Redundant with directly_follows in places; no handling of potential branches (e.g., no-stock skip).

- **never_together (Catastrophic Failure, -3.0)**: 
  - **Complete misunderstanding of definition**: "cannot co-exist inside the same case" means *mutually exclusive entirely*, not "not simultaneous" or "order violation."
  - Pairs like (RO, D), (RO, IC), (RO, RP), (CA, RP), (PI, IC), (PI, RP) are *absurd*—every plausible trace has RO early + D/IC/RP late. Comments reveal confusion ("cannot dispatch before receiving")—they meant "not concurrent/immediate," not co-existence ban.
  - Inverts reality: These *must* co-exist. Zero valid pairs; adds fictional incompatibilities. Destroys model validity.

- **directly_follows (Adequate but Incomplete, -1.0)**: 
  - Plausible immediacies (ROCA, RIPI, etc.) fit scenario flow.
  - Arbitrary omissions (e.g., no CARI despite "once confirmed, reserved"; no DIC). Not "immediate" in scenario text—assumed, not derived.

- **Overall Logical/Completeness Flaws (-1.0)**: 
  - Incomplete RO-first enforcement (e.g., no always_before (RO, everything); activ_freq allows skips breaking chain).
  - No handling of potential failures (e.g., no-stock: CA=1, RI=0? Breaks equivalence/after).
  - Scenario is *linear* ("must be processed through a series"); model allows excessive flexibility/zeros without justification.
  - Inventions (retries, wrong never_together) > derivations; not "representing the scenario."

**Why not lower?** Chain constraints are ~80% accurate, structure perfect. **Why not higher?** never_together alone warrants failure (core constraint butchered); inventions/unjustified assumptions compound. Nearly flawless requires *zero* errors— this has multiple majors.
