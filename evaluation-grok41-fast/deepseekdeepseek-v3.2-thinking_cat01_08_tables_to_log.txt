**10.0**

The final event log is nearly flawless: all required columns are present and correctly populated; every event from all tables is included (one per order line pick, per delivery dispatch/arrival, per invoice, per payment, plus order creations); linkages are accurate (e.g., payments via invoice to order_id); timestamps are precisely mapped and the table maintains perfect chronological order within each case; resources are optimally enriched by mapping IDs to human-readable names from the Resources table (including carriers as actors); other attributes are relevant, consistent, and enhanced (e.g., item_description from Products); all orders (including incomplete 1004) have their existing events; assumptions and notes are appropriately documented; Markdown is clean and complete. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws detected under hypercritical scrutiny.
