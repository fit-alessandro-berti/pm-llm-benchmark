**3.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Critical Fatal Errors (immediate severe deduction)**:
  - **Invalid activity labels**: `('QI', 'CC')` and `('PA', 'WS')`. No activities named 'CC' or 'PA' exist in the scenario (valid: SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS). This hallucinates non-existent activities, directly violating the task's explicit activity set. Equivalent to submitting broken code/data.
  - **Duplicate keys with inconsistent values**: `('PT', 'PK')` appears *three times* total (lines 4-5: (28800,54000)? Wait no, first CA-PT, then PT-PK (43200,9000), later PT-PK (12000,7500)). In a real Python dict, later overwrites earlier; listing duplicates shows sloppiness/inconsistency. Undermines entire profile validity.
  - **Logical flaw in pairs**: `('PA', 'WS')` comment claims "After-sales support after storage" (implying AS), but key uses wrong label ('PA') *and* reversed order (storage WS precedes AS). Even if typo, pair direction violates "eventually follow each other" (earlier  later).

- **Major Inaccuracies in Estimates (supply chain realism)**:
  - Times are unrealistically short for "global supply chain" with "supplier lead times, manufacturing complexity, distribution network." E.g.:
    | Pair | Provided Avg (human-readable) | Realistic Expectation |
    |------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
    | ('OP', 'RC') | 8h | Weeks (global procurement/shipping: ~7-30 days  600k-2.5M sec) |
    | ('SS', 'CA') | 12h | Days-weeks (selection  assembly spans procurement/QI) |
    | ('RC', 'PT') | 16h | Days (inspection/assembly/testing) |
    | Max across dict | ~24h | Distant pairs (e.g., SS-DT) should be weeks-months; all <2 days here.
  - STDs sometimes exceed AVGs (e.g., CA-PT: avg 8h, std 15h – impossible for non-negative times; implies ~68% negative probabilities). Violates statistical sanity.
  - Comments contradict realism: "global shipping" at 8h? Laughable for supply chain.

- **Incomplete Coverage (despite "representative subset")**:
  - Misses key activities/pairs: No QIlater (beyond bogus CC), RCQI (direct successor), SSRC/OPPT/etc., WSAS, full chain skips (e.g., SSDT, OPAS for "complexity by multiple steps").
  - Only ~11/45 possible sequential pairs (linear 10 activities  45 earlier-later); "subset" excuse weak given "ensuring complexity."

- **Minor but Cumulative Flaws (per strictness instruction)**:
  - Unclear/sloppy comments: E.g., SS-OP "lead time from order to receipt" (wrong pair); PT-PK "parallelizable but constrained" (ok but inconsistent values); arbitrary "proxy if latency observed."
  - No coverage of full sequence end-to-end (e.g., no SSAS).
  - Trailing note ("representative estimates... historical traces") is flavor text, not data; irrelevant/unneeded.
  - Dict syntactically valid Python (minor plus), but errors make it unusable.

**Why not lower?** Basic structure (dict of tuples), some correct direct/skip pairs (e.g., SS-OP, OP-RC, SS-CA), proportional STDs in places. **Why not higher?** Fatal invalidations + unrealism + inconsistencies = non-flawless (far from "nearly flawless" for 9-10). Equivalent to ~30% functional correctness.
