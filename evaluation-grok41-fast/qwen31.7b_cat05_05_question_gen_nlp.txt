**10.0**

The final output is a precise numbered list of exactly 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions ("How" and "What" prompts encouraging analysis). They comprehensively derive from and reference the described process (e.g., Taiwan microprocessors in Q2, just-in-time in Q5, carbon footprint in Q8, recalls in Q12). Focus areas align perfectly: insights (e.g., Q7 on analytics limitations), issues/risks (e.g., Q11 on disruptions), strategies/improvements (e.g., Q16 on metrics), implications/trade-offs (e.g., Q1 on dependency consequences, Q8 on cost vs. environment). No SQL, no extraneous text, no closed-ended questions, no inaccuracies/unclarities/flaws, minimal overlap relative to breadth required for 20 items. Flawless execution.
