**9.7**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score):**
  - **Precise Identification of Bias Location/Mechanism (Flawless):** Correctly pinpoints Step 3 (explicit rule-based "upward adjustment" for local address/club membership as algorithmic proxy) and Step 4 (implicit "halo effect" via underwriter "context" interpretation), with Step 5 as materialization. Directly quotes/echoes prompt details (e.g., "Highland Civic Darts Club," "long-standing residents," "not openly disclosed," "perceived [correlation] but not formally proven"). No extraneous steps blamed.
  - **Justifiability Discussion (Excellent Balance):** Fairly presents pro (business correlation to stability/loyalty, legality via non-protected status) vs. con (violates meritocracy, proxy discrimination, feedback loop), without strawmanning. Ties to prompt's "non-protected" nuance.
  - **Implications on Fairness/Equity (Comprehensive):** Addresses proxy for socioeconomic exclusion (e.g., dues/time barriers, newcomers), transparency failure, unproven correlations, two-tiered outcomes (e.g., identical financials yield different rates). Logical chain to systemic inequity.
  - **Structure/Clarity/Objectivity:** Logical sections, bolded emphasis, analytical tone. Concise yet thorough conclusion reinforces thesis.
  - **No Major Inaccuracies/Logical Flaws:** Sequence respected; inferences (e.g., club exclusion via dues/leisure) logically derive from prompt's "community-integrated" intent without fabrication.

- **Minor Deductions (Strict Hypercriticism, -0.3 Total):**
  - **Slight Overreach in Assumptions (-0.1):** Infers club "requires dues, leisure time" and historical exclusion of "marginalized groups" – reasonable from context (voluntary, correlates with demographics), but prompt doesn't explicitly state costs/exclusion, making it a minor extrapolation (not "proven" like prompt's correlations).
  - **Jurisdictional Assumption (-0.1):** Cites "ECOA in the US" – apt for lending bias but unprompted (prompt generic); risks irrelevance if non-US context.
  - **Terminology Edge (-0.1):** "Classist" is apt but mildly charged (vs. neutral "socioeconomic bias"); "flee (skip town)" interprets "harder to flee" implicitly but adds flavor not verbatim.
  
These are trivial (no contradictions/misreads), but per instructions, "even minor issues" deduct significantly from perfection. Still, overwhelmingly superior – surpasses "nearly flawless" threshold.
