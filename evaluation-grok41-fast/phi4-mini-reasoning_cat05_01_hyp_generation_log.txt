**2.0**

### Reasoning for Grade
- **Strengths (minor)**: Correctly identifies key anomaly types from data (skipped steps, out-of-order, incomplete prior steps), aligning with examples like case 1002 (credit check after shipment), 1003 (ship before validate/confirm), 1004 (payment early).
- **Critical Flaws (major deductions)**:
  - **No hypotheses on causes**: Prompt explicitly requires hypothesizing *why* anomalies occur (e.g., system errors, policy violations). Final answer omits this entirely—lists types but no explanations like "rushed processing due to priority orders" or "resource policy bypass."
  - **SQL queries fundamentally broken**:
    | Query | Issues |
    |-------|--------|
    | 1 | Does *opposite* of stated purpose (finds cases *with* credit check, not missing). Uses undefined `event_timestamp` (schema has `timestamp`). No `WHERE NOT EXISTS` for missing.
    | 2 | Syntax errors (e.g., undefined `skipped_skipped_validation`, malformed CTEs, invalid `LEFT JOIN`). Logic incomplete; doesn't check sequence post-credit check.
    | 3 | Syntax/logic errors (e.g., invalid `MAX(CASE...)`, `CROSS JOIN` misuse). Checks *credit after validate* (opposite of intent); ignores event_id ordering.
    | 4 | Syntax errors (undefined `icase_id`, malformed CTE). Flags *complete late steps* without checking priors (e.g., ignores missing credit/validate).
    - No queries use `resources` (e.g., wrong dept/role like Sales doing logistics) or `orders` meaningfully (e.g., high-value priority skipping checks). No window functions/CTEs for sequence validation despite data needing `ORDER BY timestamp/event_id`. No coverage of data-specific issues (e.g., payment before invoice, invoice before ship).
  - **Unclear/inaccurate**: Purposes mismatch queries; no execution-ready SQL. Generic conclusion adds no value.
- **Overall**: Incomplete (missing "why"), inaccurate (wrong logic), unexecutable (syntax errors). Not "nearly flawless"—basic functionality fails. Strict penalty for core failures.
