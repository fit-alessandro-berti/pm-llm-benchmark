**9.7**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (near-flawless elements)**: The final conclusions and overall analysis precisely identify the bias mechanism—the XOR branch enables selective execution of `D`, which checks for local/community affiliation and grants a "subtle score uplift" only to qualifying applicants, systematically favoring a non-legally protected group (e.g., known community members). It correctly ties this to post-scoring influence, proxy risks (e.g., zipcode/ethnicity correlations), fairness violations (unequal treatment), equity concerns (hidden positive discrimination), disparate impact, opacity in POWL, and regulatory/ethical risks (ECOA/Equality Act). Mitigation strategies and bottom-line takeaway are comprehensive, actionable, and directly responsive. Structure (tables, sections) enhances clarity without fluff.
  
- **Minor Deductions (strict penalties applied)**:
  - **Speculative overreach (0.2 deduction)**: Claims like "a 510% increase in approval probability" (typo for "5-10%"?) and "0.5% absolute increase... dozens of additional approvals" introduce ungrounded quantification without model evidence; while illustrative, this borders on inaccuracy in a formal analysis.
  - **Slight unclarity/logical imprecision (0.1 deduction)**: Assumes XOR routing is "hidden condition" based on "zipcode, ethnicity, religion" without noting POWL lacks explicit routing logic (runtime choice unspecified), potentially overstating determinism. "Boosts... protected group" phrasing briefly contradicts question's "non-legally protected" focus, though immediately contextualized as proxy.
  
- **No major flaws**: No factual errors (e.g., correctly interprets XOR post-C, uplift via D selection), no logical gaps, fully addresses implications. Only penalized for hyper-minor issues; otherwise exemplary.
