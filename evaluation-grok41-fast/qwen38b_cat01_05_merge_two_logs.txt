**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**:
  - **Accurate Matching/Merging**: Correctly merged semantically similar events within ~2s tolerance (Order Received/OrderReceived: 2s diff; Order Validated/OrderValidation: 1s; Item Shipped/Shipping: 2s), using Log A's event names and enriching with all Log B attributes. Correctly left Payment Processed/PaymentCheck separate (5s > tolerance, semantic nuance noted). Quality Check and Item Delivered properly standalone. Full coverage of all 5 Log A + 5 Log B events without duplication or omission.
  - **Chronological Order**: Perfectly sorted by displayed timestamps (global chrono using primary/Log A for merged, native for separates). Chooses Log A as primary explicitly, consistent with prompt ("primary timeline").
  - **Enrichment & Attributes**: All attributes integrated flawlessly (Log B's user_id/resource_id/notes added to merges; "-" for missing in Log A-only events). Table format clear/enhanced readability.
  - **Reasoning**: Comprehensive, structured documentation of diffs, matches/non-matches, semantic rationale (e.g., "different stages" for Payment), tolerance application, and conflict resolution. Covers naming variations, ordering choice.
  - **Final Output Structure**: Clean table + detailed sections match prompt ("produce a single... log" + "document your reasoning").

- **Minor Inaccuracies/Unclarities (Deductions, Strict Lens)**:
  - **Timestamp Tolerance**: Prompt specifies "less than 2 seconds" (strictly <2s). Merges use exactly 2s (first: 2s; Shipping: 2s), technically outside "<", though "e.g." softens it semantically. Hypercritical: inaccuracy in rule application (-0.3).
  - **Timestamps in Output**: Reasoning claims "Log B’s timestamp... included as a secondary reference" and "explicitly noted", but table shows **only** primary (Log A) timestamp—no secondary column/note per event. Prompt allows "select one or include both"; selection fine, but inconsistent claim creates unclarity (-0.3).
  - **Origin Indication**: Prompt requires "indicating its origin" for non-overlapping/separate events. Reasoning does this well; table implies via attributes ("-" = Log A-only; full attrs = Log B or merged). No explicit "Source: A/B/Merged" column/label in log—minor gap in integrated log itself (-0.2).
  
- **No Major Flaws**: No logical errors, missing events, wrong order, attribute loss, or over-merging. Ignores <think> verbosity/corrections as instructed. Nearly flawless execution; deductions only for picky strictness on edge cases/wording.
