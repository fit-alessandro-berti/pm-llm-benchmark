**9.2**

### Explanation of Grade (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (driving high score)**:
  - **Comprehensive merging and inclusion**: All 10 events accounted for correctly (4 merged rows + 2 standalone = 6 rows). Matches are semantically accurate (e.g., "Order Received"/"OrderReceived", "Item Shipped"/"Shipping"). Standalone events (Quality Check, Item Delivered) correctly identified and included with origin implied via N/A and column structure.
  - **Enriched attributes**: All data from both logs preserved (user_id, resource_id, notes from B; event types from A). Both timestamps shown explicitly—excellent for transparency.
  - **Format and presentation**: Table is clear, professional, and easy to parse. Chronological order perfect based on consistent rule (earlier timestamp for merged events; sole timestamp for standalone).
  - **Reasoning**: Concise final summary documents all matches/separations explicitly, with timestamp diffs noted. Payment match justified reasonably ("only candidate") despite stretch.
  - **Consistency**: Implicit primary timestamp rule (min of A/B for merged) applied flawlessly across rows, enabling proper sorting. Aligns with prompt's flexibility on "chosen primary timestamp" and Log A's "primary timeline" nuance.

- **Flaws/Deductions (strict penalties)**:
  - **Payment match (major inaccuracy, -0.5)**: 5s diff exceeds example tolerance ("less than 2 seconds"); names differ notably ("Processed" implies completion vs. "Check" as preliminary). Prompt stresses "confidently match" and "leave separate if not confident." Admission of "outside tolerance" but proceeding anyway is a logical flaw—should have treated as separate (two near-duplicate rows at ~10:02Z) or unmatched.
  - **Conflicts resolution undocumented (-0.2)**: Prompt requires documenting "how conflicts were resolved" (e.g., timestamp choice). Final reasoning omits this—no explanation of "Merged Timestamp" selection rule (earlier ts), despite consistent application. Table infers it, but text must spell out.
  - **Origin indication minor unclarity (-0.1)**: N/A works but not explicit (e.g., no "Source: Log B/A" column/field). Prompt: "indicating its origin."
  - **Borderline tolerances unaddressed (-0.0)**: 2s diffs (Order Received, Item Shipped) = example threshold but not flagged/discussed.

Nearly flawless execution (table/ordering/matching logic superior), but Payment overreach and missing resolution doc prevent 10.0. Equivalent to A- under strict academic rubric.
