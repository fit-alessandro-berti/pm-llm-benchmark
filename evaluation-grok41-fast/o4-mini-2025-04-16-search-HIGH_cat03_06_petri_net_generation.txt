**9.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (near-flawless aspects)**:
  - Code is syntactically perfect, imports correct, uses PM4Py APIs exactly as required (PetriNet, Marking, petri_utils.add_arc_from_to).
  - All required activities modeled as labeled transitions with exact matching labels (e.g., "Re-Document Submission", "In-depth Investigation").
  - Places logically named (e.g., p_post_* for post-activity states), all added correctly.
  - Main sequence perfectly captured: source  CR  DV  FC  CA  AP  P  N  CL  sink.
  - Initial/final markings correct (im[source]=1, fm[sink]=1).
  - DV-RDS loop correct: alternates DV  RDS via p_post_dv  RDS  p_post_cr  DV; allows 0+ iterations, no re-CR firing.
  - FC-II loop structurally sound: allows FC once + 0+ II via self-loop on p_post_fc; enables multiple II before CA.
  - No syntax errors, deadlocks, or unreachable final marking; sound accepting Petri net.
  - Clear structure, good comments on construction.

- **Deducted points (strict/minor-to-moderate flaws, per hypercritical criteria)**:
  - **Comment inaccuracy (-0.5)**: Loop 2 comment claims "II loops back to FC", but II loops to *after* FC (p_post_fc), not input of FC (p_post_dv). Imprecise/misleading, though net is semantically defensible. Minor unclarity.
  - **AP modeling (-0.3)**: Scenario explicitly states AP is conditional ("*must be* approved *if* the amount surpasses a certain threshold"), implying optional/skip path (e.g., p_post_ca  t_p directly for low amounts). Net forces always-AP (no XOR/split). Logical incompleteness, even if sequential list suggests linearity; strict reading requires branch.
  - **Asymmetric loops (-0.0, borderline pass)**: DV-RDS alternates activities; FC-II is FC + II*. Matches "multiple times" for II but not perfectly "between FC and II" (task phrasing suggests interplay). Defensible (investigation as post-FC extension), but slight logical tension vs. DV symmetry.
  - **No explicit "C" transition (0.0)**: Scenario starts "customer files an Insurance Claim (C)", but net begins at CR (source token = "new claim arriving"). Implicitly fine per task, no deduction.

Overall: Nearly flawless (complex net correct, executable, matches core flow/loops). Flaws are minor interpretive (comments/AP nuance) but warrant deduction under "even minor issues significantly lower" + "logical flaws". 10.0 requires zero issues.
