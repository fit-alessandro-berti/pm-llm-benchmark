**4.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Task 1 (Identification of Long Cases; ~30% weight)**: Partial credit. Correctly computes durations for 102, 104, and 105 (minor quibble on 105's exact 1h05m tail vs. stated 1h55m, leading to ~50m inflation). However, **critical factual error**: Case 101 duration is 2h15m (08:00 to 10:15), not 1h30m—direct misreading of log. Worse, **logical contradiction**: Calls 102/104/105 outliers but then states "Cases 101–104 are significantly shorter" (ignores 102/104's 24-25h spans vs. 101/103's <2h). No explicit average computed (e.g., mean ~20h skewed by outliers; medians highlight 101/103 as fast). Fails "significantly longer than average" precisely.
  
- **Task 2 (Root Causes; ~30% weight)**: Middling. Correctly flags escalations (102/105) and delays (e.g., 105's post-escalation gaps). Notes Case 104's no-escalation delay aptly. But **inaccurate attribution**: Overemphasizes 105's "multiple" investigations (only one post-escalation listed); vague on "3-hour investigation delay" in 104 (assign 09:30 to investigate 13:00 is 3.5h, resolve next day unexplained). Misses patterns like all multi-day cases (102/104/105) vs. same-day fast tracks; no quantification of waits (e.g., 105 escalation-to-investigate: ~28h gap).

- **Task 3 (Explanations/Recommendations; ~40% weight)**: Strongest area—clear links (e.g., escalations cause "dependencies/coordination delays") and actionable proposals (thresholds, monitoring, automation). But **unclarities/flaws**: Recommendations generic/not data-tied (e.g., no specifics like "reduce 105's 28h post-escalation wait"); assumes Level-2 overload without evidence; ignores non-escalated 104 delay as counterexample needing separate fix.

- **Overall**: Well-structured/tabular, but **core inaccuracies** (data errors, contradictions) undermine reliability—unacceptable for analytics task. Minor issues (no total hours normalization, unaddressed overnight "business hours" assumption) compound. Flawless would require perfect data fidelity, quantified averages/patterns, precise outlier grouping (102/104/105 vs. 101/103), and tighter cause links. Deducts heavily per instructions.
