**3.2**

### Critical Evaluation:
- **Major logical flaw in `always_before` (fatal, -4.0 deduction)**: All pairs are inverted per the explicit definition. `('RO', 'CA')` means "if RO occurs, CA must precede it," which contradicts the scenario (RO starts the process, CA follows). Correct would be `('CA', 'RO')` ("if CA, then RO previously"). This breaks the entire chain; comments acknowledge the intent ("RO must happen before CA") but code violates it. No credit for comments overriding definitions.
- **Major misuse of `never_together` (fatal, -2.0 deduction)**: Self-pairs like `('RO', 'RO')` are semantically invalid. Definition is for *two activities* that "cannot co-exist in the same case" (mutually exclusive distinct activities). Self-pairs nonsensically imply "A cannot co-exist with A" (i.e., freq=0 or ambiguous multiple-occurrence ban). Redundant with `activ_freq`; should be `set()` (no exclusions in scenario). Comments misuse it for freq enforcement.
- **Inaccuracies in `directly_follows` (-0.5)**: Partial chain only (skips `('D', 'IC')` despite scenario logic); qualifiers like "often"/"usually" undermine declarative "shall occur immediately after." Scenario implies strict sequence, but incomplete/mismatched with `always_before` chain.
- **Minor issues compounding deduction (-0.3)**: `always_after` and `equivalence` empty (plausible, no credit needed); `activ_freq` reasonable ({1} fits linear "must" process) but over-assumes RP always occurs ("once the customer pays" implies possible 0). No branches/loops captured (correct). All activities covered.
- **Syntax/structure (+1.0 partial credit)**: Valid Python dict/sets; keys match exactly; tuples hashable.

Overall: Captures sequence intent but core constraints are backwards/wrong, rendering model invalid for scenario. Not "nearly flawless"—significant flaws prevent >5.0.
