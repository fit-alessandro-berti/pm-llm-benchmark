**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless: it precisely identifies **Group B** as exhibiting bias through the explicit, affiliation-based +5 "Association Boost" mechanism, with zero inaccuracies in data interpretation (e.g., correct raw vs. adjusted scores, valid cross-group comparisons like P002/U002 vs. U003). Manifestation is dissected logically via numbered steps, a clear comparative table, and evidence from columns (ScoreAdjustment, ProfessionalAssociation). Implications for fairness/equity are comprehensive yet concise, covering procedural violations, systemic reinforcement of privilege, and legal risks without overreach. It explicitly rules out bias in Group A with justification (uniform raw-score application). Structure is exemplary (sections, bullets, table), language is unambiguous, and conclusions are sharp, evidence-driven, and directly responsive—no flaws, gaps, or ambiguities warrant deduction under hypercritical scrutiny.
