**10.0**

The final Log Skeleton dictionary is nearly flawless. It correctly infers a strict linear sequence (RO  CA  RI  PI  QC  PO  GSL  D  IC  RP) from the scenario's sequential description of mandatory steps per order. All keys are present with appropriate values:

- `'equivalence'`: Empty set, correct (no activities must co-occur identically beyond individual freq=1).
- `'always_before'`: Immediate precedence pairs (e.g., `('CA', 'RO')`), correctly enforcing the full order via chaining (skipping any step violates an immediate constraint).
- `'always_after'`: Immediate succession pairs, correctly enforcing forward order via chaining (omitting any step after a prior one violates).
- `'never_together'`: Empty, correct (all activities co-occur in every case).
- `'activ_freq'`: `{1}` for all 10 activities, correct ({1} enforces exactly once per case, matching "must be processed through a series").
- `'directly_follows'`: Immediate pairs, correct (enforces no interleaving/skips in linear flow).

No inaccuracies in pairs, sequence, or format (valid Python, tuples as strings, all activities covered). Constraints minimally but completely specify the process without redundancy or excess (transitive order enforced implicitly via chains, per declarative semantics). No logical flaws, ambiguities, or omissions.
