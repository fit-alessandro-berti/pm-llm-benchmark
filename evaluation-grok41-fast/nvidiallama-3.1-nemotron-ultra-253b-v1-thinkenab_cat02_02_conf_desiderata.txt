**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (basis for high base score)**:
  - Perfect structure: Directly addresses all 3 task parts with clear headings, bullet points, and concise explanations matching the query.
  - Normative analysis accurate for Cases 1 & 3 (no violations, correctly stated).
  - Case 2 normative: Correctly identifies *two* key violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection).
  - Desiderata spot-on: Correct identifications for Cases 1 & 3 (timings precisely calculated/evaluated; missing Follow-up Calls noted); appropriately dismisses Case 2 as "purely normative."
  - Justifications reasonable, on-topic, and tied to behaviors (e.g., system error, workload) without fabricating facts.
  - No unclarities, no logical flaws in stated points, no contradictions; language precise and professional.

- **Flaws (deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Major inaccuracy (significant deduction: -1.5 points)**: Case 2 has a *third* clear normative violation—**skipping "Inform Applicant" entirely** after Loan Decision (strictly required per sequence: "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed"; "skipping activities... not allowed"). Log shows direct jump to Finalize Documentation  Close Case. This is not mentioned, making reasons incomplete. Hypercritical view: Fails to fully "explain the reasons" for Case 2 violations.
  - **Minor unclarities (small deduction: -0.5 points)**: Desiderata timings for Case 3 use "48+ hours" (actual ~49h for Credit Check, ~51h for Inform)—slight rounding imprecision, though functionally correct. Case 2 desiderata dismissal fine but could note short timings (<24h) for completeness, though not required.

- **Overall**: Nearly flawless (90%+ coverage), but the missed violation prevents 9+ (not "nearly flawless"). 8.0 reflects excellence with targeted penalty for incompleteness under utmost strictness.
