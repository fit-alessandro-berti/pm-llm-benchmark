### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This submission provides three well-structured draft prompts as alternatives to the original benchmark prompt. It is highly effective overall, with clear improvements in formatting (titles, bolding, structured tasks/steps), varied emphases (concise, explanatory, logical), and a helpful summary of key elements and selection guidance. All drafts accurately capture the core requirements: table/columns, `case_id` grouping, exact filter (exclude >6 events/case, include 6), full event rows output, and DuckDB context. No logical flaws in the task definition—prompts avoid solution spoilers (e.g., no hints on CTEs/subqueries/windows) while ensuring testability.

#### Strengths (Supporting High Score)
- **Fidelity to Original**: Perfectly preserves semantics ("more than six" exclude  "six or fewer" include; full events returned). Key elements list is 100% accurate and comprehensive.
- **Clarity & Structure**: Titles, bullet points, bolding, and step breakdowns enhance readability without ambiguity. Variations cater to benchmark needs (quick test vs. educational).
- **Precision**: Explicitly calls out "all columns"/"all rows (all columns)", addressing potential vagueness in original's "full set of events".
- **No Overguidance**: Steps in Option 3 are "to consider," not prescriptive, preserving challenge.
- **Utility**: Ending advice on choosing drafts adds value for benchmark design.

#### Deductions (Strict/Hypercritical—Minor Issues Compound to -0.8)
- **Unnecessary/Redundant Phrasing (Option 2)**: "Ensure your query correctly uses DuckDB's SQL dialect for grouping and filtering." DuckDB is ANSI SQL-compliant; this implies non-standard quirks where none exist for this task (COUNT/GROUP BY/HAVING/JOIN are standard). Minor unclarity—could confuse novices into overthinking. (-0.3)
- **Slight Interpretive Addition (Option 2)**: "relatively short" introduces subjective flavor not in original. Harmless but deviates subtly from neutral tone. (-0.1)
- **Potential Over-Emphasis on Steps (Option 3)**: Lists exact logic (1-3), risking participants rote-memorizing structure over understanding (e.g., might encourage inefficient multi-step queries). "Mission" phrasing is motivational fluff, mildly unprofessional for technical benchmark. (-0.2)
- **Minor Inconsistency in Key Elements**: Lists "**Definition of `case_id`:** Groups events for a single process instance." but original says "Each `case_id` groups events that belong to a single process instance (or 'case')."—options vary slightly (e.g., Option 1: "uniquely identifies"; technically accurate but "uniquely" assumes no dupes, unstated). Negligible but hypercritically imprecise. (-0.1)
- **Completeness**: Provides *three* drafts vs. singular "draft a prompt," but framing as "a few ways" fits; still, no single "best" recommendation beyond vague choice advice. (-0.1)

Nearly flawless—award 10.0 requires zero nitpicks, zero extras. This excels but has tiny avoidable frictions precluding perfection. Ideal for benchmark use; Option 1 is strongest for strict testing.
