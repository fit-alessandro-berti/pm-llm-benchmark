**4.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Answer/Code Only):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correct imports, net creation, place/transition definitions, markings (im/fm perfect), loop modeling for RDS/II (arcs complete and logical, enabling multiple iterations back to DV/FC inputs), sequential tail (APPNCL flawless), descriptive names/comments, follows pm4py example style.
- **Critical Flaws (severe deductions)**:
  - **Missing essential output arcs**: No `petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_fc, fraud_check, net)` – firing FC consumes token at `doc_verification` but produces **nothing**, dead-ending the primary path (DVFC). Similarly, no `petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_ca, claim_assessment, net)` – firing CA dead-ends at `fraud_check`. Impossible to reach final marking via main sequence; net is fundamentally broken/non-accepting for core flow. (-4.0 minimum penalty for logical invalidity.)
  - **Incomplete process modeling**: No split/choice after CA for conditional AP ("if the amount surpasses a certain threshold" implies optional path, e.g., direct CAP). Always forces AP, misrepresenting scenario. (-1.0)
  - **Extraneous elements**: Auxiliary transitions (`RDS_Return`, `II_Return`) not in scenario activities (unnecessary verbosity; loops could use single transitions/places more elegantly). Shebang/docstring/print clutter code. (-0.5)
  - **Minor syntax/idioms**: `net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(...))` works but assigns set.add() return (object); verbose. Explanation repeats code unnecessarily.
- **Overall**: Structure ~80% correct, but fatal arc omissions make net unusable/non-accepting. Not "nearly flawless" – significant logical/functional errors warrant low score despite thoughtful design.
