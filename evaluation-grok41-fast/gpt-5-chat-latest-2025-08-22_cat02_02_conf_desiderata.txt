**8.0**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
This answer is strong in structure, clarity, and coverage—systematically addressing all three tasks with case-by-case analysis, bullet points, tables-like formatting, a summary, and even bonus suggestions. It correctly identifies core normative violations in Case 2 (Risk before Credit; Finalize after Reject) and desiderata issues in Case 3. Interpretations are plausible and on-topic. However, under utmost strictness, multiple inaccuracies, unclarities, and logical flaws prevent a near-perfect score (9+ requires near-flawlessness):

#### Major Flaws (Significantly Lowering Score):
1. **Missing "Inform Applicant" as Normative Violation in Case 2 (Critical Inaccuracy)**:
   - The rules explicitly state: "Following the loan decision, **the applicant must be informed of the outcome**" (strict sequence step, before branching). Case 2 log has **no "Inform Applicant" at all** after Decision (Rejected) at 09:30—directly jumps to Finalize Doc  Close.
   - Answer only vaguely nods to it ("Sequence problem: deviated") in normative section and explicitly mentions "missing altogether" *only in desiderata* (wrong category—desiderata are timings/follow-up, not core sequence).
   - Final Summary lists **only two violations**, omitting this third clear normative breach. This is a logical flaw and incomplete analysis of "strict rules" (Task 1), misreading the mandatory path for *both* approve/reject.

#### Minor but Significant Flaws (Further Deductions Per Strict Criteria):
2. **Inconsistent/Imprecise Desiderata Assessment for Case 1 (Logical Inconsistency)**:
   - Follow-up Call is "encouraged" (desideratum deviation if skipped). Log shows **no Follow-up for Case 1** (like Case 3).
   - Answer notes it's "not explicitly present" but concludes "**meets desiderata (no concerns)**"—contradicting Case 3, where identical missing Follow-up + delays = "**deviates**".
   - Task 2 requires identifying *all* cases failing desiderata and clarifying "suboptimal." Case 1 fails mildly (skipped encouraged step, even if timings perfect). "No concerns" is inaccurate/overly dismissive.

3. **Minor Unclarities/Overstatements**:
   - Case 2 desiderata: Dismisses as "not meaningful" due to normative issues (fair), but then evaluates Credit Check timing anyway ("fine")—unnecessary since invalid, and ignores that Risk Assessment timing exacerbates ordering violation.
   - Interpretations (Task 3): Good, but Case 2 suggests "misclassification" without noting missing Inform could justify "procedural misunderstanding" more directly.
   - Extra LTL/Declare offer: Helpful but off-task (unasked), slightly dilutes focus.
   - Timings precise except Case 2 Credit Check: Log is 08:00 App  09:00 Credit (1h, not "1 hour after application" exactly—08:20 Risk is 20min, but nitpick).

#### Strengths (Supporting 8.0 Floor):
- Excellent organization (sections mirror tasks, bold conclusions).
- All *other* violations spot-on (e.g., Case 2 ordering/Finalize; Case 3 delays).
- Distinguishes hard/soft clearly, as prompted.
- No factual errors in timestamps/sequences; suggestions align with "in line with constraints."

**Net: 8.0**—Very good (80%+ flawless), but core omission of a blatant normative violation + inconsistencies drop it from 9-10. Fix those, and it'd be 9.5+.
