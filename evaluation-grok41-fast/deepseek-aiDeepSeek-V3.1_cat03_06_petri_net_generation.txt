**2.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Fatal Structural Errors in Petri Net (major deduction: -4.0)**: Numerous invalid `place-to-place` arcs (e.g., `after_dv`  `docs_ok`/`docs_incomplete`; `after_fc`  `fc_ok`/`fc_doubt`; `docs_ok`  `before_fc`; `fc_ok`  `before_ca`; `after_ca`  `before_ap`; `after_ap`  `before_p`; `after_p`  `before_n`). `pm4py` forbids direct place-place arcs (only placetransition or transitionplace allowed). Code will raise exceptions on `add_arc_from_to`. Splits are modeled incorrectly as uncontrolled token duplication from decision places (not XOR gateways; no decision transitions), leading to deadlocks (e.g., token stuck in `after_dv` with no enabled transitions; loops unreachable).
- **Syntax/Execution Errors (major deduction: -1.5)**: `net.plates.add(before_n)` (typo: `plates`  `places`); `before_n` place created but not properly added. Code fails to execute fully.
- **Logical Flaws in Process Model (major deduction: -1.5)**: 
  - No conditional for **Approval (AP)**: Scenario specifies "if the amount surpasses a certain threshold" (optional branch/skip), but net forces linear CA  AP always. No low-amount path to P.
  - Unnecessary/extra **C** transition and `after_cr` place; scenario implies C triggers CR directly, bloating net without value.
  - Decision "gateways" mislabeled as "proper" in explanation; `docs_ok`/`docs_incomplete` etc. are unreachable dead places, not gateways. No multiple firing for loops ("multiple times" for II ok in theory, but unreachable).
  - Odd place naming (e.g., `before_dv` after CR unnecessary; inconsistent "before/after" pattern breaks post-DV).
- **Minor Incompletenesses/Unclarities (deduction: -1.0)**: Transition labels verbose ("Insurance_Claim") vs. scenario abbreviations (C/CR/etc.); no silent transitions for true splits. Explanation overclaims validity ("models the complete... with proper gateways"). No removal example as in prompt. Net unnamed places/transitions inconsistent.
  
Partial credit (+1.0 base): Correct imports, all required transitions created/labeled, main sequence outline (up to DV), loops conceptually identified, correct `im`/`fm`, `end` token for closure.

**Total: 2.0**. Non-functional code with core invalidates as "accepting Petri net." Flawless requires runnable, sound WF-net matching scenario exactly (no conditionals/loops broken, no invalids). This is a broken sketch.
