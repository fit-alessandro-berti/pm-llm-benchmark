**8.0**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**:
  - **Perfect structural compliance**: All 19 required keys are present exactly as specified. Single-activity keys ('existence', etc.) and two-activity keys use dicts with activity abbreviations as keys ('IG', 'DD', etc.) mapping to `[1.0, 1.0]` or `{}`. No syntax errors, extra keys, or wrong value types. Activities match scenario exactly.
  - **Reasonable scenario representation**: 
    - `existence` for all 10 activities: Accurate inference ("goes through a series of steps" implies mandatory).
    - `init['IG']`: Flawless (clear start).
    - `precedence` for 8 logical followers (DD, TFC, CE, PC, LT, UT, MP, FL): Covers core sequential dependencies well (e.g., post-DD for TFC/CE; post-AG inferred for PC/MP; chain for testing; MPFL).
    - Empties for others (`absence`, `exactly_one`, negative/alt/chain constraints): Correct; scenario lacks conflicts, alternatives, chains, or exact-sets.
  - Values consistently `[1.0, 1.0]`: Matches prompt example, assumes ideal model.

- **Flaws (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Rationale logical/notation flaw (major deduction -1.5)**: Arrows systematically reversed/non-standard. E.g., "`PC`  `AG`" implies PC precedes AG (wrong; scenario: AG approves design *before* PC built). Similarly "`DD`  `IG`" (IG first), "`LT`  `PC`" (PC before LT). Consistent but unclear/backward convention ("successor  predecessor"?). Misleads on flow; violates "no unclarities."
  - **Incomplete coverage (moderate deduction -0.5)**: No `precedence['AG']`, despite AG logically needing predecessor (post-DD/TFC/CE or post-UT per list order; "approves design" after early steps). All non-IG activities should arguably have entries for "strict workflow"; omission gaps model.
  - **Minor over-assumption (minor deduction -0.0)**: `existence` all=1.0 assumes no optional paths (scenario "complex, multi-department" hints parallels/failures possible), but defensible.

Nearly flawless dict/structure elevates to 8.0; rationale flow errors prevent 9+ (not "hyperaccurate"). Lower would ignore strong scenario fit.
