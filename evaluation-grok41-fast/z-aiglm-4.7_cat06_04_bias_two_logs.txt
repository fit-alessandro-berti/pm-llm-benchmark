**9.5**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Answer Only):
- **Accuracy (Perfect):** Correctly identifies bias favoring Group B (Unprotected) via explicit evidence in its log (e.g., "+10 Community Boost" absent in Group A). Key comparison (P002 at 710 Rejected vs. U003 at 695705 Approved) is precisely accurate and damning—even post-adjustment, Group A's higher final score (710) loses while Group B's lower adjusted score (705) wins, proving disparate treatment. Attributes (`LocalResident=TRUE` + `CommunityGroupNone`) correctly tied as triggers inaccessible to Group A (all FALSE/None), leading to systematic exclusion.
- **Clarity and Structure (Near-Perfect):** Concise sections, table for evidence, direct mapping to prompt elements (ScoreAdjustment, attributes, decision differences). No ambiguities in core claims.
- **Completeness (Perfect):** Fully addresses manifestation, influence of attributes, and systematic decision differences (e.g., lowered effective threshold for Group B).
- **Logical Flaws (None):** Ironclad reasoning; no contradictions. "Intrinsic merit" (prelim) vs. adjusted clearly distinguished.
- **Minor Deduction (-0.5):** Phrasing "Group B exhibits favorable bias" (per prompt's "which log") is defensible but slightly imprecise—bias is differential (systemic across logs), not inherent to one log alone; Group B's log merely *reveals* the favoritism. "Allocation bias" term is apt but non-standard (could specify "disparate impact" or "preferential adjustment bias" for precision). These are nitpicks but warrant strict penalty per instructions. Overall, exceptionally strong—flawless in substance.
