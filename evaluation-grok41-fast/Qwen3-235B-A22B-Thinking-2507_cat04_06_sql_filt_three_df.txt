The provided solution is flawless. It precisely implements the requirements using window functions (`LEAD`) to detect the exact consecutive sequence within each `case_id` (partitioned and ordered by `timestamp`), correctly computes the strict time difference `> INTERVAL '5 days'` between the second and third events, identifies distinct `case_id`s meeting both criteria via CTEs, and excludes all events from those cases in the final `SELECT *`. DuckDB syntax is accurate (interval literals, comparisons, `WINDOW` clause). Edge cases (e.g., sequences near case end yield `NULL` leads, failing filters safely; multiple sequences per case correctly excluded if any qualify) are handled implicitly and correctly. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws; assumes standard event log properties (non-null `case_id`, chronological timestamps) as per prompt. No unnecessary ordering/grouping added, as unspecified. Explanation reinforces correctness without errors.
