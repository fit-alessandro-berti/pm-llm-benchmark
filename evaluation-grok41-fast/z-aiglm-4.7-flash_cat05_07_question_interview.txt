**9.7**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**: 
  - Perfect adherence to prompt: All questions are targeted, open-ended (starting with "What," "How," "Can you," "Who"), and focus exclusively on conceptual deepening—no SQL, no implementation/code details.
  - Comprehensive coverage: Uncovers missing details (e.g., data verification, record-keeping), decision criteria (e.g., manager assignment weighting, discount logic), roles/responsibilities (e.g., who chases repairs, owns exceptions), timing/sequencing (e.g., marketing vs. activation, audits post-lease), exceptions (e.g., post-audit issues, custom clauses, discrepancies).
  - Logical structure by stages mirrors process flow, enhancing interview utility; includes general flow (feedback loops) tying to described communication themes.
  - Accuracy: 100% tied to process description without fabrication; probes gaps (e.g., repair funding implied but not explicit, IT remediation).
  - Clarity: Precise, professional phrasing; no ambiguities or leading biases beyond natural interview style (e.g., "You mentioned").

- **Minor Deductions (Strict Penalty for Perfection)**:
  - Stage 4 Q1: Introduces "vacancy duration" (not in process, which describes *new* onboarding activation/screening without prior vacancies) as a hypothetical in "fixed percentage or a variable based on...". Minor logical overreach/inaccuracy in example phrasing (-0.2); still valid probe for criteria but hypercritically flawed assumption.
  - Stage 4 Q1: "Mathematical... logic used to calculate" slightly edges toward formulaic specificity (process mentions "pricing models" but discounts are vague "consider offering"); conceptual but not purely qualitative (-0.1).
  - No other inaccuracies/unclarities/flaws; 13 questions balanced, not excessive.

Nearly flawless—award adjusted only for these tiny issues under utmost strictness.
