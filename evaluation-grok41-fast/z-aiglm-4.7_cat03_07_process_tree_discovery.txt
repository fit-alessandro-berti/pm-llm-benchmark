**10.0**

The final process tree structure is precisely correct, flawlessly captures all observed traces with perfect fitness, appropriate precision (abstracts repetition without permitting unobserved behaviors like VF without preceding RMI in the branch or misplaced activities), and maximal simplicity (minimal operators, no redundancy). The notation exactly matches the prompt's conventions (operators, tau, quoted labels with full activity names from the log table). Trace explanations confirm replayability without ambiguity or error. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws whatsoever.
