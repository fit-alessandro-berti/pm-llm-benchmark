**4.0**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Major logical flaw (fatal deduction: -4.0+ points):** The Payment transition (`p`) has **two input places** (`p_ca_done` and `p_approval_done`), making it an AND-join. This requires tokens in *both* places to fire, but the paths are mutually exclusive (XOR): 
  - Direct path: token in `p_ca_done` only  `P` disabled.
  - Approval path: fire `AP` moves token to `p_approval_done` (empty `p_ca_done`)  `P` still disabled.
  - Result: **deadlock**. No path reaches `P`, `N`, `CL`, or `fm` (`p_closure`). The net is *not accepting* (no reachable final marking from `im`). This breaks the core requirement.
- **Missing transition for "Insurance Claim (C)" (-1.0):** Scenario starts with bolded **Insurance Claim (C)** as the trigger/activity ("customer files an **Insurance Claim (C)**"). No `C` transition; process skips directly to `CR` from initial place. Initial place represents "new claim arriving," but lacks explicit modeling of `C`.
- **Incomplete sequence coverage (-0.5):** No explicit post-CR place feeding DV (has `p_cr_done`, but rushed); minor, but unclear states.
- **Modeling strengths (partial credit +2.0-3.0 base):** Loops for RDS (DV ) and II (FC ) correctly modeled with intermediate places (nondet choice via shared pre-place). Code syntax/imports/structure flawless. Places/transitions added correctly. `im`/`fm` correct. Explanation accurate *except* approval claim.
- **Minor issues (-0.5):** Transition labels use full names (e.g., "Claim Registration"); scenario uses abbreviations (e.g., "CR"), but acceptable per pm4py/example. No silent transitions for proper XOR-join/skip (common fix needed, but unaddressed).
- **Overall:** Thoughtful attempt (~70% structure/loops), but critical flow errors make it non-functional/inaccurate. Not "nearly flawless"  mid-low score. Equivalent to a broken implementation despite good intent.
