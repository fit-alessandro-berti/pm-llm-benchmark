**10.0**

The description is exceptionally accurate, comprehensive, and precise. It correctly identifies all lanes, tasks, gateways (with exact types and symbols), events (including the non-interrupting timer boundary event), data objects, flows, and logic—matching the diagram perfectly without omissions, errors, or extraneous details. BPMN terminology is used flawlessly (e.g., parallel/inclusive/exclusive gateways, non-interrupting behavior).
