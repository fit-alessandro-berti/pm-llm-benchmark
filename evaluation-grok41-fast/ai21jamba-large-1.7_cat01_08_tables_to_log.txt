**3.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Completeness (Major Failure, -4.0 penalty)**: The event log is grossly incomplete. Orders 1003, 1004, and 1005 are entirely absent despite explicit requirement to "ensure that every event for every `order_id` is included." Order 1004 has clear events (Order Created + Items Picked) that must be represented. For order 1002, the second payment (PAY-2003 for INV-1003, 2024-01-15T09:00:00Z) is missing. Only ~45% of expected events (~16/34) are present. This violates core tasks 1, 2, and 4.
- **Chronological Correctness (Major Failure, -1.5 penalty)**: Events within cases are not sorted by timestamp. For 1002: Second "Order Dispatched" (2024-01-05T07:00:00Z) appears *after* first "Order Arrived" (2024-01-07T16:10:00Z), breaking sequence. Prompt mandates "chronological order reflects the real process flow" and "maintain chronological correctness." No global sort by Case ID + Timestamp.
- **Output Format (Major Failure, -1.0 penalty)**: Not a single "structured table." Broken by arbitrary `|---------|` separator rows (invalid Markdown table syntax, renders poorly). Abruptly truncated after partial 1002. Extra "Next Steps" section and explanatory text violate "provide the final event log as a structured table... each row represents a single event." Should be one comprehensive table.
- **Accuracy and Logical Flaws (Moderate Issues, -0.5 penalty)**: Resource mappings mostly correct but inconsistent/abbreviated (e.g., "Global" vs. full "GlobalTransport"; "Alice" vs. "Alice Brown"). Payments use "N/A" (acceptable as optional) but miss linkage details. No documentation of assumptions (e.g., handling no-delivery for 1004; prompt requires this if "missing or ambiguous").
- **Strengths (Partial Credit, +1.0 baseline)**: Correct case ID usage; per-item picking, per-delivery dispatch/arrive, per-invoice events (good granularity); resources enriched where possible; timestamps accurate for included events; logical activity names.

**Overall**: Demonstrates partial understanding (structure, linking, granularity) but fails fundamentally on completeness, ordering, and format. Far from "nearly flawless"—unsuitable for process mining due to missing cases/events and invalid sequence. Strict deduction yields 3.0.
