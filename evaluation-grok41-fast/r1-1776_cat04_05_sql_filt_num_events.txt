The provided answer is nearly flawless. The final SQL query precisely solves the problem: it uses a subquery with `GROUP BY case_id` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to identify qualifying `case_id`s (those with six or fewer events), then filters the full `event_log` table via `IN` to return all events from those cases only, excluding any with more than six events. This correctly handles grouping, aggregation, and filtering as required.

The approach and explanation are concise, accurate, and directly reinforce the logic without extraneous details, ambiguities, or errors. Standard SQL fully compatible with DuckDB; no performance, edge-case, or syntax issues.
