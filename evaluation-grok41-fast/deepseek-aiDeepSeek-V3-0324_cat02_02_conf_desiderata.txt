**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
While the answer has strong structure (clear sections, tables, summaries), logical flow, and catches *some* normative violations accurately, it contains **critical inaccuracies, omissions, fabrications, and logical flaws** that undermine its reliability. These warrant a significantly reduced score under hypercritical standards—even partial correctness does not excuse major errors. Only near-flawlessness earns 9+.

#### **Fatal Flaws (Severe Deductions: -4.0+ points each)**
1. **Missed Normative Violation in Case 2 (Skipping "Inform Applicant")**:
   - Normative rules **mandate** "Inform Applicant" after Loan Decision, before Close Case (for both approved/rejected).
   - Case 2 log: Decision (09:30)  Finalize (10:00)  Close (10:30). **No Inform event exists at all**—a clear skip in the required sequence.
   - Answer's Case 2 sequence omits it entirely and does not flag it as a violation. This is a **major omission** of a strict rule (equivalent to skipping steps, explicitly "not allowed").
   - Case 2 actually has **3 normative violations** (Risk before Credit; no Inform; Finalize after reject). Answer only notes 2.

2. **Fabrication of Non-Existent Event in Case 2 Desiderata**:
   - Answer claims: "Applicant was informed **30 minutes** after rejection (within 48 hours)."
   - **No such event in log**. This is outright invention/false data, creating a misleading "no desiderata violations" conclusion. Since no Inform occurred, Case 2 **fails desiderata** (not informed "promptly" or at all). Logical absurdity.

#### **Major Flaws (Heavy Deductions: -1.0+ points each)**
3. **Incomplete Desiderata Analysis**:
   - Case 1: Correctly notes follow-up optional but claims "**No desiderata violations**" despite explicit "encouraged...before closing." Should clarify as "suboptimal" per task (minor inconsistency in wording).
   - Case 2: As above, wrongly deems timings "fine" via fabrication; ignores total failure to inform.
   - Case 3: Timings approximate ("~48h" for credit check: actually ~49h; "~51h" for inform: correct). Acceptable but imprecise; misses quantifying follow-up as a desiderata failure (task: "identify which cases fail").

4. **Part 3 Justifications Weak/Incomplete**:
   - Good for Case 2/3, but ignores missing Inform (no justification offered).
   - Adds unasked "Suggestions for Improvement" (extra, but dilutes focus; task is "interpretations or justifications...in line with constraints").
   - Case 1 ignored entirely (no need, but inconsistent coverage).

5. **Summary/Table Inaccuracies**:
   - Case 2: Desiderata marked "**No**"—wrong due to missing Inform.
   - Case 1: Desiderata "**No** (Follow-up...optional)"—hedges but still mislabels as "no" vs. "fails but not severe."
   - "Key Takeaways" downplays Case 2 as "most problematic" without noting the skipped Inform, understating severity.

#### **Strengths (Partial Credit: +2.0 base)**
- Excellent structure/readability (sequences, tables, bolding).
- Correctly IDs Case 2 order violation and Finalize-after-reject.
- Case 1/3 normative flawless.
- Distinguishes normative vs. desiderata well (when not erring).
- No new inventions beyond the one fabrication.

**Overall**: Starts at ~7.0 for structure/content, but fatal misses drop to 4.0. Not "nearly flawless"—core task (full violation ID) botched by omission/fabrication. Retrain-level errors.
