**10.0**

### Evaluation Summary
This answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It fully adheres to the prompt by delivering a comprehensive, targeted list of **open-ended questions** (all phrased with "What," "How," "Which," etc., to elicit elaboration without yes/no traps). Questions precisely map to the process description's stages (intake/docs  data capture  assignment  meeting  vendors/inspection  marketing  activation  screening  lease/move-in  audits/handoffs), while systematically uncovering **missing details** (e.g., document alternatives, pre-inspection checks), **decision criteria** (e.g., workload thresholds, screening trade-offs), **roles/responsibilities** (e.g., RACI, approvals), **timing/sequencing** (e.g., cycle times, handoffs, SLAs), and **exceptions** (e.g., escalations, withdrawals, special insurance). 

No inaccuracies (questions faithfully reflect/expand the description without fabricating elements). No unclarities (precise, jargon-free phrasing; logical category structure enhances usability without redundancy). No logical flaws (progressive flow from high-level to granular; no gaps in coverage; avoids prompting SQL/code/implementation by focusing on conceptual/process aspects, e.g., tool usage is framed for "visibility/traceability," not tech specs). 

Minor potential nitpicks (e.g., RACI acronym assumes familiarity but is standard/process-oriented; tooling questions are conceptual handoff clarifiers, not "details") are non-issues under the prompt's scope and do not detract. Exhaustive yet concise (~50 questions, no bloat). Warrants maximum score.
