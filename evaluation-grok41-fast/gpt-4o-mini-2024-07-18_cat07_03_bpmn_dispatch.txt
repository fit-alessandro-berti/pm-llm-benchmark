**9.8/10.0**

### Rationale:
- **Accuracy (10/10)**: The description precisely matches the flowchart's structure, sequence, decision diamonds (e.g., special handling, insurance, delay), actions (e.g., insure parcel, write label, obtain 3 offers, packaging within 48h, notify customer, paperwork, pickup), start ("Order details"), and end ("Shipment prepared"). No factual errors or hallucinations.
- **Completeness (9.5/10)**: Covers all major steps, branches, and notes (e.g., 48h timeframe) in a logical numbered breakdown. Acknowledges roles/columns (Warehouse, etc.) and decision points. Minor deduction for not explicitly naming every role label (partially obscured but implied) or minor arrows (e.g., exact parallel flows post-insurance).
- **Clarity & Structure (10/10)**: Well-organized, concise, readable summary with an effective overall assessment.
- **Why not 10.0?** Perfection would include a tiny sketch or verbatim quotes for every box (e.g., "Obtain offers from 3 logistics companies"), but this is already exceptionally thorough for a textual breakdown.
