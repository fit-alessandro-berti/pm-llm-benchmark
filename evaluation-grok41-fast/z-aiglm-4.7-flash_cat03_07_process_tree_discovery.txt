**1.0**

The final model fails to achieve fitness with the event log (fits Case 1 marginally but excludes Case 2 entirely—no path for AE  AD without mandatory RMI  VF—and mangles Case 3 by forcing VF after every RMI cycle and inserting extraneous AD mid-loop, yielding RMI  VF  AD  RMI  VF  AD instead of observed RMI  RMI  VF  AD). Loop semantics per definition mandate initial A execution (no 0-iteration path) and produce interleaved ADs on repetition (unobserved). Textual description inaccurately claims repetition of full "RMI  VF" (log shows consecutive RMIs sans intervening VF). Structure violates simplicity/precision balance by overgeneralizing invalid behaviors while underfitting log. Notation syntactically mimics binary nesting but semantically broken. No tau, concurrency, or choice to handle optional/skippable retries accurately. Fundamentally flawed discovery.
