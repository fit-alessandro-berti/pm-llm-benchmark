The provided answer is nearly flawless: it precisely identifies all normative violations (correctly spotting the missing "Inform Applicant" in Case 2 as a required step, alongside the order reversal and post-rejection finalization), distinguishes desiderata failures accurately (e.g., timings calculated correctly at ~49/51 hours for Case 3; properly notes Case 2's credit check timing as met despite normative issues, and treats follow-up as optional/missed recommendation without inflating it to a failure), clarifies desiderata as suboptimal/not severe, and offers plausible, rule-aligned interpretations (e.g., weekends for delays, oversight for skips). Structure matches the task exactly, with clear explanations, no ambiguities, and an enhancing (but non-contradictory) summary table/takeaway. Zero inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws under hypercritical review.
