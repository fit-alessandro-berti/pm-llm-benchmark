**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Correctness of core logic (strong, but not flawless)**: All three queries correctly identify cases with 6 events and return *those events only*. The subquery (1) and CTE+JOIN (2) are **perfect**: they use `SELECT *` to return full rows (all columns, as required for "full set of events" given "at least" those columns). The window function (3) is **logically flawed**—it explicitly selects only `case_id, activity, timestamp`, discarding any additional columns (e.g., if the table has `user_id` or others). This violates "full event rows." A correct window version would use `SELECT * EXCEPT (cnt)` (DuckDB-supported), but it doesn't. Claiming "all three will... Return the full event rows" is **inaccurate**, as they are not equivalent.
- **Completeness**: Prompt asks for **a** query (singular); providing three is helpful overkill but not penalized. All handle grouping/filtering precisely (`HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` or window equiv.). `ORDER BY` is unrequired but useful/consistent—minor plus.
- **Efficiency/Clarity**: All readable and efficient for DuckDB (standard SQL). Window scans once but adds unnecessary `cnt` column (dropped anyway). No performance flaws noted.
- **Strict deductions**:
  - Third query's column limitation: **major flaw** (-1.5); breaks generality for "at least" columns.
  - False "equivalent" + "full rows" claim: **inaccuracy** (-0.5).
  - No handling of edge cases (e.g., empty table, NULL `case_id`—but prompt doesn't require; assumed handled by SQL): neutral.
- **Why not higher?** Not "nearly flawless"—clear logical inaccuracy prevents 9+. Why not lower? Two flawless queries + accurate summary of intent carry weight (85%+ effective).
- **Perfect 10.0 would require**: Single (or multiple) fully correct queries with `SELECT *` everywhere, no misleading claims, exact match to "full set."
