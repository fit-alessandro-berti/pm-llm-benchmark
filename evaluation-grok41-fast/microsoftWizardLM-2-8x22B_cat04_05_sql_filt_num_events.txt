The provided answer is flawless. The SQL query precisely accomplishes the task using a CTE to compute event counts per `case_id`, followed by an INNER JOIN and `WHERE` filter on `event_count <= 6`, correctly returning all events (`e.*`) only from qualifying cases. It handles grouping accurately, preserves the full row data, and is valid DuckDB SQL. The step-by-step explanation is clear, accurate, and directly reinforces the query logic without extraneous details or errors. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, inefficiencies, or deviations from requirements exist—even under hypercritical scrutiny.
