**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (Supporting High Base Score):**
- **Anomaly Identification (Flawless, 10/10):** Precisely catalogs deviations per case (1002: premature logistics; 1003: skipped stock + late confirm; 1004: upfront payment + missing credit/stock). Accurately notes case 1001 as normal. Ties to risks (e.g., inventory/bad debt risks) and data (e.g., "priority", "late_confirmation=Y", "shipment_scheduled=N"). No misses or inventions.
- **Hypotheses (Near-Flawless, 9.5/10):** Comprehensive, data-driven (e.g., priority orders, additional_info flags), covers root causes (policy bypass, system flaws, fraud, silos). Balanced (legitimate exceptions vs. risks). Minor deduct: slightly speculative on "money laundering" without stronger data tie-in.
- **Structure/Clarity (Flawless, 10/10):** Well-organized sections, bullet points, purposes explained per query. Readable, professional.
- **SQL Overall (Strong but Flawed, 7.5/10):** 4/5 queries are executable, correct PostgreSQL syntax, leverage joins/CTEs/ROW_NUMBER appropriately, target hypotheses (e.g., Q1 inverts sequence perfectly; Q2 nails missings; Q3 handles mins/NULLs; Q5 simple/exact). Use `orders`/`resources` where relevant.

**Critical Flaws (Major Deductions, Preventing 9+):**
1. **Query 4 Incomplete/Unexecutable (Severe, -1.5):** Pseudocode with placeholder `/* insert logic from query 1 or 2 */`. Subquery is malformed (refers to non-existent "FROM /* insert logic */"). Cannot run as-is; requires manual fix. Undermines "propose relevant SQL queries" – this is a template, not a query. Logical flaw: doesn't specify *which* anomaly logic, risking inconsistency.
2. **Query 1 Duplication Risk (Minor but Strict, -0.3):** No `DISTINCT` or aggregation; cartesian-like pairs (e.g., multiple shipments/checks) duplicate case_id rows. Harmless for ID'ing but inefficient/unclean output.
3. **Query 4 Scope Vagueness (Minor, -0.2):** Even if fixed, "combine logic from above" is ambiguous (Q1 OR Q2? UNION?). Doesn't clearly investigate "resources/departments in anomalous sequences."
4. **Minor Omissions (Hypercritical, -0.3):** No query for resource-specific patterns (e.g., same LogisticsMgr rushing multiple cases) despite hypotheses. Doesn't probe `additional_info` (e.g., parse "credit_score<700" or "channel"). Hypotheses mention "high-value" but Q1 sorts by value (good), no threshold filter.

**Total Calculation:** Base 9.5 (excellent content) -1.5 (Q4 breakage) -0.8 (minor issues) = 8.2. Strong investigative response, but incompleteness prevents "nearly flawless." On larger data, it would surface issues effectively if Q4 fixed.
