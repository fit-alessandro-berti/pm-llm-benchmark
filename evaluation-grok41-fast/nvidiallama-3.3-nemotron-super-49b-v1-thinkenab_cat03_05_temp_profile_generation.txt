The final dictionary is a strong response: syntactically valid Python, uses correct tuple keys/values in seconds, provides a representative subset (9 pairs mixing 5 short/consecutive and 4 multi-step, spanning early/mid/late process with realistic supply-chain timescales from hours to ~12 days), demonstrates complexity via cumulative delays (e.g., SS-RC  SS-OP + OP-RC), and std devs plausibly scale with distance/variability (shorter pairs ~hours-days std, longer ~days-weeks). Estimates are sensible without relying on forbidden explicit numbers. Minor deductions for small numerical inconsistencies (QI-PK avg 207000s vs. implied ~216000s; SS-DT 1039200s vs. ~1030000s; inconsistent std dev approximation methods across pairs, e.g., sqrt-sum-vars for short chains but ad hoc/underestimated for long ones including high-var steps like WS-DT) prevent a perfect 10.0, but these are trivial estimation/rounding artifacts in an otherwise nearly flawless output.
