**10.0**

The provided SQL query is logically flawless, syntactically correct for DuckDB, and precisely matches the requirements: it identifies `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via a standard subquery with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then returns the full set of events (`SELECT *`) for exactly those cases. No extraneous clauses (e.g., unnecessary `ORDER BY`), no inefficiencies for the task, and it handles all edge cases (e.g., cases with 0-6 events included, >6 excluded). Minor phrasing slips in the explanation (e.g., "cases with 6 events" omitting "or fewer" in one spot) are contextual typos outweighed by accurate surrounding text and the impeccable query itself, which is the core deliverable.
