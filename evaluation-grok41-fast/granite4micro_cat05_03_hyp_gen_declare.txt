**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Anomalies (Major Failures, ~0/10):** Fundamentally misunderstands DECLARE semantics, undermining the entire section. 
  - Anomaly 1: Inverts precedence logic entirely—"precedence C after R" *enforces* R before C (correct behavior), yet claims it allows C without R. This is not an anomaly; it's proper enforcement aligned with intent. Fabricated conflict.
  - Anomaly 2: Misstates noncoexistence(E,C) violation. The true anomaly is it *forbids* both E and C in the same trace, despite process requiring both (sequential). Claims "intended process allows both...not enforced"—but rule *over-enforces* prohibition, not under-enforces. Unclear, illogical.
  - Anomaly 3: Gross misreading of responded_existence(A  E): This enforces "if A, then E must follow" (partial alignment with RAE). Claims it limits "assignment only once without preceding activities"—irrelevant, wrong (existence  "only once"; no precedence specified here). Misses real gaps (e.g., no RA, no full chain to C, ignores P/N entirely). No mention of init/existence strengths or undermined logic (e.g., allows paths skipping A/E/P/N if noncoexistence dodged).
  - Omits key contradictions: Model partially enforces start(R)/end(C)/AE/RC but *blocks* valid full traces via noncoexistence; allows invalid skips (e.g., RC directly).

- **Hypotheses (~5/10):** Generic, loosely matches prompt examples but untethered to specific anomalies (e.g., doesn't link misinterpretation to precedence/noncoexistence errors). Plausible but shallow, no insight into model (e.g., why noncoexistence? Data artifact from merged traces?).

- **Verification Approaches (~2/10):** SQLs logically flawed/mismatched to model/anomalies; don't verify stated issues or prompt examples effectively.
  - Query 1: Finds C without *E or R*, but model only requires R before C (not E); tests non-issue. Ignores timestamps for order; `NOT EXISTS` on same claim but no `timestamp <` check.
  - Query 2: *Fails to detect noncoexistence violation* (both E+C). Instead finds E/C without R/A—irrelevant to model rules. No aggregation for "both in trace"; selects raw events, not claims.
  - Query 3: Tests "E without prior A" (precedence AE), but model has *responded_existence* (A without E)—opposite violation. No timestamp order; ignores adjusters table entirely (prompt suggests checking assignments).
  - General: No queries for real issues (e.g., traces with A but no E; traces with E *and* C; C without R; full deviant paths). Inefficient/missing joins (e.g., `claim_events` self-joins without timestamps). No coverage of init/existence or adjuster links (e.g., specialization mismatch).

- **Overall Structure/Clarity (~6/10):** Well-formatted, independent presentation, covers 3 areas. But content inaccuracies render it unreliable/misleading. Minor: No `adjusters` usage despite schema/prompt; unneeded `claims` details in some SELECTs.

Cumulative: Core task failure on accuracy/logic  low score. Not "nearly flawless."
