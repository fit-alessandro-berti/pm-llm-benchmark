**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**:
  - **Comprehensiveness and Coverage**: The list systematically addresses **all** required areas (missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, exceptions) with clear sectional organization. Every major process stage from the description is targeted (e.g., docs in #1, assignment in #2, inspections/repairs in #3, marketing/activation in #4, screening in #5, audits in #6, exceptions explicitly in #7, communication in #8, timing in #9).
  - **Open-Ended and Targeted**: All questions start with interrogatives (What, How, Who, Are there) and probe conceptually (e.g., protocols, involvement, prioritization, resolutions). No closed yes/no, no SQL/tech implementation (e.g., #4's "integrated" is process-oriented, not code-level; #8's tools clarify usage, matching description's mention).
  - **Depth and Relevance**: Directly uncovers gaps (e.g., thresholds in #1, dependencies in #9, landlord involvement in #3/#7). Mirrors description's nuances (e.g., workload/expertise in #2, multiple applicants/negotiations in #5, custom clauses/pets in #7).
  - **Structure**: Logical sections with 1-2 questions each (total ~18, but concise "series"); intro/outro frames purpose perfectly without verbosity.
  - **No Major Inaccuracies/Flaws**: Questions faithfully derive from description; no fabrication or misinterpretation.

- **Minor Issues (Deductions for Strictness)**:
  - **Scope Creep in #10 (Feedback and Post-Onboarding; -0.5)**: First question ("feedback...into the process") is fine (landlord feedback fits onboarding). Second ("steps...after activated...tenant retention, maintenance") ventures into ongoing management/lifecycle, beyond the description's onboarding endpoint (lease finalization/move-in/audits). Prompt specifies "their property onboarding process" as described; this implies post-onboarding operations, diluting focus slightly.
  - **Redundancy/Minor Overlap (-0.2)**: #7 partially echoes description's examples (special insurance/custom clauses) without adding unique probe; #9's dependencies implicitly covered elsewhere (e.g., #3 repairs), though still valuable.
  - **Unclarity in Phrasing (-0.1)**: #6's "Who oversees the compliance officer and financial analyst roles during onboarding?" assumes an overseer exists (not stated in description), potentially leading off-topic if none; hypercritically, it's a leading probe despite open-endedness.

- **Why Not 10.0?** Per instructions, "even minor issues should result in a significantly lower score" – aggregated deductions prevent perfection, but excellence in 95%+ content yields high mark. "Nearly flawless" threshold met, but not absolute (no penalties for <think> as instructed). If ignoring #10 entirely, it would be 10.0.
