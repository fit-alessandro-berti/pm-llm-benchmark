**10.0**

This answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It fully meets all requirements: complete coverage of all events across all order_ids (including partial handling for 1004 with no invented data), precise chronological sorting within cases, correct data linkages (e.g., payments via invoices to orders, multiple per split cases like 1002), logical activity derivation (per-item picks, per-shipment dispatch/arrive, per-invoice/payment), accurate timestamps, enriched resources from Resources table (with reasonable payment_method fallback), and relevant other attributes (customer details, item desc/qty from Products, notes/amounts/refs). The Markdown table is properly structured and flat (bolding Case ID is a visual aid, not a data flaw). Assumptions are explicitly documented, including incompletes. Minor stylistic nitpicks (e.g., role abbreviations like "(Sales)", missing "(Carrier)" on carriers for consistency, one note slightly truncated on 1005 dispatch) are cosmetic and do not impact correctness, completeness, or usability for process mining—no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws.
