**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless. It correctly identifies all anomalies across Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 (while implicitly treating Case 1001 as normal), with precise sequence extractions tied to timestamps. Explanations are logically sound, directly linked to standard P2P controls (e.g., 3-way match, pre-approval sequencing), and articulate real-world risks (fraud, overpayment, audit failures, inventory issues) without speculation or overreach. Structure is exemplary: concise standard overview, per-case breakdowns with anomalous subsequences, bulleted problems, and a precise summary table. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical gaps; every claim is verifiable from the log and P2P best practices.
