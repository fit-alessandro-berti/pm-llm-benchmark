**2.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Major Logical Flaws (Fatal, -4.0 from max)**: The Petri net is fundamentally broken and cannot model the process correctly. Transitions like `fraud_check` and `document_verification` have multiple input places (e.g., `fraud_checked`/`investigated`  `fraud_check`; `claim_registered`/`documents_submitted`  `document_verification`), enforcing **AND-semantics** (requires tokens in *all* input places to fire). With single-token flow:
  - Main path stalls after `document_verification`  `documents_verified`: cannot fire `fraud_check` (missing token in `investigated`).
  - Loops are impossible: re-firing `document_verification` after RDS fails (missing token in `claim_registered`); same for FC/II.
  - No trace reaches `fm` (not even simplest CRDVFC...CL). Invalid accepting Petri net.
- **Syntax/Structural Errors (Fatal, -2.0)**: `petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(claim_closed, sink, net)` is **place-to-place arc** (invalid in Petri nets; arcs must be placetransition or transitionplace). Likely raises error or creates malformed net; token stuck in `claim_closed`.
- **Incompletenesses/Unclarities (-1.0)**: No modeling of AP conditional ("if surpasses threshold"—always sequential, no skip/XOR path). "Insurance Claim (C)" unmodeled (start assumes it, but unclear). Extraneous places (`documents_submitted`, `investigated`) add clutter without benefit; inconsistent end (why `claim_closed` before sink?).
- **Minor Positives (+0.0, no uplift)**: Correct imports, all activities/loops *attempted* with right labels/sequence skeleton, `im`/`fm` defined properly. Extra explanation/prints harmless but unrequested.
- **Overall**: Demonstrates superficial understanding (right activities/order) but zero functional correctness. Not "nearly flawless"—unusable net. Strict policy demands low score for such core inaccuracies.
