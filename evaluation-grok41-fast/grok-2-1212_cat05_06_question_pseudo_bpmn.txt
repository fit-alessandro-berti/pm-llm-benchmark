The response is flawless: exactly 20 questions, all open-ended (using "What," "How," etc.), directly tied to BPMN elements (e.g., specific tasks, gateways, flows), thoughtfully distributed across required topics (rationale: Q1-5,9,13,16-17; improvements: Q18,20; risk: Q4,10,19; decision-making: Q2-3,5,9,13,16; stakeholders/comms: Q14; performance: Q7,15), no SQL or extraneous content, crystal-clear phrasing, no inaccuracies/logical flaws/redundancies/unclarities. Hypercritical review finds zero issues.
