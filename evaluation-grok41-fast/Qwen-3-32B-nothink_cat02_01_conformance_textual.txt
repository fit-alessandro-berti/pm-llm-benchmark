**9.2**

### Justification for Grade
This is an excellent response overall—clear structure, accurate identification of all violating cases (2, 3, 5) and compliant ones (1, 4), strong alignment with the normative description, and precise references to constraints. The summary of constraints is comprehensive and faithful to the text. Case-by-case analysis is logical, with violations tied directly to rules (e.g., order dependencies like Auth before Package, no Ship after Cancel). Conclusion succinctly recaps without fluff.

**Hypercritical deductions (minor issues preventing 10.0):**
- **Minor inaccuracy/omission in Case 3 explanation**: Identifies two key violations (Cancel after Auth; Ship after Cancel) correctly, but misses the explicit rule ""Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping" (no Package occurs at all before Ship). This is a secondary violation (redundant to Ship-after-Cancel fatality), but completeness requires noting it, especially since it's highlighted for Case 5. Deduct 0.4.
- **Minor unclarity/logical phrasing in Case 2**: Stating ""Ship order" occurs after "Package items" (which is correct), but the prior step is wrong" is technically accurate but awkwardly phrased—risks implying Ship-Package order is isolated/OK, when the entire fulfillment sequence is malformed. Could be clearer (e.g., "violates required Auth  Package  Ship order"). Deduct 0.2.
- **Very minor formatting**: Sequences use inconsistent spacing (e.g., double spaces like "Receive order  Check"), slightly reducing readability vs. arrows or bullets. Negligible, but hypercritical. Deduct 0.2.

No major inaccuracies, wrong cases, logical flaws, or misinterpretations of ambiguities (e.g., correctly infers paths from sequences, resolves that Package is mandatory pre-Ship). Nearly flawless under strict scrutiny—high score reflects thoroughness exceeding basic requirements.
