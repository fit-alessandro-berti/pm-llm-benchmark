**2.0**

The final model is invalid as a process tree: it mangles notation (mixing | for hierarchy with invalid "LOOP (repeated twice)"), misuses + (parallel) on sequential RMIs/VF (log shows sequence, not concurrency), unrolls loop manually ("RMIs VF RMIs VF") instead of using proper * (A, B) for abstraction, uses non-leaf "RMIs" plural (leaves must be single activities like 'RMI'), fails to model XOR/skip path after AE (case 2 goes direct to AD, unrepresented), ignores tau/silent steps if needed for exit, and omits proper nesting/parent-child links per spec. No fitness (misses traces), poor precision (overgenerates), zero simplicity gain. Fundamentally not a ProcessTree.
