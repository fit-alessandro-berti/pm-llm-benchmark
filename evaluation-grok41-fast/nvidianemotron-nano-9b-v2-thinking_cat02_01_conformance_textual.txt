The final answer is flawless: it correctly identifies exactly the violating cases (2, 3, 5; Cases 1 and 4 are compliant and appropriately omitted), provides precise explanations tied directly to the normative description's rules and constraints (e.g., order dependencies, path branching, no ship after cancel, required steps like package before ship), handles Case 3's ambiguity/path inconsistency rigorously without contradiction, uses clear structure, and has no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. All interpretations align perfectly with the text.
