**7.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: The model is syntactically perfect (correct POWL classes, operators, edges; matches example style). Captures core sequential structure (ORMSQS...D), optional LB via XOR( LB,  ) perfectly (case 2), testing retry loop accurately for all cases (TST (RT TST)* ), and assembly as approximate loop for 4/5 cases. No concurrency misused (chain is appropriate, as log shows no true parallelism). Clear code, comments explain semantics well.
- **Major Flaw (-2.0+ deduction)**: **Does not fit case 3**. LOOP(AS, IQC) generates only AS (IQC AS)* —i.e., AS, AS IQC AS, AS IQC AS IQC AS, etc. **Cannot produce case 3's AS  IQC  IQC  AS  IQC  AS** (consecutive IQCs impossible, as IQC always forces AS next if looping). Explicitly claims "fits all five cases" —false statement, logical inaccuracy. Model rejects case 3 trace.
- **Minor Flaws/Unclarities (-1.0 total)**: Assembly loop comment "IQC AS IQC AS …" imprecise (actual: starts/ends with AS). No handling of case 3 anomaly (e.g., IQC self-loop or PO for IQC concurrency/repeat); oversimplifies "complex process." No silent transitions elsewhere if needed for skips (e.g., case 4 skips IQC via loop exit, ok but brittle).
- **Why not higher**: Not "nearly flawless" —core claim broken, one trace uncovered. Strict rubric demands perfection for 9+; this is good approximation (80% fit) but flawed representation of *the* log-provided process.

Nearly flawless would fully cover all variants (e.g., LOOP(IQC, AS) post-AS or nested XOR/PO for IQC repeats) without false claims.
