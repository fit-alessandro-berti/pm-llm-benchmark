**10.0**

This solution is flawless. It precisely uses window functions (`LEAD`) to detect the exact consecutive sequence via direct succession (no intervening events, as any gap would misalign `next_act`/`next2_act`), correctly filters on the >5-day delta between the specific events in the triplet (`next2_ts > next_ts + INTERVAL '5 days'` is exact for DuckDB and "more than 5 days"), collects `DISTINCT case_id`s for exclusion, and returns **all events** from non-matching cases. Handles edge cases implicitly (e.g., insufficient events yield NULL `LEAD`s, failing the activity match; multiple/overlapping sequences still flag correctly via `DISTINCT`). Syntax is DuckDB-valid, efficient, readable, and the explanation is accurate/concise. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws.
