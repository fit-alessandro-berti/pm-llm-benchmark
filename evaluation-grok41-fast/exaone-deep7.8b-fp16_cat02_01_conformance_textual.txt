The answer is nearly flawless: it correctly identifies exactly the violating cases (2, 3, and 5), with precise, structured explanations directly referencing and quoting the normative description. All violations are accurately mapped (e.g., order reversal in Case 2; branching logic contradiction and post-cancellation Ship in Case 3; mandatory Package omission in Case 5). Interpretations resolve ambiguities logically without overreach (e.g., inferring sufficient inventory from Authorize in Case 3). No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, omissions, or extraneous details; the summary reinforces without redundancy. Cases 1 and 4 are implicitly correct by exclusion, as required.
