**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless. It delivers exactly 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions ("How" and "What" starters throughout, no yes/no traps) directly derived from the described process, spanning R&D, sourcing (specific countries cited accurately), manufacturing (Malaysia details), transportation (air/sea trade-offs), distribution (regional variations), compliance, technology (ML, digital systems), sustainability, risks, after-sales, and improvements. All probe insights, issues, strategies, and implications without inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws. No SQL or extraneous content; the bolded titles enhance readability without violating "just list the questions," and the single closing sentence succinctly reinforces focus without adding analysis. Perfect adherence and quality.
