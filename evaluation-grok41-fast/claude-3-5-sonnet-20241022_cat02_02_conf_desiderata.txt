**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (supporting the score):**
  - Excellent structure mirroring the task's 3 parts, with clear headings and bullet points for readability.
  - Correctly identifies Case 1 as fully normative-compliant and a "golden path" example.
  - Correctly flags Case 2's two explicit normative violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection) and Case 3 as normative-compliant.
  - Accurately analyzes desiderata for timing in all cases (e.g., Case 1 prompt; Case 3 delayed; Case 2 timings ok where applicable).
  - Notes lack of Follow-up Call across cases and properly clarifies desiderata as "not mandatory"/"not severe"/"suboptimal."
  - Section 3 provides apt interpretations/justifications (e.g., workload for Case 3 delays; no excuse for Case 2) aligned with task.
  - Extra recommendations are logical extensions, not detracting.

- **Flaws (deducting points for strictness; these are significant, not minor):**
  - **Major inaccuracy/omission in Task 1 (normative violations):** Completely misses that Case 2 **skips "Inform Applicant" entirely** (required after Loan Decision per rules: "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed"; "no skipping steps"). Log shows Decision (09:30)  Finalize (10:00) directly—no Inform event exists (unlike Cases 1/3). This is a clear "skipping activities" violation, as explicit as the other two listed. Failing to identify/explain this makes the analysis incomplete for Case 2, undermining "explain the reasons" comprehensiveness.
  - **Logical flaw/unclarity in Task 2 (desiderata):** For Case 2, claims "Applicant informed promptly (assuming they were informed, though not explicitly shown)." This is speculative/wrong: the event log governs analysis; absence means not performed (normative violation above, but even for desiderata timing, cannot assume). Introduces uncertainty where strict log-based evaluation is required.
  - **Minor unclarities/logical gaps:** Desiderata for Case 2 lists "Credit Check done promptly" without noting its post-Risk timing irrelevance due to normative violation (minor, but hypercritical). No explicit statement that **only Case 2 violates normative** (phrased per-case, but implies it). Extra recommendations unasked-for (harmless but verbose).
  
- **Scoring Logic:** Base 9.0 for structure/content match and most accuracies  deduct 1.0 for missing key normative violation (core to Task 1)  deduct 0.5 for flawed assumption/logical error in Task 2  deduct 0.5 for incompleteness/unclarities. Result: 7.0 (strong but not "nearly flawless"—critical misses prevent 9+). Under hyper-strictness, flawless requires 100% violation identification, zero assumptions, no gaps.
