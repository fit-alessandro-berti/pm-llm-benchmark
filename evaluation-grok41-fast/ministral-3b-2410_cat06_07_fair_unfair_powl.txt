**2.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Major structural inaccuracies in POWL construction (fatal flaws, -4.0 deduction)**: Both models define a `loop` OperatorPOWL but **never include it in `root.nodes`**, rendering it dead/unused code. This fails to model the required loop for data completeness (explicitly mandated: "include loops", "loop process where the applicant is asked to provide additional details"). Instead, edges chain `DataCompletenessCheck -> RequestMoreInfo -> SkillAssessment` as a **linear sequence**, not a loop (*(A,B) semantics). This misrepresents the process entirely—no repetition possible.
- **Invalid edges and nodes (syntax/runtime errors, -2.0 deduction)**: All edges like `root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, DataCompletenessCheck)`, `root.order.add_edge(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)`, `root.order.add_edge(RequestMoreInfo, SkillAssessment)` reference nodes (`DataCompletenessCheck`, `RequestMoreInfo`) **not present in `root.nodes`**. Per POWL docs/example, nodes are fixed at constructor; adding edges to absent nodes will fail. Models are **non-executable/invalid POWL**, not "models" at all.
- **Incomplete process fidelity (-1.0 deduction)**: No modeling of skill threshold disqualification (proceed only "above threshold") or borderline filtering for `ManagerialReview`. Sequential flow assumes all proceed, ignoring description.
- **Partial correctness (minor credits, +1.0 total)**: XOR placement after `SkillAssessment` and removal in Model 2 correctly highlights/removes bias source. Labels match description. Sequential edges post-XOR (e.g., `xor -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision`) are logical. Explanation accurately describes intent.
- **Minor issues (-0.5 deduction)**: Repeated imports (verbose). `root.order.add_edge(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)` redundant/wrong even conceptually. No silent transitions despite example support.

**Overall**: Intent grasped (XOR bias), but models are broken/non-functional, fail core loop requirement, and don't reflect described process. Not "nearly flawless"—fundamental errors make it ~20% correct. 2.0 reflects partial understanding amid critical failures.
