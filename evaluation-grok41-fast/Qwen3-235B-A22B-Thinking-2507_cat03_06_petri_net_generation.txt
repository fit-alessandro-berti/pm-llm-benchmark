The provided solution is flawless. It precisely models the described process: linear sequence (CR  DV  FC  CA  (AP | skip)  P  N  CL), loops (DV  RDS, FC  II allowing multiples), conditional AP via choice at `p12` leading to unified `p4`, start at `p0`, end at `p7`. All pm4py constructs are used correctly (PetriNet, Marking, petri_utils.add_arc_from_to), code is executable, syntactically perfect, semantically accurate to Petri net rules (no invalid arcs, proper enabling/conflict for choices/loops, single token flow preserved), and matches the scenario verbatim without extraneous elements. Unlabeled routing transitions are logically necessary and compliant (prompt specifies labeling only "with the activity names"). No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or flaws.
