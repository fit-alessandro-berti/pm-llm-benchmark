**10.0**

The final output is exemplary and fully compliant with all requirements. It includes every available event across all order_ids (Case IDs), with precise mapping, chronological sorting within cases (verified timestamp order per case), logical activity names matching/inferring from the prompt's examples, accurate timestamps, appropriate resources (mapped correctly from Resources table where applicable, blank where not without forcing data), and relevant other attributes (concisely formatted, non-redundant, directly tied to events). The Markdown table is perfectly structured, complete (34 rows matching data counts: 5 creates + 9 picks + 5 dispatches + 5 arrives + 5 invoices + 5 payments), and readable. Assumptions are explicitly documented for missing data (e.g., order 1004), with no inventions or ambiguities. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws—even minor ones like inconsistent resource assignment or attribute overload are absent. This enables direct process mining use.
