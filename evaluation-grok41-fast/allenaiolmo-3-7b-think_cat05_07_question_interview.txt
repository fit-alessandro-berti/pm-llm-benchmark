**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Alignment to Prompt (Strength: Excellent)**: The questions precisely target missing details (e.g., Q1, Q4), decision criteria (Q2, Q6, Q13), roles/responsibilities (Q2, Q4, Q7, Q11), timing/sequencing (Q1, Q4, Q5, Q10), and exceptions (Q3, Q4, Q7, Q11). All are open-ended, conceptual, and process-focused. No SQL or overt implementation requests.
- **Comprehensiveness & Coverage (Strength: Near-Flawless)**: 15 questions systematically follow process flow, uncover gaps (e.g., bottlenecks Q10, scalability Q15), and add value (e.g., feedback Q12, training Q11). Logical organization by sections enhances usability without being required.
- **Clarity & Precision (Minor Flaw)**: All questions are targeted and professional. Explanatory notes in parentheses perfectly map to prompt goals, adding transparency without verbosity.
  - **Deduction Trigger**: Q7 phrasing—"how is the team evaluated and approved for exceptions?"—is logically unclear/awkward (seems to intend "how are exceptions evaluated/approved *by* the team?"). This creates minor ambiguity in an otherwise precise list (-0.5). Q14 note has trivial typo ("( addresses"  "*(Addresses") (-0.1). Q8/Q14 mention "tools" and "systems" (e.g., CRM), bordering implementation but remaining conceptual (as description references CRMs/tools; no penalty beyond strict scrutiny).
- **Structure & Polish (Strength: Exceptional)**: Numbered, sectioned list with summaries is superior to a plain list, directly usable. Closing summary reaffirms adherence.
- **No Major Flaws**: No inaccuracies, leading questions, off-topic items, or violations. Overly comprehensive (15 vs. ~10 ideal) but not penalized as "series" unspecified. Ignores <think> entirely.
- **Why Not 10.0?**: Single phrasing unclarity in Q7 prevents flawlessness under hypercritical lens. Why not lower? Fixes are trivial; 98%+ perfection in coverage/execution.
