**8.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (near-perfect elements)**:
  - Primary query (Option 1 subquery) is **flawless**: Correctly uses `GROUP BY` / `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` and `IN` to filter cases, then returns exact `SELECT *` rows without alteration. Matches task precisely (groups correctly, filters >6 events out, returns full events for <=6).
  - DuckDB-compatible (standard SQL).
  - Window function alternative is **functionally correct** and efficient.
  - Concise, well-formatted, with helpful extras like sorting suggestion.
  - Intro accurately restates goal ("six or fewer").

- **Deducted Points (Strict Critique - Inaccuracies/Flaws)**:
  - **Major inaccuracy in explanation (1.5-point deduction)**: Numbered list states "Keep only those `case_id`s whose total count **is 6**" (twice implied). This contradicts the task ("six or **fewer**", i.e., `<=6`), queries (`<= 6`), and intro. Misstates logic; could mislead readers into thinking exactly 6 events. Not minor—logical flaw in descriptive text.
  - **Schema alteration in alternative (0.5-point deduction)**: Window query outputs extra `case_cnt` column via `SELECT * FROM (SELECT *, COUNT(...) )`. Task demands "the **full set of events**" (implying original rows/schema unchanged). Subquery preserves it perfectly; this doesn't. Unaddressed in explanation.
  - **Minor unclarities (0.5-point deduction total)**:
    - Presents "a [singular] query" but gives two; alternative framed as equal despite flaws.
    - No note on potential ties/NULLs in `case_id` or duplicates, though task doesn't require (still, hypercritical expects edge-case awareness).
    - Sorting suggestion good but gratuitous/unrequested.

- **Overall**: Queries mostly ideal (9.5+ raw), but explanation inaccuracy + schema issue prevent "nearly flawless." Equivalent to correct code with buggy comments—strictly, 10.0 demands zero flaws. 8.0 reflects excellence with clear deductibles.
