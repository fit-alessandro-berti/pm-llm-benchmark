This solution is flawless. It precisely identifies consecutive events via row numbers, correctly filters for the exact sequence with the >5-day condition using DuckDB-compatible syntax (`INTERVAL 5 DAY`), excludes matching cases entirely as required, and returns all events from non-matching cases with sensible ordering. The explanation is accurate, concise, and directly maps to the query logic without extraneous details. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, logical flaws, edge-case oversights, or deviations from the prompt.
