**9.7**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Comprehensiveness (Perfect):** Fully addresses all specified goals—uncovers missing details (e.g., Q2 on verification steps, Q3 on prioritization metrics), decision criteria (e.g., Q4 on manager assignment factors, Q9 on tenant suitability), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q6 on decision-makers for exceptions), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q5 on milestones/bottlenecks, Q7 on repair timelines), and exceptions (e.g., Q6, Q7, Q8). No gaps in coverage of the process description; questions map directly to every major phase without redundancy.
- **Question Quality (Near-Flawless):** All 11 questions are targeted, open-ended (How/Could you explain/What happens if), conceptual, and phrased naturally for an interviewee. None request SQL, code, or technical implementation—stays purely process-oriented.
- **Structure and Readability (Excellent):** Markdown with bold categories and bullets enhances clarity; logical flow mirrors process sequence. Concise intro/outro without verbosity.
- **Minor Deductions (Strictly Applied):**
  - **-0.1 for borderline probe in Q10:** "specific tools or protocols" edges toward implementation details (process already names CRMs/tools), though still conceptual and tied to communication flow—not a violation but not 100% pure per "no implementation details."
  - **-0.1 for formatting quirk:** Numbered list (1-11) with each containing a single sub-bullet feels slightly inconsistent/redundant (could be flat bullets), minor readability hiccup under hypercriticism.
  - **-0.1 for outro sentence:** Unnecessary restatement of goals ("These questions aim to uncover..."); prompt requests only "a list," so any addition risks bloat, even if helpful.
- **No Major Flaws:** Zero inaccuracies, logical errors, closed-ended questions, or off-topic elements. Self-contained, professional, and directly responsive. Only flawless on regrade would require zero extras and flat list.
