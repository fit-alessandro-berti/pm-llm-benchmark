The response fully meets all criteria with flawless execution: precise grouping of all 15 events into logically distinct phases based on clear sensor pattern analysis; intuitive, manufacturing-relevant labels (directly aligning with prompt examples like "Cutting Metal," "Assembling Parts," "Welding," "Quality Inspection" while appropriately adding "Idle/Standby" and "Cooling/Pause" for completeness); detailed, evidence-based rationale tying specific sensor changes (e.g., temp spikes for welding, tool advancement for cutting) to activities without speculation or error; comprehensive table for labeled activities; explicit process flow deduction; no inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical gaps—all events accounted for, patterns accurately described (e.g., tool position progression 010/15200), rationales hyper-specific and non-contradictory. Structure enhances clarity without verbosity.
