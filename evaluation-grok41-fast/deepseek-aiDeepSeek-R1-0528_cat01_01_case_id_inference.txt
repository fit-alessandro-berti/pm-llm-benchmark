The final answer is flawless: it correctly identifies exactly three cases with precise event groupings (covering all 18 events without overlap or omission), accurate patient demographics as unique identifiers, logical clinical sequences verified by timestamps and attributes, and comprehensive inference logic that aligns perfectly with the data (e.g., departmental flows, resource sharing explained implicitly, ancillary services like Radiology/Lab correctly attributed). Summaries are concise yet complete, with no inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical flaws.
