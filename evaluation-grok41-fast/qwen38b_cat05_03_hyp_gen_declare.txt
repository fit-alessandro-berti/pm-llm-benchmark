**7.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies (8/10)**: Core contradiction (existence of `C` vs. noncoexistence of `E`/`C`) is precisely identified, correctly linking to intended flow violation. Unintended exclusion follows logically. `responded_existence` ambiguity is noted but overstated as an "anomaly"—it's not clearly contradictory or undermining (likely intends A  E response), diluting focus. Minor unclarity in phrasing "coexist simultaneously" (noncoexistence forbids presence in same trace, not necessarily simultaneity).
- **Hypotheses (10/10)**: Flawless—directly mirrors prompt examples (misinterpretation, incremental changes, data issues, speed pressure). Comprehensive, plausible, independent.
- **SQL Verification (5/10)**: Severe inaccuracies undermine:
  - Query 1: **Major flaw**. Purpose explicitly states "claims that are closed (`C`) but lack evaluation (`E`)", but query selects *all* claims without `E` (from `claims` table, no `C` check via `claim_events`). Fails prompt's key example ("claims closed without evaluation"). Ignores that closure is event-based, not inherent to claims.
  - Query 2: Correct for coexistence violation.
  - Query 3 & 4: Accurate for A/E sequencing, good complements.
  - Query 5: Logical but flawed—`resource` (VARCHAR)  `adjuster_id` (INTEGER); no CAST or name match (schema has `adjusters.name`). Assumes unstated mapping, risks false negatives.
  - No query verifies existence (`claims` without `C`), missing model check. Overkill extras don't fix core errors.
- **Overall Structure/Completeness (9/10)**: Well-organized, independent presentation, no hints leaked. Covers all tasks.
- **Strict Penalty**: SQL errors are not minor—directly contradict stated purposes/prompt instances, creating logical flaws/inaccuracies. No self-correction in final output. Deducted heavily per instructions; not "nearly flawless."
