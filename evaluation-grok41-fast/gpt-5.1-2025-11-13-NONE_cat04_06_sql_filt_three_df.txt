**8.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This is a strong solution with excellent structure, correct sequence detection via consecutive row numbers, proper case exclusion logic, and a clean anti-join final query. The explanation is concise and accurate. However, under utmost strictness, several issues prevent a near-perfect score:

#### Major Logical Flaw (-1.5 points):
- **Incorrect time elapsed calculation**: `date_diff('day', o2."timestamp", o3."timestamp")` computes *calendar days between dates*, ignoring time-of-day components. This does not accurately measure "time elapsed" (actual duration).
  - Example failure: Create Order at `2023-01-01 00:00:00`, Confirm Order at `2023-01-06 00:00:01`  date_diff = 5 (not >5, case *not excluded*), but actual elapsed 5 days +1s **>5 days** (should exclude).
  - Counter-example: Create at `2023-01-01 23:59:59`, Confirm at `2023-01-06 00:00:00`  date_diff = 5 (not >5), but elapsed <5 days (correctly not excluded, but symmetric cases fail).
  - Fix: `(o3."timestamp" - o2."timestamp") > INTERVAL '5' DAY` or `date_diff('millisecond', o2."timestamp", o3."timestamp") / 86400000.0 > 5`. This is a core inaccuracy in the timing condition.

#### Minor Issues (-0.5 points total):
- **Unnecessary/unstable ORDER BY in `ordered`**: Includes `activity` (arbitrary alphabetical tiebreaker) and `rowid` (implicit but undocumented in prompt schema; works in DuckDB but not portable/guaranteed for all tables/views). Ties should use `rowid` alone or a explicit PK for stability, or note assumption. Harmless but unclear/unintuitive.
- **Unused columns in `triples`** (`rn_approve`, `ts_create`, `ts_confirm`): Bloat, though negligible.
- **Case sensitivity**: `DATE_DIFF` (all caps) works (DuckDB is case-insensitive), but non-standard vs `date_diff`.
- **No handling for non-increasing timestamps**: Assumes `timestamp` orders correctly; if future-dated events, sequence breaks (edge case, but unaddressed).

#### Strengths (why not lower):
- Perfect direct succession via `rn +1/+2` self-joins.
- Correctly identifies/excludes *cases* with *at least one* bad sequence (matches "contains the sequence AND timing").
- Efficient, readable CTEs; final anti-join returns *all events* from good cases.
- Nice `ORDER BY` in output (beyond requirements).
- Handles ties reasonably.

Nearly flawless (9.5+) requires exact time diff + no edge assumptions. This is production-viable but logically imprecise on the key filter.
