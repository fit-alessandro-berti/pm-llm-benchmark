The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It accurately identifies all violating cases (2, 3, 5) and compliant ones (1, 4) with no omissions or errors in classification. Explanations precisely reference normative constraints (e.g., auth before package, ship only after package and never after cancel, cancel directly after check if insufficient) without introducing ambiguities or misinterpretations. Case 3's dual violations are correctly pinpointed without redundancy or oversight (e.g., no need to separately flag missing package, as ship-after-cancel subsumes it). Structure is exemplary (table + conclusion), logical flow impeccable, no unclarities, and interpretations resolve textual ambiguities conservatively yet faithfully (e.g., auth implies sufficient inventory path, barring later cancel). No inaccuracies, even minor; zero deductions warranted.
