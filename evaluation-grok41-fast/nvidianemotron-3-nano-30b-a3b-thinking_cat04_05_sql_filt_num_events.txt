The provided answer fails to address the question, which explicitly requires crafting and returning a DuckDB SQL query. Instead, it outputs an unrelated "Draft Prompt – Benchmark Query" structure (a meta-prompt with task description, requirements, and a buried "suggested solution"). This is a fundamental misunderstanding and off-task response. No SQL query is presented as the direct answer or conclusion; the correct logic is only incidentally included as an example within incorrect framing. Strict evaluation demands the core deliverable (the standalone SQL query) be provided correctly—everything else is extraneous and disqualifying. Minor positives (e.g., the embedded SQL is functionally accurate) do not mitigate the total mismatch.
