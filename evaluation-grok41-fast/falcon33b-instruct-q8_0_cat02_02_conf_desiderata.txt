**4.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Major Inaccuracies in Normative Violations (Task 1) [-3.5 points deduction from max]**:
  - Case 2 has **three clear normative violations**: (1) Risk Assessment before Credit Check (ordering violation, correctly identified but poorly phrased as "skips performing" when it was performed *after*, implying no performance at all); (2) **No "Inform Applicant" activity at all** (skips a mandatory step after Loan Decision – completely missed); (3) **Finalize Documentation after Rejection** (explicitly forbidden, with log comment noting it – completely missed). Answer only covers #1 partially, rendering it grossly incomplete. Case 1 compliance unmentioned (should explicitly note no violations for full coverage).
  - No explanations for Case 1 (perfect adherence) or confirmation Case 3 is normatively compliant despite delays.

- **Inaccuracies and Unclarities in Desiderata (Task 2) [-1.5 points]**:
  - Case 3 Credit Check timing: Falsely claims "4 days ... to Risk Assessment"; actual is ~49 hours from Application Received (Jan 12 09:00) to Credit Check (Jan 14 10:00), or ~50 hours to Risk Assessment – a factual error (miscalculation of dates: 12th to 14th is 2 calendar days).
  - Inform Applicant: Correctly flags as exceeding 48 hours (~51 hours from Decision Jan 14 12:00 to Jan 16 15:00), but no precise calc or comparison.
  - No Follow-up Call: Correct.
  - **Fails to clarify severity**: Task explicitly requires "Clarify that while these deviations are not severe, they represent suboptimal behavior." Answer labels them "violates" without distinction from normative, treating as equivalent severity.
  - No desiderata analysis for Case 1 (all compliant, e.g., Credit Check 30min post-app, Inform 2hr post-decision) or Case 2 (e.g., no Inform = not "prompt"; no Follow-up – though overshadowed by normative, still relevant for completeness).

- **Incomplete Justifications/Interpretations (Task 3) [-0.8 points]**:
  - Only addresses Case 3 desiderata with generic excuses (technical delays, resources, communication) – no tie-back to "in line with constraints" (e.g., no justification for *normative* violations like Case 2).
  - Suggestions are vague ("adherence ... strictly enforced", "workflow system") and not case-specific (e.g., no rectification for Case 2's skips/ordering like retracing steps).
  - Ignores possible justifications for violations (e.g., Case 2: system error logging out-of-order; data entry mistake on Finalize).

- **Structural/Minor Flaws [-0.5 points total]**:
  - Good structure, but headings don't perfectly mirror task (e.g., no explicit "Case 1: Compliant" section).
  - Unclear phrasing: "absence of a Credit Check before" ignores it *happened later*.
  - No holistic summary (e.g., Case 1 = ideal; Case 2 = severe; Case 3 = suboptimal only).

**Rationale for 4.2**: Partial credit for correctly flagging Case 2's main ordering issue, Case 3 desiderata items, and basic structure (~45% accurate coverage). However, missing 2/3 of Case 2's normative violations, factual timing error, lack of severity clarification, and incomplete justifications make it far from "nearly flawless" – major logical gaps and incompleteness warrant low-mid score under hypercritical standards. A flawless answer would exhaustively list *all* issues per case, with precise timestamps, explicit compliance statements, severity distinctions, and constraint-aligned justifications.
