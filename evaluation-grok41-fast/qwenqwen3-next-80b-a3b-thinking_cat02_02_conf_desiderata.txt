**6.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
The answer is well-structured, comprehensive, and directly addresses all three task elements (normative violations with explanations, desiderata failures with clarification of suboptimality, and justifications/suggestions). It uses clear sections, bullet points, precise timestamps, a summary table, and a takeaway—excellent presentation that aids readability. Correctly distinguishes normative (strict) from desiderata (soft), identifies Case 2 as the sole normative violator with accurate explanations for **two key issues** (Risk before Credit Check; Finalize after rejection), clears Case 1/3 normatively, pins desiderata issues solely on Case 3 with correct calculations, and provides reasonable/practical suggestions aligned with constraints.

**However, significant deductions for major inaccuracies and logical flaws (preventing >7.0):**
- **Critical factual error/misreading of event log (Case 2)**: The log **omits "Inform Applicant" entirely** after Loan Decision (09:30)—a **mandatory normative step** ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed"; "Skipping activities... not allowed"). This is a clear sequence skip violation, yet unmentioned in Part 1 (incomplete reasons/explanation) or anywhere. Instead, the answer **hallucinates "Inform Applicant at 10:00"** (actual: Finalize Documentation at 10:00), propagating to Part 2 (wrongly clears Case 2 desiderata timing: "30 minutes after... within 48 hours") and summary table. This fabricates log data, misses a violation, and undermines credibility.
- **Incomplete normative analysis (Case 2)**: Lists only 2 violations; omits skip (and arguably Decision validity post-reversed Risk/Credit). Not "nearly flawless."
- **Minor unclarity/logical inconsistency (desiderata)**: Lists "No Follow-up Call" as Case 3 desideratum "violation" in text/table bullet, but qualifies "(optional, not a violation)"—confusing, as desiderata explicitly deem failure "not a serious problem"/"not strict." All cases lack follow-up (only Case 3 notes it), but inconsistently applied.
- **Minor timing nit (Case 3)**: 14th 12:00 to 16th 15:00 is ~51 hours (correct >48h), but table lists ">48h" without "No Follow-up" strikethrough despite note—sloppy.

These are not ignorable (per "hypercritical... any inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws"; "minor issues... significantly lower"). Flawless would catch/miss nothing, no log misreads. Strong but not elite (6.0 reflects ~60-70% perfection, penalizing core errors heavily while crediting rest).
