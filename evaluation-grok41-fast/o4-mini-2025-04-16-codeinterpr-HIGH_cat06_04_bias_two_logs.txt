**9.2**

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**: 
  - Accurately summarizes all cases' scores, adjustments, and decisions without errors.
  - Correctly identifies the core bias mechanism: +10 "Community Boost" applied **only** to Group B (Unprotected) applicants who are LocalResident=TRUE **and** in "Highland Civic Darts Club," unavailable to Group A (Protected) due to LocalResident=FALSE and CommunityGroup=None.
  - Explains manifestation clearly: no adjustments in A, material impact in B (e.g., U003 flipped via boost).
  - Discusses systemic differences via LocalResident/CommunityGroup  ScoreAdjustment  final decisions, using "disparate treatment" (unequal rules) and "disparate impact" (categorical exclusion of protected group) – precise and relevant.
  - Logical structure (glance/summary, manifestation, systemic impact) is clear, concise, and directly addresses the question.
  - Insightful fair-system suggestion reinforces analysis without fluff.

- **Flaws/Deductions (strict penalties for minor issues)**:
  - **Does not explicitly identify "which log exhibits bias" (major omission, -0.5)**: Question demands "Identify **which log** exhibits bias." Answer implies Group B via "applied **only** in Group B" but never states "Group B's log exhibits bias" or equivalent. Hypercritical reading: this fails direct instruction, forcing inference.
  - **Unaddressed inconsistency in score-decision logic (-0.3)**: 710 consistently rejected (P002, U002), yet U003 approved at **705** (lower score). Answer presumes "695 below threshold  705 above" without noting/querying this anomaly, implying monotonic threshold that data contradicts. Possible explanations (e.g., club membership lowers effective threshold beyond +10, or non-score factors) unmentioned – creates logical gap in "how bias manifests," undermining "systematic differences."
  - **Minor overgeneralization (-0.0)**: Intro says boost "fundamentally changes one applicant’s outcome" (true for U003; U001's decision unchanged despite boost). Negligible but noted.
  
Nearly flawless analysis (precise data use, strong causal chain), but omissions/inconsistency dodge warrant deduction from 10.0. Equivalent to A- work: excellent but not surgically perfect.
