**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score):**
  - **Anomaly Identification (Flawless):** Precisely pinpoints all key deviations from the normal flow across cases 1002–1004 (skipping, out-of-sequence, inconsistencies), backed by specific evidence from timestamps, activities, and `additional_info`. Correctly ignores normal case 1001. Risks articulated clearly and relevantly.
  - **Hypotheses (Nearly Flawless):** Four hypotheses directly tied to data (e.g., `order_type='priority'`, pre-payment timing, training, system latency). Varied causes (policy, human error, technical) match prompt examples. Logical and investigative.
  - **SQL Queries (Strong, Minor Flaws):** All valid PostgreSQL syntax. Use appropriate joins/CTEs/window-free aggregation. Directly investigate hypotheses (e.g., Query 1 tests H1 perfectly; Query 2 nails retroactive checks; Query 3 catches sequence/data issues). Cover skipping, resources, order_type. Self-contained, no external hints.
  - **Structure/Clarity:** Perfect sections matching prompt. Concise, no verbosity in final output. Actionable and precise.

- **Minor Flaws (Deductions from 10.0):**
  - **Anomalies Section:** Slight mislabeling of Case 1002 sequence issue as "Resource/Role Mismatches" – resources (`LogisticsMgr_2`) align with expected Logistics dept/role for `Confirm Shipment`; it's purely sequence, not authorization mismatch (-0.3).
  - **Hypotheses Coverage:** No explicit hypothesis/query for `Issue Invoice` after `Receive Payment` (prominent in Case 1004 anomaly) – covered implicitly but not targeted (-0.2).
  - **Query 3:** `LEFT JOIN` + `WHERE log_ship.timestamp < log_confirm.timestamp OR LIKE` misses cases with *no* `Confirm Shipment` at all (both conditions false on NULLs), though it catches data examples (-0.1).
  - **Query 4:** Filters cases correctly but then counts *all* events/resources in those cases (`COUNT(*)` on full `e`), inflating non-skippers (e.g., SalesRep registration). Should filter `e.activity IN anomalous activities` (e.g., `'Ship Goods'`) for "involvement in skipping" precision (-0.2).

Nearly flawless overall (superior analysis, 100% relevant to schema/data/prompt). Deductions are nitpicks but strictly applied as "minor issues = significantly lower" from perfection; still elite quality.
