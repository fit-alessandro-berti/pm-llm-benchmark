**9.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (Justifying High Score)**:
  - **Accurate Identification of Violators**: Correctly flags Cases 2, 3, and 5 as violating; Cases 1 and 4 as compliant. No misses or false positives. Perfect match to normative logic.
  - **Explanations Reference Text Well**: Ties violations directly to description (e.g., "Authorize payment must occur before 'Package items'", "Ship order should never occur after cancellation", "Package items before Ship"). Handles interpretation of branches (sufficient vs. insufficient) and constraints flawlessly.
  - **Structure and Clarity**: Excellent use of summaries, tables, case-by-case breakdown, and key observations. Concise, logical, scannable. No ambiguities in overall analysis.
  - **Comprehensive Coverage**: Catches all key issues (sequence swaps, skips, post-cancel ship). Interprets ambiguities reasonably (e.g., Authorize before Cancel implies contradiction with insufficient inventory).
  - **No Major Logical Flaws**: All core reasoning aligns with text. No overlooked violations (e.g., Close always final; Check always after Receive and before others).

- **Deductions (Strict/Hypercritical – Minor Issues Compound to -1.0)**:
  - **Inaccuracy in Case 2 Violation #2 Wording** (-0.5): States ""Ship order" occurs ... without proper payment authorization first". This is imprecise/untrue—Authorize *does* precede Ship (just after Package). The issue is derivative of Violation #1 (Package before Auth); phrasing introduces logical confusion by implying no Auth before Ship. Minor but clear inaccuracy per "hypercritical" standard.
  - **Overinterpretation in Normative Summary** (-0.3): Adds ""immediately after"" for Check after Receive. Text says "next logical step" (sequential, not temporal immediacy). All cases comply sequentially anyway, but unsubstantiated addition risks misinterpretation; strict docking for non-textual insertion.
  - **Minor Structural Nit (Unnecessary Offer)** (-0.2): Ends with "Would you like any further clarification...?"—task is analysis only, not interactive. Superfluous, slightly dilutes focus.

Nearly flawless (flawless would be 10.0). Deductions are minor but "significantly lower" per instructions; still very high due to 95%+ perfection in substance.
