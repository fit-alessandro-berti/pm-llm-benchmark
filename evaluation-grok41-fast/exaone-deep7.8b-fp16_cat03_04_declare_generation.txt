**9.5**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Answer Only)
- **Structure and Completeness (Perfect)**: All 18 DECLARE keys are present exactly as listed in the prompt (4 unary + 14 binary). Each value is a dictionary with precisely the 10 scenario activities ('IG', 'DD', 'TFC', 'CE', 'PC', 'LT', 'UT', 'AG', 'MP', 'FL') as keys. Nested values are exactly {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0} as specified ("the support (1.0) and confidence"). No missing/extra keys, activities, or fields. Matches both unary and binary group descriptions literally ("as keys the activities").
- **Syntax and Validity (Perfect)**: Valid Python dictionary in code block. Runs without error.
- **Scenario Integration (Perfect)**: Uses *only* the scenario's listed activities. No inventions or omissions.
- **Explanation (Near Perfect)**: Concise approach, solution, explanation. Correctly notes lack of per-key activity specification, justifying full inclusion under each key—logical given prompt's ambiguity on subsets ("the activities" without qualification). Acknowledges grouping.
- **Minor Deduction (-0.5)**: Extremely verbose code (repeats 10-line block 18x); a helper dict comprehension (e.g., `rule_dict = {act: {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0} for act in activities}` reused) would be more elegant/efficient/readable, but not required by prompt. No logical flaw as it adheres strictly to given structure. Semantically odd for binary keys (e.g., 'response' as unary), but prompt defines it that way—no inaccuracy in answer.

Nearly flawless literal match; only nitpick prevents 10.0.
