**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (partial credit):** Correctly identifies Case 2's core normative violations (Risk before Credit, Finalize after reject, improper close). Accurately flags Case 3's desiderata issues in section 2 (Credit >24h, Inform >48h). Case 1 correctly cleared. Suggestions are reasonable and on-topic.
- **Major Inaccuracies/Flaws (severe deductions):**
  - **Misses critical normative violation in Case 2:** No "Inform Applicant" event at all (required strictly after *every* Loan Decision, before branching/closing). This is a clear "skipping activities" violation, equivalent in severity to the identified ones. Omitting it invalidates completeness.
  - **Summary table errors:** Lists Case 3's *desiderata* issues (Credit/Inform delays) under **Normative Violations** column, contradicting section 1 and misclassifying them as strict rules. Case 3 normative should be "None." Also wrongly says Case 2 has "None" desiderata (ignores missing Follow-up, though minor).
  - **Timestamp/log inaccuracies:** Misstates Case 3 timestamps repeatedly (e.g., Risk Assessment/Decision as "16:00" instead of 11:00/12:00; assumes unneeded "typo" for Inform). Credit delay calculated as "40h 30m" (actual ~49h from 01-12 09:00 to 01-14 10:00), but close enough—still sloppy.
- **Minor but Penalized Issues:**
  - Fails to explicitly address "No Follow-up Call" in Case 3 as a desiderata fail (logged explicitly; task emphasizes identifying all).
  - Doesn't clearly state desiderata are "not severe/suboptimal" in every reference (implied but not clarified per task).
  - Suggestions invoke wrong timestamps (e.g., Decision at "14 16:00") and unnecessary "typo" assumptions, introducing unneeded speculation instead of sticking to log.
  - No mention of Case 2's missing Inform in suggestions/fixes.
- **Overall:** Covers ~70% correctly but undermined by high-impact errors (missed skip, table misclassification, log misreads). Not "nearly flawless"—logical flaws and omissions prevent >5.0.
