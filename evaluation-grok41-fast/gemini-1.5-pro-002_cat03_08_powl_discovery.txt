**2.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation:
- **Major semantic inaccuracies in loop modeling (fatal flaws, -4.0 deduction)**: LOOP(A, B) semantics produce only traces like A, ABA, ABABA, etc. (always starts with A, ends with A, #A = #B + 1). No trace A B is possible. 
  - `loop_iqc_as = LOOP(IQC, AS)` cannot produce IQC AS (all cases with IQC: cases 1,2,3,5). Produces IQC or IQC AS IQC, mismatching logs.
  - `loop_rt_tst = LOOP(RT, TST)` cannot produce RT TST (cases 1,3,5). Produces RT or RT TST RT, wrong order and parity.
  - Cannot skip loops entirely: first child (IQC/RT) mandatory, blocking case 4 (AS  TST, no IQC) and cases without RT (2,4).
  - Case 3 consecutive IQCs (IQC IQC AS) impossible.
  - Result: **No trace fully generable** (e.g., case 1: AS IQC AS TST RT TST impossible; forces extra IQC/TST or wrong order/parity).

- **Logical flaws in partial order (-2.0 deduction)**: Chains AS  loop_iqc_as  TST  loop_rt_tst  PK force mandatory loops. No edges AS  TST or TST  PK. Explanation falsely claims "bypassing loops" via nonexistent direct edges—pure fabrication/misunderstanding.

- **Incomplete coverage of log variability (-1.0 deduction)**: Ignores IQC self-loops (case 3), AS-IQC interleaving complexity, case 4 shortcut. No concurrency modeled (correct, as log sequential, but unmentioned). Multiple AS/TST instances mishandled (lone AS/TST + internal don't align).

- **Minor code/structural issues (-0.5 deduction)**: Lone `AS` and `TST` in nodes redundant/misleading (overlaps internals). No silent transitions elsewhere needed. LB XOR correct (+minor credit).

- **Explanation flaws (-0.5 deduction)**: Misstates graph ("edges from AS/TST to both loops and after"—false); overclaims accuracy ("accurately captures... variability").

Partial credit for correct initial (ORMSQSAS), optional LB, final (PKDPD), activity list. But core process (80% of traces) uncaptured. Not "nearly flawless"—fundamentally broken. Equivalent to wrong algorithm.
