**10.0**

The provided solution is flawless. It precisely identifies cases with the required direct-succession sequence using `LEAD` window functions (ensuring no intervening events via exact offsets of 1 and 2), correctly applies the strict "> 5 days" timing condition on the specific sequence's timestamps via interval arithmetic (`next_timestamp2 > next_timestamp1 + INTERVAL '5 days'`), collects distinct `case_id`s for exclusion (handling multiple sequences per case correctly by excluding if *any* qualifying sequence exists), and returns *all events* (`SELECT *`) from non-excluded cases only. DuckDB syntax is fully compatible (including `LEAD`, partitioning/ordering, `INTERVAL`, and `NOT IN`). The added `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` provides "proper ordering" (chronological per case, as implied for event logs). No inaccuracies, inefficiencies, edge cases overlooked (e.g., NULL `LEAD` values auto-filtered, empty exclusions handled), ambiguities, or extraneous elements. Explanation reinforces correctness without errors.
