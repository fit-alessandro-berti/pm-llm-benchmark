The provided answer is flawless. It delivers precisely 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions (all phrased as "How...", "What...", or "In what ways..."), directly derived from and faithfully aligned with every key element of the described supply chain process (e.g., R&D, suppliers, assembly, transportation modes, logistics, forecasting/JIT, distribution, quality/recalls, analytics/ML, currencies/time zones/regulations, sustainability, after-sales, KPIs). No SQL queries, no extraneous text, introductions, or conclusions—just a clean numbered list. Every question targets insights, issues, improvement strategies, or decision implications without repetition, inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. No extrapolations beyond reasonable inference from the description (e.g., Q11's cultural/language barriers logically stem from "multinational" and "time zones"; Q16's training from planners' roles). Perfect compliance.
