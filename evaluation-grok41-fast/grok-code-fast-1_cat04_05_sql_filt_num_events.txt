**10.0**

The provided SQL query is correct, efficient, and precisely matches the requirements: it uses a CTE to identify `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via proper `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then filters the full `event_log` to return all events only for those cases. The explanation accurately describes the logic without errors, ambiguities, or extraneous details. No inaccuracies, logical flaws, or inefficiencies detected.
