The solution is flawless. It precisely identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence using `LEAD` offsets (guaranteeing no intervening events via time-ordered partitioning), correctly filters for >5 days between the specific 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' timestamps in that triple (`next2_ts - next_ts > INTERVAL '5 days'`), collects those `case_id`s distinctly, and excludes *all events* from only those cases while returning everything else ordered logically. Handles edge cases implicitly (e.g., insufficient subsequent events yield NULLs, skipping matches). DuckDB syntax is correct (quoting, INTERVAL). Explanation is precise and reinforces logic without extraneous content. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws.
