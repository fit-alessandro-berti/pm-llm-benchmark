**10.0**

The answer is a comprehensive, accurate, and logically flawless analysis of all cases, correctly identifying Case 1001 as standard while pinpointing precise anomalies in Cases 1002 (PO and payment before PR approval; approval, goods receipt, and matching post-payment), 1003 (payment, invoice receipt, goods receipt, and matching all post-payment), and 1004 (goods receipt before PO issuance). Explanations align perfectly with P2P best practices, emphasizing risks like fraud, unauthorized expenditures, and control bypasses without any inaccuracies, omissions, ambiguities, or overstatements. Structure is clear (per-case breakdown + summary), and conclusions are precise and actionable. No penalties apply as it is exemplary.
