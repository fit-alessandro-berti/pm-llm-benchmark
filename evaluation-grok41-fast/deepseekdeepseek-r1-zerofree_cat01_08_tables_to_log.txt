**10.0**

The final output (the boxed Markdown table) is nearly flawless. It fully meets all requirements: uses `order_id` as Case ID; derives logical, descriptive activity names matching/exceeding prompt examples (e.g., per-item "Item Picked", per-delivery "Order Dispatched"/"Order Arrived", etc.); assigns correct timestamps from source tables; includes Resource/Actor where available (correct IDs from tables, blank otherwise); enriches with relevant Other Attributes (item_id, delivery_id, invoice_id, payment_id, payment_method); covers **every event** across **all** orders (1001-1005, including incomplete 1004); links payments correctly via invoice_id to order_id; maintains strict chronological order within each case (and overall by case+time); outputs as one comprehensive Markdown table. No data errors, omissions, duplicates, or anachronisms. Granularity (per-item/delivery/invoice/payment) is meaningful for process mining. No violations of instructions; optional tables ignored appropriately. Hypercritical review finds zero inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws.
