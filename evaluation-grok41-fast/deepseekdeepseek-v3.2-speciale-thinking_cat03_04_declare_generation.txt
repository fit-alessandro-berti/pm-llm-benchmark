**10.0**

The final output is a complete, syntactically valid Python dictionary that precisely matches the required structure and keys from the prompt. It uses tuples for binary constraint keys (standard for pm4py DECLARE models), and maps each to a dictionary `{'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}`, faithfully interpreting the prompt's description of "the support (1.0) and confidence". Unary constraints use activity strings correctly.

The constraints are logically sound, scenario-appropriate, and consistent:
- Unary: `existence` and `exactly_one` for all 10 activities (mandatory steps, no rework assumed); `init` on `IG`; `absence` empty.
- Binary: `succession` constraints perfectly capture the inferred partial order (IGDD{TFC,CE}PC{LT,UT}AGMPFL), allowing valid parallel orderings (e.g., TFC/CE or LT/UT interchangeable).
- `nonsuccession` on `(FL, *)` (including `FL`) enforces FL as final event without repetition.
- All other keys empty (no unjustified constraints).

No inaccuracies, redundancies, contradictions, or omissions. The model permits exactly the expected traces for a successful product launch process. Flawless.
