**10.0**

### Evaluation Summary
This answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It fully adheres to the prompt by delivering a comprehensive, logically organized list of 37 targeted, open-ended questions that systematically probe missing details (e.g., verification steps, escalation paths), decision criteria (e.g., tie-breakers, severity categorization), roles/responsibilities (e.g., scheduling, approvals), timing/sequencing (e.g., timelines, gates, parallelism), and exceptions (e.g., custom clauses, pauses, multi-property handling). Every question directly references or logically extends elements from the provided process description without introducing inaccuracies, assumptions, or extraneous content. No SQL queries, implementation details, or closed-ended questions appear. Structure enhances usability with clear sections and numbering, aiding interviewer flow. No overlaps create redundancy; each adds unique conceptual depth. Minor stylistic nitpicks (e.g., consistent phrasing) are absent—language is precise, professional, and free of unclarities or logical flaws. Exhaustiveness without excess merits maximum score.
