The provided SQL query precisely meets all requirements: it correctly identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence using `LEAD()` window functions (ensuring direct succession with no intervening events via partitioning by `case_id` and ordering by `timestamp`), filters for time differences >5 days between the specific 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events in that sequence, collects distinct `case_id`s matching both criteria, and excludes **all events** from those cases in the final result via `NOT IN`. Null handling prevents false positives from incomplete sequences. DuckDB syntax (e.g., `INTERVAL '5 days'`, timestamp subtraction yielding interval) is accurate. Edge cases (multiple sequences per case, insufficient events, non-consecutive sequences) are handled correctly, as any matching sequence with >5 days triggers full case exclusion. The explanation accurately summarizes the logic without discrepancies. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical flaws.
