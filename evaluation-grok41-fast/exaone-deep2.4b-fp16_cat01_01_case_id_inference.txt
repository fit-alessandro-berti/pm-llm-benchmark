**2.0**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Fundamental Inaccuracies in Grouping (Severe Penalty)**: Core task is inferring cases via **patient attributes** (age/gender primary identifiers) and logical sequences. Answer fails catastrophically:
  - Event 11 (62F, minor_infection) wrongly assigned to Case 1 (45M); correctly belongs to Case 2.
  - Event 7 (45M X-ray left_leg, ties to hairline_fracture in Event 12) wrongly assigned to Case 3 (28M); belongs to Case 1.
  - Event 11 duplicated across Case 1 and Case 2 (logical impossibility; events cannot belong to multiple cases).
  - Missing events: Case 1 omits Event 7 (essential X-ray for fracture); Case 2 omits Event 14 (prescription for 62F antibiotics, logical post-consult); Case 3 omits Event 16 (recovery for 28M post-surgery). Not all 18 events uniquely covered.
- **Logical Flaws**: Sequences illogical (e.g., Case 1 has 62F consult but no matching patient; Case 3 assigns ER/fracture X-ray to knee surgery). Ignores perfect patient-attribute matches and timestamp dependencies (e.g., X-ray before fracture diagnosis).
- **Factual Errors**: Misquotes timestamps/resources everywhere (e.g., Event 1 as "08:08:05Z" vs. actual 08:05:13Z; Event 11 "Dr. Mark" vs. Dr. Smith; Event 9/13 timestamps fabricated/"corrected"). "Key Observations" propagates errors (e.g., Case 3 "skips ER" but wrongly includes unrelated X-ray).
- **Unclarities/Completeness**: No explicit case ID inference (task: "infer the case IDs"); partial coverage; verbose but non-flawless presentation doesn't salvage.
- **Partial Credit**: Identifies 3 cases and ~60% correct links (e.g., registers/triages/discharges match patients). But per strict criteria, major errors dominate; not "nearly flawless." Equivalent to ~20% accuracy on event assignments.
