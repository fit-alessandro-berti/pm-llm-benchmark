**10.0**

### Evaluation Summary
This answer is flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It fully meets all requirements with zero inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws:

- **Completeness**: All events from all tables are included for every `order_id` (1001–1005). No inventions; order 1004 correctly limited to available data (creation + picking). Every order line  separate "Item Picked" event (granular, as prompted). Every delivery  separate "Order Dispatched" + "Order Arrived" (handles splits). Every invoice + payment  separate events, properly linked via IDs.
- **Chronology**: Strictly increasing timestamps *within each case* (verified for all 34 events). Global ordering by case ID is standard for event logs and enables process mining.
- **Mapping/Integration**: Perfect joins (e.g., `sales_person_id`  names, `picker_id`  names, `carrier_id`  names, `billing_person_id`  names; payments via `invoice_id`  `order_id`). Resources used optimally where data exists; blank for payments (correct, no data).
- **Activity Names**: Exactly as prompted ("Order Created", "Items Picked"  "Item Picked", "Order Dispatched", "Order Arrived", "Invoice Issued", "Payment Received"). Logical, descriptive, no extras.
- **Enrichment**: "Other Attributes" concise, relevant, traceable (e.g., item/qty, delivery_id, invoice_amount, payment_method/reference, customer details). Products/Resources tables leveraged appropriately.
- **Output**: Valid Markdown table. Intro + assumption documented precisely (only needed for 1004).
- **No Issues**: No missing events, timestamp errors, incorrect linkages, summarization flaws, or unenriched fields where data exists. Handles multiples (items/deliveries/invoices/payments) perfectly. No ambiguities.

No deductions possible; this is a model response.
