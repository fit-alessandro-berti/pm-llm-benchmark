**9.4**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (near-perfect aspects)**:
  - **Complete coverage**: All 5 orders included with *every available event* (34 rows total: 5 created + 9 picked + 10 delivery + 5 invoiced + 5 paid). No missing events, correctly handles partial cases (e.g., 1004 only 2 events).
  - **Case ID**: Perfect use of `order_id`.
  - **Timestamps**: Exact matches from source tables, chronological order *within each case* (verified all, e.g., 1002 interleaves split deliveries correctly; 1003 picking before dispatch).
  - **Activity names**: Logical and derived correctly ("Order Created", "Order Dispatched", "Order Arrived", "Invoice Issued", "Payment Received"). "Item Picked" is a reasonable inference for per-line events despite prompt's "Items Picked event(s)" example (noted in assumptions).
  - **Resources**: Flawlessly mapped using Resources table where applicable (sales for created, pickers for picked, carriers for delivery events, billers for invoices; blank for payments reasonable as no ID).
  - **Linking/Integration**: Perfect joins (e.g., payments via invoice_id to order_id; multiples like 1002's 2 deliveries/2 invoices/2 payments).
  - **Output format**: Correct Markdown table, grouped by case (standard for event logs), with required columns.
  - **Documentation**: Excellent assumptions/notes cover naming, mapping, chronology, missing data.
  - **Chronological correctness**: No violations of real flow (e.g., no invoice before dispatch where illogical; dates reflect data).

- **Minor Inaccuracies/Unclarities/Flaws (strict penalties)**:
  - **Activity naming (-0.2)**: "Item Picked" (singular) deviates slightly from example "Items Picked" (plural), even if logical for per-item granularity. Hypercritical: not exact match to suggested phrasing.
  - **Other Attributes incompleteness (-0.4)**: Selective/relevant but misses key available data consistently:
    | Event Type | Included | Missed (relevant/available) | Count Affected |
    |------------|----------|-----------------------------|---------------|
    | Item Picked | item_id | quantity (core order line data) | 9 rows |
    | Delivery | delivery_id | delivery_note | 10 rows |
    | Invoice | invoice_id | invoice_amount | 5 rows |
    | Payment | payment_method | payment_reference (planned in <think> but omitted in all 5) | 5 rows |
    Not "any additional relevant data" fully; inconsistent enrichment reduces comprehensiveness.
  - **Table formatting nitpicks (-0.1)**: Minor trailing spaces in some "Other Attributes" (e.g., 1001 payment "Credit Card    "), blank resources render as wide empty cells; Markdown renders fine but unpolished.
  - **No major logical flaws/criminality/etc.**: Irrelevant here.

Nearly flawless (core 100% correct, process mining-ready log), but cumulative minor omissions of available data and tiny naming deviation prevent 10.0 under hyper-strict criteria. 9.4 reflects excellence with deductions only for specified issues.
