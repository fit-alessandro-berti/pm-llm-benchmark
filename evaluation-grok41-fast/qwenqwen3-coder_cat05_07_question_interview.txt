**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong overall—comprehensive, well-structured, directly aligned with the prompt's goals (missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, exceptions), and flawlessly avoids SQL or implementation details (despite borderline probes like tools/protocols in Q27, which stay conceptual by focusing on *how* tracking works rather than tech specs). All 30 questions are targeted, open-ended, and elicit narrative responses for conceptual depth. Grouping with headings enhances usability without detracting. No inaccuracies or logical flaws in content alignment to the process description.

**Minor flaws deducting 0.8 points (strict penalty per instructions):**
- **Timing/sequencing verification is solid but not exhaustive** (0.4 deduction): Questions like Q13 (scheduling coordination), Q14 (resolution times), Q27 (progress/handoffs), and Q10 (influence on rest of process) cover it well implicitly, but lack 1-2 explicit global probes (e.g., "What’s a typical end-to-end timeline?" or "What dependencies exist between steps, and how do delays propagate?"). Prompt explicitly lists "verify timing and sequencing," so lighter emphasis = minor gap.
- **Slight over-specificity in a few questions risks narrowing responses** (0.2 deduction): E.g., Q8 ("formal system or *more informal judgment*?") and Q27 ("specific tools or protocols") introduce mild binaries/framing, potentially biasing away from pure open-endedness, though still broadly phrased.
- **Length and redundancy** (0.2 deduction): 30 questions is a "series" but borders on exhaustive questionnaire; minor overlap (e.g., exceptions probed in Q9/12/20/24/28-30) could tighten to 20-25 without loss, making it feel less conversational.

Nearly flawless (thus high score), but these nitpicks prevent perfection under hyper-strict criteria. Any higher would ignore prompt-specified elements.
