**10.0**

The provided answer is exemplary: comprehensive, logically rigorous, and precisely aligned with the normative description. It correctly distills the process model without introducing extraneous assumptions, accurately identifies deviating cases (2, 3, 5) while clearing conformant ones (1, 4), and provides clear, evidence-based explanations tied directly to the text's constraints (e.g., sequencing, mutual exclusivity of paths, mandatory steps). No inaccuracies, unclarities, overinterpretations, or logical flaws—even hypercritical scrutiny finds zero issues, as phrasing like "immediately after" is faithfully interpretive of "next logical step" and "must precede," with no impact on case assessments (all traces comply). Structure enhances readability without redundancy. Summary is concise and reinforces findings. Flawless performance merits maximum score.
