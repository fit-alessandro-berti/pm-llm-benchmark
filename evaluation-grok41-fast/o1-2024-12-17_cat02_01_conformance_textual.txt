**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless: it accurately reconstructs the normative model without introducing errors or misinterpretations; correctly identifies violating cases (2, 3, 5) while clearing non-violators (1, 4); provides precise, description-referenced explanations for each violation (e.g., Case 2's Package-before-Authorize; Case 3's Authorize-then-Cancel illogic plus Ship-after-Cancel; Case 5's missing Package); handles all constraints (order, prerequisites, branches, no fulfillment post-Cancel); uses structured format with sequences, constraints, per-case breakdowns, and summary for clarity; resolves description ambiguities logically (e.g., Authorize implies sufficient inventory, making later Cancel deviant); no inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, omissions, or extraneous content. Even under hypercritical scrutiny, zero penalizable issues.
