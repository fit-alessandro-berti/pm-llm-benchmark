**7.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Hypercritical Assessment):
- **Correctness (major deduction: -1.5)**: All four queries functionally achieve the goal of filtering cases with 6 events and returning their events. However, **Solution 1 (labeled "Recommended") explicitly selects only `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`**, omitting any additional columns (the table has *"at least"* these, implying potential others like `user_id` or `resource`). This fails to return the *"full set of events"*, violating the prompt. Other solutions use `SELECT *` (correct). Promoting a flawed query as "most recommended" amplifies the error.
- **Completeness (deduction: -0.8)**: Provides *multiple* solutions (extra credit for thoroughness), covering efficient DuckDB patterns like `QUALIFY`. Recommendations are sensible (e.g., `QUALIFY` for DuckDB). But **comparison table is entirely empty/unfinished**—headers only, no values. Sloppy and unclear; renders section useless.
- **Clarity & Style (minor deductions: -0.3)**: Well-structured with advantages per solution, readable code blocks. Title "Filter Cases with 6 Events" is imprecise ("6 Events" implies exactly 6, not 6; prompt specifies "six or fewer"). Markdown formatting is good but table failure undermines.
- **Efficiency/Portability (neutral+)**: Solutions are performant (window functions optimal); notes DuckDB-specificity. No logical flaws in execution.
- **Adherence to Prompt (deduction: -0.2)**: Prompt asks for *"a"* (singular) query; extras are helpful but verbose. Fully addresses grouping/filtering.

**Nearly flawless? No**—Solution 1 flaw + empty table are tangible inaccuracies preventing 9+. Strong overall (hence not <7), but strictness demands penalty for recommending incomplete query and incomplete content. Fix those for 9.5+.
