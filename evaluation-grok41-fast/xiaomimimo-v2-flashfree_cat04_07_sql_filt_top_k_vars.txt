The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It fully satisfies all four task requirements with precise DuckDB SQL:

- Correctly extracts ordered sequences using `list(activity ORDER BY timestamp)` per `case_id`.
- Groups by `activity_sequence` (array equality works perfectly in DuckDB), counts frequencies, and ranks via `dense_rank()` (optimal for ties, as it includes all at the Kth boundary without arbitrary exclusion).
- Filters to top-K cases via clean join.
- Returns exact `event_log` events (`el.*`) for those cases, ordered appropriately.

No logical flaws: handles ties correctly (prompt unspecified, but `dense_rank()` is defensible and superior to `row_number()`). Efficient CTE structure. DuckDB-specific features (e.g., `list()` with `ORDER BY`) used accurately. No schema assumptions beyond prompt. Final output preserves all original events/columns.

Explanation is exemplary: step-by-step, with input/output traces and a fully runnable, self-contained example (CREATE/INSERT/query/output) that verifies correctness (e.g., top-2 includes freq-3 + freq-2 variants, excluding lowers). Minor nit (initial query shows K=3, example K=2) is stylistic, not functional—K is properly parameterized.

Zero inaccuracies, unclarities, or inefficiencies. Deserves maximum score.
