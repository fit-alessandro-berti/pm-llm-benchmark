**Grade: 1.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Summary
- **Table Formatting (Critical Failure)**: Invalid Markdown. Rows do not each represent a single event with full columns; Case ID cells are empty or misaligned (e.g., "|            | Items Collected"), breaking table structure. No proper one-row-per-event format. Unreadable as a valid event log table.
- **Timestamp Accuracy (Critical Failure)**: Nearly all timestamps are fabricated/hallucinated, ignoring table data. Examples:
  | Actual Data | Answer's Fake Timestamp | Issue |
  |-------------|--------------------------|-------|
  | Order 1001 Created: 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z | Correct (rare exception) | - |
  | 1001 Picking: 2024-01-02T10:15/11:00Z | 2024-01-01T11:00:00Z | Wrong date/day. |
  | 1001 Dispatch: 2024-01-03T08:30:00Z | 2024-01-01T10:45:00Z | Wrong date; non-chronological (after picking but before?). |
  | 1001 Arrival: 2024-01-05T14:45:00Z | 2024-01-01T13:30:00Z | Wrong date. |
  | 1001 Invoice: 2024-01-06T09:00:00Z | 2024-01-05T12:00:00Z | Wrong. |
  | 1001 Payment: 2024-01-10T11:30:00Z | 2024-01-05T15:00:00Z | Wrong. |
  Similar errors everywhere; violates "Map Timestamps" and "chronological correctness."
- **Event Coverage & Derivation (Critical Failure)**: Incomplete/inaccurate per order_id. Ignores multiples (e.g., 1001/1002/1003/1005 have multi-lines/deliveries/invoices/payments  no separate events or proper aggregation). Missing events (e.g., 1004 has picking but none listed; no payments for several). 1003 picking actually 2024-01-05T15:30/15:45Z, not 01-03. No "Items Picked" exactly as specified; renamed arbitrarily.
- **Case Integration/Linking (Failure)**: No proper key joins (e.g., payments via invoice_idorder_id ignored; deliveries not fully mapped). Order 1004/1003 lack deliveries/invoices in data, but answer invents unrelated events without noting.
- **Resources/Actors (Failure)**: Entirely invented ("Warehouse Team", "Finance Team") vs. using tables (e.g., sales_person_id=SP-001Alice Brown; picker_id=WH-001David Lin; Resources table provided but ignored).
- **Chronology (Failure)**: Violated within cases (e.g., 1001 dispatch before items?).
- **Activities (Partial Fail)**: Some match prompt examples loosely, but inconsistent/names altered without logic.
- **Other Attributes (Fail)**: Vague/irrelevant inventions; no relevant data (e.g., quantity, carrier_id, amount).
- **Assumptions/Documentation (Fail)**: Notes claim "chronological" (false), "all events confirmed" (false), but no specific per-table mappings or handling of multiples/missing (e.g., no delivery for 1004).
- **Completeness**: Misses orders fully (e.g., 1002 has 2 deliveries/2 invoices/2 payments  should derive 2x Dispatch/Arrive/Invoice/Pay events); no Products/Resources integration.

Zero adherence to data-driven integration; pure fabrication. Minimal structure attempt prevents 0.0, but "nearly flawless" impossible here.
