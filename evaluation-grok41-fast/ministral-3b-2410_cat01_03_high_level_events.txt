**5.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Major Logical Flaw in Grouping (Deduction: -3.0 from potential 10):** The "Quality Inspection" group is semantically incoherent and inaccurate. "Measure weld integrity" and "Visual check" are true inspections (verification steps). However, "Apply protective coating" and "Dry coating" are *production/finishing steps* (material application and curing), not inspections. Lumping them together misrepresents manufacturing phases: inspection verifies quality, while coating/drying *creates* a quality attribute. This violates "coherent stage" requirement and prompt examples (e.g., distinct "Quality Inspection"). A flawless answer would separate (e.g., "Weld Inspection," "Finishing," "Final Check") or justify tightly (it doesn't). Rationale falsely labels all as "quality assurance," stretching the term beyond checks to production—unacceptable for domain relevance.

- **Incomplete Temporal/Resource Logic (Deduction: -1.0):** Prompt specifies grouping by temporal proximity, resource type, or logical sequence. "Measure weld integrity" occurs immediately post-welding (10s gap), by a sensor (distinct from operators/tools), logically tying to assembly—not distant coating (10-20s later, different resources). No explanation addresses this; grouping ignores it, creating discontinuity.

- **Rationale Weaknesses/Unclarities (Deduction: -0.5):** Rationales are superficial. Material Prep/Assembly are adequate but generic ("initial setup," "actual assembly"). Quality rationale is vague ("part of the quality assurance process") without addressing why production steps fit inspection or cross-case consistency (minor timestamp diffs ignored). No mention of patterns across A1/B2 cases, despite prompt's multi-case sample.

- **Output Format/Structure Issues (Deduction: -0.5):** JSON is structured but has inconsistencies: rationales shortened vs. prose (e.g., Quality loses "checking integrity... final visual"), risking ambiguity. Redundant "**Name:**" headers in prose (repeated per section). No timestamps/CaseID/resources in groups, despite prompt emphasizing attributes for inference—missed chance for robust justification.

- **Minor Completeness Gaps (Deduction: -0.0):** Covers all events and both cases; names domain-relevant; summary ties back to goal.

- **Strengths (Not Enough for Higher Score):** Good coverage, sequence respect, JSON format, clear prose. But flaws are not minor—core grouping inaccuracy undermines "meaningful higher-level process steps," failing strict "nearly flawless" threshold.

Overall: Competent structure/effort, but critical semantic/logical errors prevent >5.0 under hypercritical standards.
