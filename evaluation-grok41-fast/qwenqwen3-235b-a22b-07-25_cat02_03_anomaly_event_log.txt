**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless: it accurately identifies all key anomalies across cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 with precise timestamp-based evidence, correctly deems 1001 compliant, provides logically sound explanations rooted in standard P2P controls (e.g., approval gates, 3-way matching, temporal sequencing), highlights specific risks (fraud, compliance, financial), uses a clear summary table, and offers practical recommendations. No inaccuracies, omissions, logical flaws, or unclarities; structure enhances readability without redundancy.
