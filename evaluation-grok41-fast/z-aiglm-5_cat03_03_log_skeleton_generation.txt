**7.5**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Output Only):
- **Strengths (Supporting Higher Score)**:
  - Captures the linear "series of activities" flow accurately: RO  CA  RI  PI  QC  PO  GSL  D  IC  RP.
  - `activ_freq`: Perfect for happy-path fulfillment; all `{1}` aligns with "must be processed through" implying completion, no loops/exceptions mentioned. All 10 activities included.
  - `always_after` / `always_before`: Flawless chain of adjacent dependencies; tuples are precise inverses (e.g., `(RO, CA)` in after  `(CA, RO)` in before). Logically sound for eventual ordering.
  - `directly_follows`: Strong representation of main sequence; warehouse steps (RO-D) are spot-on immediate. Linking DIC reasonable (invoice often triggered by dispatch).
  - `equivalence`: Reasonable subset of bindings (e.g., RO  D/RP enforces process completion; PI  QC, PO  GSL for paired steps). Valid given uniform `{1}` counts.
  - `never_together`: Conceptually correct (empty; no XOR paths like cancel/out-of-stock in scenario).

- **Flaws (Strict Deductions)**:
  - **Critical Syntax/Type Error (`never_together`)**: `{}` parses as `dict`, not `set`. Violates spec ("sets containing pairs (tuples)"). Invalid Python Log Skeleton—would fail type checks or usage (e.g., adding tuples). Fatal for "construct a Python dictionary"; deducts ~2.0+ points.
  - **Logical Flaw in `directly_follows`**: `('IC', 'RP')` asserts *immediate* succession, but scenario states "once the customer pays" implying real-world delay/wait (not log-immediate). Overly rigid; minor for warehouse but flawed for billing. Deducts ~0.5.
  - **Minor Over-Specificity**: `equivalence` picks arbitrary pairs (valid but not *necessary*; could be minimal/empty). No unclarities, but hypercritically not "derived solely from scenario" without extras.
  - No other issues: Valid tuples, full coverage, comments ignored for grading.

Nearly flawless logic/structure elevates from low-6s, but syntax invalidity + RP direct-follow prevents 9+. Perfect would fix `set()`, drop/weaken `('IC','RP')`, minimal equivalence.
