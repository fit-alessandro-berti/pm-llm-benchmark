**9.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Correctness (flawless)**: The SQL query is logically perfect. It accurately computes event counts per `case_id` via CTE, joins back correctly using an INNER JOIN (safe since the CTE covers all cases), and filters precisely with `WHERE ec.event_count <= 6` to exclude cases >6 events while returning `el.*` (all original columns/events). Matches the requirement exactly: full events from qualifying cases only. No errors in grouping, aggregation, or filtering. Works in DuckDB.
- **Completeness**: Addresses all aspects—counts per case, exclusion of >6, return full events. Handles "at least" columns without assuming extras.
- **Clarity/Structure**: Excellent CTE for readability, step-by-step breakdown, key features list. `<think>` shows sound reasoning/planning.
- **DuckDB Specificity**: Appropriate (CTEs, COUNT(*), JOIN fully supported/optimized).

**Deductions (strict/hypercritical for minor issues)**:
- **Inaccuracy on ordering (major ding, -0.5)**: Claims "Maintains original event ordering in the final result", "preserving ... including their original timestamp order" (twice). SQL guarantees **no order** without `ORDER BY timestamp` (e.g., `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp`). DuckDB may preserve scan order coincidentally, but it's not "maintained" or "preserved"—pure speculation/false assurance. Problem doesn't require sorting, but false claim is an inaccuracy/logical flaw.
- **Minor overclaim on efficiency (-0.2)**: "Efficiently filters cases **before** returning associated events"—filter is post-JOIN logically (though optimizable); slight misleading. Alternative `WHERE case_id IN (SELECT ... HAVING COUNT(*) <=6)` avoids join entirely but isn't required—still, phrasing implies superiority.
- **Unnecessary verbosity (-0.1)**: "Works with DuckDB's SQL dialect and optimization capabilities"—obvious/tautological, pads without value.

**Overall**: Nearly flawless core (query/explanation 95%+ perfect), but ordering inaccuracy is a clear logical flaw (not pedantic—misleads on SQL semantics), warranting deduction per "even minor issues significantly lower"/"nearly flawless" threshold. Subquery alternative equally valid but CTE clear. 9.2 reflects excellence minus strict penalties.
