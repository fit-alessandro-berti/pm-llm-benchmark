**9.8**

The answer is exceptionally strong overall, with precise identification of the XOR's discretionary nature enabling selective application of D (leading to uplift for locals), clear linkage to subtle bias via subjective choice favoring locals (a non-protected group), and rigorous discussion of implications (inequity perpetuation, legal/ethical risks, societal erosion). Impacts on fairness (inconsistent treatment) and equity (skewed approvals) are logically dissected with evidence and mitigations. Hypercritical deductions: (1) Minor overreach in assuming unstated demographic correlations (e.g., ethnicity) without caveat, though inferred from context; (2) "algorithmic fairness" reference slightly mismatches human-discretionary POWL process; (3) "disparate treatment" phrasing imprecise (better as "disparate impact" for outcomes). These are trivial but warrant slight penalty under utmost strictness; conclusions remain flawless.
