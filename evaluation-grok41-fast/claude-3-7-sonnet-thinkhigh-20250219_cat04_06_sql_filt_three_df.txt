**7.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**:
  - Perfectly captures "direct succession" using row_number() joins on consecutive row_nums – flawless logic for no intervening events.
  - Correctly identifies cases with DISTINCT case_id where condition applies.
  - Proper exclusion via NOT IN subquery, returning events only from non-matching cases.
  - Well-structured CTEs, readable, efficient for DuckDB.
  - ORDER BY case_id, timestamp adds proper ordering as hinted.
  - Explanation is clear, accurate, and matches query steps.

- **Major Logical Flaw (-2.0 deduction)**:
  - Time condition `date_diff('day', create_timestamp, confirm_timestamp) > 5` is **incorrect** for "time elapsed ... more than 5 days".
    - DuckDB's `date_diff('day', ts1, ts2)` computes **calendar days between date parts** (i.e., `date(ts2) - date(ts1)`), **ignoring time-of-day**.
    - Examples:
      | create | confirm | Actual elapsed | date_diff('day') | Correct? (>5 days?) |
      |--------|---------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
      | 2024-01-01 00:00 | 2024-01-06 12:00 | **5.5 days** (>5) | 5 (false negative) | Should exclude, doesn't |
      | 2024-01-01 12:00 | 2024-01-06 11:00 | **4 days 23h** (<5) | 4 (correct) | Correctly not exclude |
      | 2024-01-01 00:00 | 2024-01-05 23:59:59 | **4 days 23h59m** (<5) | **5** (false positive) | Should not exclude, does |
    - Precise fix: `(confirm_timestamp - create_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5' DAY` or `confirm_timestamp > create_timestamp + INTERVAL '5' DAY`.
    - This causes **wrong results** in common cases – unacceptable for benchmark.

- **Minor Inaccuracy (-0.5 deduction)**:
  - Final SELECT only returns `case_id, activity, timestamp`, but prompt specifies "return **all events** from `event_log`" ("at least" those columns, implying possible others like resources/users).
    - Should use `SELECT *` to return complete events.
    - Returns incomplete rows, violating "all events".

- **Minor Edge Cases (-0.5 deduction)**:
  - Assumes strictly increasing unique `timestamp` per `case_id`; ties yield arbitrary row_num order, potentially missing/misidentifying sequences (add `, event_id` or `, activity` to ORDER BY for determinism).
  - Handles multiple sequences per case correctly (excludes if **any** >5 days), matching "contains the ... sequence".

Nearly flawless structure/logic elevates from low score, but logical flaw in core timing condition + incompleteness prevent >8.0. Fix those = 10.0.
