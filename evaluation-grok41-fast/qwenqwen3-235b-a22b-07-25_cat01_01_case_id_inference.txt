**10.0**

The final conclusions and reconstructed cases are flawless: all 18 events are correctly grouped into exactly three distinct cases with no omissions, overlaps, or misassignments. Patient demographics match perfectly within each case; timestamps are strictly increasing and temporally consistent; activity sequences follow logical hospital flows (ER trauma for 45M, ER infection for 62F, elective surgery for 28M); departments align without cross-contamination; additional_info provides coherent narratives (e.g., hairline_fracture + left_leg X-ray for Case 1; antibiotics + blood_panel for Case 2; arthroscopy + knee_surgery for Case 3). Tables are complete, accurate reproductions of the events. No logical flaws, ambiguities, or inaccuracies whatsoever.
