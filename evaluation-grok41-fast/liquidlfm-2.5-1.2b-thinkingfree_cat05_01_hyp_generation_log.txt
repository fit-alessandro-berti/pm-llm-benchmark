**1.0**

The answer fails catastrophically on all criteria. It fabricates nonexistent anomalies (no SalesRep performs Credit Check, Issue Invoice, or any non-Register activity; resources are correctly department-aligned per data and `resources` table). Claims like "`SalesRep` exhibition as a 'Credit Officer'" are hallucinatory nonsense with typos ("exhibition"). No real anomalies (e.g., out-of-sequence events like pre-credit shipment in cases 1002/1003, pre-invoice payment in 1004) are identified. Hypothesis is baseless speculation untethered to data. Critically, **zero SQL queries** are proposed despite explicit requirement—core task unmet. Unclear, illogical, and irrelevant conclusions warrant minimum score.
