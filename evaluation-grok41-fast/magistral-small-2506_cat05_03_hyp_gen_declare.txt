**3.2**

### Rationale for Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies Identification (Major Flaws, ~20% credit)**: Fundamentally misunderstands `noncoexistence("E", "C")` as implying order ("E must happen before C") rather than mutual exclusion (no trace can contain *both* E *and* C). This is a critical error—combined with `existence("C")=1.0` (every trace must have C) and `init("R")`, it *forbids E entirely* (contradicting intended flow requiring E and `responded_existence` implying E after A). Answer claims "no direct contradiction," calls rules "redundant," and focuses on "missing dependencies" (valid but secondary). Ignores how model *blocks ideal flow (R-A-E-P-N-C)* while allowing undesired skips (e.g., R-C only). Logical flaws and incompleteness warrant severe penalty.
- **Hypotheses (Adequate but Generic, ~60% credit)**: Covers standard reasons (misinterpretation, incremental changes, data issues, speed pressure) without tying to *specific* anomalies (e.g., no mention of why `noncoexistence(E,C)` was erroneously strict). Repetitive and lacks depth/originality.
- **Verification Approaches (Strongest Section, ~80% credit)**: SQL queries are mostly correct, PostgreSQL-compatible, and relevant:
  - Q1: Detects undesired skips (C sans E)—good for model's leniency.
  - Q2: Detects model's noncoex violations (E+C coexistence)—directly probes core anomaly, despite flawed explanation ("redundant").
  - Q3: Validates `responded_existence` (E sans prior A)—precise timestamp check.
  - Q4: Exposes missing chain (C sans P/N)—useful.
  - Q5: Extra insight (adjuster mismatch)—nice but beyond model/schema necessities (assumes `resource=adjuster_id`, unverified).
  Minor issues: Q2/Q4 use `OR` incorrectly (should be `AND NOT EXISTS P AND NOT EXISTS N` for "without P *or* N"? Wait, logic is "without P OR without N", but intent is claims missing *either*, so detects if missing at least one—ok but ambiguous. Q4 has syntax error: trailing `OR` without structure. No query for full forbidden E (e.g., any E at all, since C always).
- **Overall**: Structure matches prompt perfectly. No "flow of thought" to ignore (none present). But core inaccuracies in anomaly analysis (misinterpretation + missed contradiction) are disqualifying under "hypercritical" strictness—"nearly flawless" requires zero logical flaws. Minor SQL nits compound. Rounded to 3.2 for partial query value.
