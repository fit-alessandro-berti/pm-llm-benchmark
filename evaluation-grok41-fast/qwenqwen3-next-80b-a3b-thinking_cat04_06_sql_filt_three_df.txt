The provided SQL query is correct, complete, and precisely meets all requirements. It accurately identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence using `LEAD` window functions partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `timestamp`, correctly computes the time difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events in that sequence as `(next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'`, collects those `case_id`s, and excludes all events from them via `NOT IN`. DuckDB syntax is valid (timestamp subtraction yields `INTERVAL`, comparable to `INTERVAL '5 days'`), handles edge cases (insufficient subsequent events yield `NULL` and are filtered, duplicates in subquery ignored by `NOT IN`), and returns all events (`SELECT *`) from non-matching cases without extraneous ordering/grouping. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws.
