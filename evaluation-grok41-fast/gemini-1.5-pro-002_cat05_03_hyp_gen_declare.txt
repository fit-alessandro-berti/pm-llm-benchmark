7.2

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (supporting higher score):**
- **Structure and Completeness**: Perfectly follows the three-part structure (anomalies, hypotheses, verification). Independent presentation without hints. Covers key elements like non-coexistence conflict with intended flow (E and C both needed but forbidden), allowance for skipping E, and missing constraints undermining logic.
- **Anomaly Identification**: Correctly flags core contradiction (non-coexistence E-C violates ideal flow requiring both). Good on potential close without E and missing P/N constraints.
- **Hypotheses**: Excellent—4 thoughtful, relevant suggestions directly matching prompt examples (misinterpretation, data issues, evolving processes, speed pressure). No fluff.
- **SQL Queries**: Mostly precise and relevant to prompt examples. Query 1 perfectly checks closed without E. Query 2 perfectly detects E-C coexistence (model violation). Query 4 useful addition for out-of-order C vs. P/N. PostgreSQL-compatible syntax.

**Flaws Deducting Score (strict deductions for inaccuracies/logical issues):**
- **Major Inaccuracy in DECLARE Interpretation (deduct 1.5)**: States " 'E' must be preceded by 'A' " from responded_existence. Wrong—standard DECLARE `responded_existence` {"E": ["A"]} means *A responded by E* (every A followed by E later), **not** E requires prior A (which would be `precedence(A,E)` or `responded_existence(E,something)`). This misstates the model, creating false premise for "contradiction between Responded Existence and Non-Coexistence" (indirect at best; no direct link without assuming A always occurs).
- **Logical Flaw in Query 3 (deduct 1.0)**: Checks E without *prior* A (timestamp <), aligning with wrong interpretation. Model violation would be A *without subsequent* E. Query verifies non-model constraint (useful for intent, but not model anomaly). Prompt example ("evaluation always correspond with assigned adjusters") implies resource/adjusters join, not done here.
- **Minor Query Issues (deduct 0.3)**: Query 4 lacks `DISTINCT` or `GROUP BY claim_id`, risks duplicate rows. Subquery `claim_events.claim_id` works but unaliased outer table sloppy (use `WHERE activity='C'` with `LEFT JOIN` or window clearer). Doesn't handle no P/N cases ( `< NULL` false, misses full skips).
- **Minor Unclarity (deduct 0.0)**: No adjusters table usage despite schema/prompt mention (e.g., no specialization/region check for assignments).

**Overall**: Strong, near-comprehensive (80%+ flawless), but core inaccuracy on key constraint + mismatched query = not "nearly flawless." 10.0 requires zero issues; this caps at mid-high 7s.
