### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (Near-Flawless Aspects)**:
  - **Matching Logic**: Correctly identifies semantic equivalents (e.g., "Order Received"  "OrderReceived", "Item Shipped"  "Shipping"). Handles non-matches perfectly ("Quality Check" separate as extra Log B event; "Item Delivered" separate as Log A-only). Payment merge is logically defensible: prompt uses "e.g., <2s" as non-binding example ("slightly offset by a few seconds"); semantics + order_id + notes ("Payment gateway delay") + no alternatives = confident match per "combination of order_id and event timing" and "appear to represent the same occurrence." 2s diffs treated as within "small tolerance" (reasonable interpretation of "less than 2s" in ISO timestamps; exactly 2s is negligible millisecond-level rounding in context).
  - **Output Format**: Exemplary table – chronological by primary timestamp (Log A prioritized correctly), all attributes merged/included (both timestamps, user_id/resource_id/notes from B, — for missing), source indication, unified types (Log A-based standardization perfect). Enriched, auditable, scannable.
  - **Chronology**: Flawless – Quality Check slots precisely at 10:03:00Z between 10:02:00Z and 10:05:00Z.
  - **Reasoning**: Comprehensive, structured (strategy + per-event + insights), transparent (admits 5s exceedance but justifies rigorously without hiding). Resolves naming/timestamps/attributes explicitly. Insights (e.g., Log B initiation vs. Log A receipt) align with prompt context. No repetition, fully documents decisions/conflicts.
  - **Completeness**: All events accounted for, no inventions/duplicates/losses. Scalability note adds value without speculation.

- **Minor Deductions (Hypercritical Lens – Preventing 10.0)**:
  - **Tolerance Interpretation**: Prompt says "less than 2 seconds" (strictly <2s); answer uses 2s for received/shipped (exactly 2s) and extends to 5s for payment. Interpretation valid ("e.g." + "few seconds"), but not verbatim – tiny stretch (0.1 deduction). Could have used averaged timestamp or flagged 2s/5s as "borderline" more cautiously.
  - **Attribute Presentation**: Notes from Log B integrated perfectly, but Log B's raw `event_name` not in separate column (e.g., "PaymentCheck" alongside "Payment Processed") – prompt says "include all attributes"; unified type + notes covers it semantically, but explicit dual event_name would be pedantic perfection (0.1 deduction).
  - **Table Typos**: "â€”" rendering (likely UTF-8 dash encoding artifact) vs. clean "—"; imperceptible but hypercritical visual glitch (0.0, ignored as rendering).

No major inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws – output directly fulfills "single, integrated event log" + "enriched attributes" + "chronological" + full reasoning. Semantic flexibility overrides rigid tolerance correctly in context. Only ultra-minor nits prevent absolute 10.0.
