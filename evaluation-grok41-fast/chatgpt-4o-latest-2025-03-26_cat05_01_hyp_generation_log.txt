**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (supporting score above 5):**
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Identifies nearly all major anomalies (out-of-sequence events in 1002/1003/1004, missing steps in 1003/1004, early payments in 1004, resource mismatches, fast turnarounds in 1002). Aligns well with normal flow and data.
- **Hypotheses**: Relevant and varied (e.g., workflow enforcement lacks, manual overrides, role conflicts, fast-tracks). Ties to process mining concepts like policy violations/system errors.
- **SQL queries**: 90%+ accurate for PostgreSQL. Correct use of self-joins, CASE/MIN for timestamps, LEFT JOINs for missing events, EXTRACT(EPOCH), GROUP BY. Queries are investigative (generalize beyond examples) and use `orders`/`resources` appropriately. No syntax errors; would execute correctly on schema.
- **Structure**: Logical sections, summary table (despite incompleteness), actionable final notes. Encourages further tailoring.

**Flaws Deducting from Perfection (strict deductions for inaccuracies/unclarities/logic):**
- **Factual inaccuracies in observations (major: -1.5 total)**:
  - Section 2: "`No “Register Order” for `case_id=1002` before shipment confirmation`". **False** – Event 8 is "Register Order" at 08:20:00, *before* Confirm Shipment (08:25). Direct misreading of provided table data undermines anomaly detection credibility.
  - Section 4: "`FinanceTeam_02` (a **Cashier**) is issuing invoices in some cases`". **False** – FinanceTeam_02 *only* handles "Receive Payment" (1001/1002/1003/1004); invoices are by FinanceTeam_01/03. Resources table confirms role, but claim is baseless/invented.
- **Logical/minor observation flaws (-0.8)**:
  - Section 2 claims 1004 "miss[es] “Perform Credit Check” and “Validate Stock” altogether" (correct), but implies 1002 lacks early validation without noting it *has* Register Order – compounds the error above.
  - Section 1: "For `case_id = 1002`, **Confirm Shipment** ... before **Credit Check**" correct, but overlooks that 1002 *has* all 7 activities (just reordered), slightly blurring "skipped" vs. "reordered".
  - Ignores subtler issues like 1004's `shipment_scheduled=N` yet still "Ship Goods"; low credit scores (650/720) proceeding; no invoice before payment in 1004 explicitly flagged beyond sequence.
- **SQL/execution issues (-0.3)**:
  - Section 3 SQL: HAVING clause uses MIN(payment) < MIN(invoice), correct but assumes single instances (true here, unstated). Minor: No join to `orders` for context.
  - Section 4 second SQL: Filters `o1.resource IN (SELECT ... WHERE role LIKE '%Warehouse%')` – works but `LIKE` is fuzzy (role="Warehouse Staff"); better `role = 'Warehouse Staff'`.
  - Section 5 SQL: WHERE filters *only* cases with both activities; misses cases lacking "Register Order"/"Ship Goods". GROUP BY assumes existence.
  - Section 2 second SQL: Counts *unique* activities – useful but misses duplicates/repeats (none here); better COUNT(*) for total events.
- **Unclarities/incompleteness (-0.2)**:
  - Summary table: "Proposed SQL" column entirely blank/empty – renders it useless despite good intent.
  - No query for resource-role mismatches explicitly hypothesizes (e.g., Cashier vs. Billing).
  - Minor: "not enough validation?" for 1002 vague; "test scenarios" hypothesis speculative without data tie-in.

**Overall**: Excellent framework/SQL/hypotheses (near 9+ potential), but data misreads are *critical* for "identify anomalies in the given event log" – cannot be "nearly flawless". Equivalent to hallucinating log entries. Strict math: 10 - 1.5 (facts) - 0.8 (logic) - 0.3 (SQL nitpicks) - 0.2 (clarity) = 7.2.
