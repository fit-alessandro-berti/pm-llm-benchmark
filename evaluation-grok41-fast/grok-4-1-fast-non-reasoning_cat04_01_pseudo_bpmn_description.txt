**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is **excellent overall**—comprehensive, accurate, logically sound, and directly addresses every element of the question (purposes, gateways, paths/convergence/loops, standard/custom differences, triggers). It uses clear structure, tables for clarity, and precise diagram fidelity (e.g., viable-path convergence post-D/E1, early custom rejection, path-specific loops). Inferences (e.g., business context, triggers like high-value) enhance without fabricating. No major inaccuracies or logical flaws.

**Minor deductions (total -0.8):**
- **Numbering inconsistencies/unclarity (-0.4)**: Step-by-step numbering restarts "3." for custom B2 (after standard's 3./4./5.), skips "6." for G/F/H block, jumps to 7./8. This creates mild reader confusion in sequencing despite correct content—structural sloppiness, not fatal but hypercritically flawed.
- **Minor formatting/typo nitpicks (-0.2)**: Awkward phrasing like "Gateway (AND): ... Join**" (bold/run-on); "**Yes  Task G**" (missing arrow/hyphen); nested custom under "3." without clear indent hierarchy. Reduces polish.
- **Slight overreach (-0.2)**: Unasked extras (e.g., "scalable for Camunda/Bizagi", "add metrics") are harmless but bloat; inferred triggers (">$10K") speculative though diagram-aligned. "Implicit OR/AND join" is precise but "OR/AND" hedges unnecessarily (diagram implies simple merge).

**Why not 10.0?** Not "nearly flawless"—numbering/structural minors prevent perfection under "even minor issues significantly lower." **Why not lower?** Zero factual errors, full coverage, no logical gaps (e.g., correctly handles custom early-end, loop specificity, parallel join). Superior to 90% of responses.
