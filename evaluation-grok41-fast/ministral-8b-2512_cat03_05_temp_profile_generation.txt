**5.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Criteria):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Perfect Python dict format with correct tuple keys/values. Comprehensive representative subset (~36/45 possible forward pairs, including multi-step for complexity). Times/stddevs in seconds, plausible scales (short for direct early steps like SS-OP ~20min; longer for supply chain like OP-RC ~2 days; compounding for distant pairs). Increasing stddevs with chain length reflects realistic variability. Extra explanations add value without violating task.
- **Major Flaws (severe deductions)**:
  - **Logical inconsistencies in claimed computations**: Observations explicitly claim "summing intermediate steps" and "quadrature for stddev," but numbers don't match. E.g.:
    | Pair | Listed Avg | Direct Sum | Error |
    |------|------------|------------|--------|
    | SS-QI | 175200 | 1200+172800+3600=177600 | -1.4% (minor) |
    | SS-PT | 219600 | 1200+172800+3600+7200+21600=206400 | +6.5% |
    | RC-PT | 25200 | 3600+7200+21600=32400 | -22% |
    | QI-PK | 9000 | 7200+21600+1800=30600 | -71% (**egregious**) |
    | PT-WS | 86400 | 1800+86400=88200 | -2% |
    | WS-AS | 129600 | 43200+129600=172800 | -25% |
    Stddevs similarly off (e.g., SS-QI 22500 vs ~(360²+21600²+1800²)21710; QI-PK 2700 vs ~(2160²+5400²+900²)5850).
  - **Misleading comments**: E.g., SS-RC "same as OPRC" ignores SS-OP logically; RC-PT comment "(QICA + CAPT)" omits RC-QI; sums cited don't reproduce listed values.
  - **Incomplete coverage**: Misses key pairs like OP-AS, RC-AS, QI-AS, CA-AS, PT-AS (breaks chain completeness for AS).
  - **Arbitrary estimates**: Some implausible (PK-WS 1 day storage post-packaging?; QI-PK 2.5h for 3-step chain realistically >8h). No justification for ignoring small direct times in chains.
- **Minor Flaws (further deductions)**: Extra text beyond "produce dict" slightly bloats; no handling of potential non-linear traces despite linear scenario; ZETA mention extraneous.
- **Overall**: Good structure/effort but undermined by pervasive math/logic errors making profile unreliable for "deviation detection." Not "nearly flawless"—significant inaccuracies prevent >5.0 under hypercritical lens.
