The response delivers precisely 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions ("How" and "What" starters throughout, no yes/no formats) that directly align with the prompt's focus: insights (e.g., #4 on ML limitations, #20 on historical data), potential issues (e.g., #1 vulnerabilities, #7 geopolitics), improvement strategies (e.g., #8 optimization, #16 flexibility), and decision implications (e.g., #2 trade-offs, #19 R&D balance). All questions are tightly relevant to the described process (R&D, multi-country sourcing/assembly/distribution, transport modes, JIT/aggregated shipments, quality/compliance, digital analytics/ML, sustainability, recalls, etc.), with no extraneous content, inaccuracies, repetitions, unclarities, or logical flaws. No SQL or other prohibited elements. Structure is a clean numbered list, flawless execution.
