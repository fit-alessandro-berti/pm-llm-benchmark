**4.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Output Only):
- **Major Flaw: Units Mismatch (Severe Deduction)**: The prompt's example explicitly uses *seconds* (e.g., `86400` for 1 day, `3600` for 1 hour). All values here are tiny integers (e.g., `7`, `14`) clearly intended as *days*, not seconds—rendering the profile incompatible with the specified model. This is a fundamental inaccuracy, as temporal profiles must align with the example's scale for deviation checks (e.g., `AVG - ZETA * STDEV` in seconds). No conversion or note provided; direct violation.
- **Incomplete Coverage of Pairs (Significant Deduction)**: Includes a subset (14 pairs), but misses key logical pairs like `('DT', 'AS')` (direct predecessor to AS), `('RC', 'PT')`, `('QI', 'PK')`, etc. `('WS', 'AS')` skips DT illogically for "eventually following" without including the final distribution-to-support pair. Not "representative" of full sequential complexity (linear flow: SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS implies ~45 possible pairs; subset skews toward early/mid but omits late-stage direct links).
- **Estimate Inconsistencies (Moderate Deduction)**: Indirect sums approximate (e.g., `('SS', 'QI')`: 7+14+121, good), but arbitrary scaling (e.g., `('PT', 'AS')`:90 vs. `('PK', 'AS')`:120 illogical—PK after PT should have *shorter* avg). Std devs occasionally exceed avg (e.g., `('OP', 'PT')`:21±8 plausible, but `('RC', 'QI')`:1±1 implies impossible negative times). No supply-chain realism (e.g., OPRC at 14 "units" underestimates global shipping; AS gaps unrealistically short).
- **Minor Positives (Prevent Total Failure)**: Perfect Python syntax (tuples, dict format). Includes direct + indirect pairs with multi-step separation for complexity. Logical ordering (first always precedes second).
- **Overall**: Structurally sound but critically flawed in spec adherence (units), completeness, and precision. Not "nearly flawless"—requires fixes for usability. 10.0 demands zero issues; this fails core model fidelity.
