**10.0**

### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It fully adheres to the prompt by delivering a comprehensive list of **targeted, open-ended questions** that precisely uncover missing details (e.g., Q2 on checklists, Q5 on additional data points), decision criteria (e.g., Q7 on assignment weighting, Q18 on tenant scoring), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q4 on contract validation, Q19 on applicant selection), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q3 on SLAs, Q14 on repair turnaround), and exception handling (e.g., Q8 on no-match scenarios, Q23 on frequent exceptions). No questions request SQL, code, or low-level implementation— all remain strictly conceptual (e.g., "algorithm" in Q7 is framed as formal/informal business logic, not technical details). Coverage maps exhaustively to the process description without extraneous topics. Questions are logically grouped for clarity (enhancing usability without being required), phrased neutrally/open-ended (all "how/what/which"), non-leading, and free of unclarities, inaccuracies, or logical flaws. The intro and closing sentence provide crisp context without fluff. No overlaps create redundancy; even dense coverage (30 questions) is efficient and non-repetitive. Zero minor issues justify deduction—award maximal score.
