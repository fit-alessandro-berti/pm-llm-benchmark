**10.0**

The provided answer is a flawless execution of the task requirements. It delivers a valid Python dictionary with exactly the specified structure: tuple keys for ordered activity pairs (all drawn from the 10 listed activities, respecting the implied sequential flow where earlier activities precede later ones), and tuple values of (average_time, standard_deviation) using realistic, second-denominated integers. The selection is a representative subset (21 pairs) that aptly demonstrates complexity, mixing direct consecutive pairs (9) with multi-step skips (12 spans of 2–9+ activities, e.g., SS-PT spans 6 steps, SS-DT spans 8). Cumulative averages align precisely or very closely with sums of constituent direct intervals (e.g., SS-RC = 19 days  SS-OP 5d + OP-RC 14d; RC-PT = 3.5d = RC-QI 1d + QI-CA 0.5d + CA-PT 2d; variances scale proportionally for realism). Standard deviations increase appropriately with span length and external variability (e.g., low for internal steps like PK-WS ~4h ±2h; high for OP-RC ~14d ±7d or DT-AS ~30d ±15d). No inaccuracies, invalid pairs, formatting errors, or extraneous content; comments enhance clarity without detracting. Perfectly matches supply chain realism for high-tech electronics.
