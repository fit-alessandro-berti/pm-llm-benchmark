**2.0**

### Reasoning for Grade
- **Major flaws in core logic (fatal to requirements)**: The query only extracts the *first* activity (`seq_num = 1`) per case as a proxy for "variants," ignoring the complete ordered sequence of *all* activities per case. This violates task #1 (full sequence per case), #2 (group by complete sequence), and #3 (count cases per full variant).
- **Incorrect grouping and counting**: `variant_count` groups by `case_id, activity, seq_num` (redundant and wrong for variants), and `top_k_variants` uses `ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC` on malformed data, not actual variant frequencies across cases. No proper variant representation (e.g., no `LISTAGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY seq_num)` or `array_agg(activity ORDER BY seq_num)` to hash sequences).
- **Wrong final output**: Returns only first-activity rows with `seq_num` (no `timestamp`, incomplete columns), not "all events from the original event log" for top-K cases (task #4). No join back to `event_log` on selected `case_id`s; excludes non-top-K cases incorrectly.
- **Unparameterized K**: Hardcodes `LIMIT 10`; task implies general "top K" (e.g., parameter).
- **Self-admitted incompleteness**: Explanation and Note explicitly state it fails on full sequences ("need a different approach"), confirming it's not a working solution.
- **Minor issues compounding**: No DuckDB-specific optimizations; verbose/redundant CTEs; claimed "Final Output" misrepresents what the query does.
- **Why not 1.0?** Minimal credit for correct `ROW_NUMBER()` usage and CTE structure attempting ordering/row numbering, showing partial grasp of step #1. But hypercritical evaluation demands near-flawless correctness; this is non-functional for the benchmark.
