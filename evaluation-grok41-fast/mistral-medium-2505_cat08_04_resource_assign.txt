**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—nearly flawless in structure, coverage, PM grounding, and actionability—but deducts slightly for minor issues under utmost strictness: (1) hypothetical quantifications presented semi-factually without full derivation from the snippet (e.g., "~15-30 minutes" approximates snippet delays like 25min for INC-1001 L2 start but isn't precisely calculated/tied; "~40%" labeled "hypothetical" but integrated as log-based without caveats on snippet limitations); (2) strategies lack *explicit* per-strategy sentences linking to specific PM insights (e.g., no "This leverages the social network analysis from 1.2 showing handover bottlenecks"); implied but not detailed as tasked; (3) some implementations high-level/not ultra-concrete (e.g., no pseudocode/algorithm sketch for "proficiency weighting"); (4) monitoring "plan" is KPI list + dashboards, not a step-by-step outline (e.g., no phased rollout or conformance checking). No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities; all PM terms (social networks, role discovery, variant/decision mining) precisely relevant to resource analysis; fully data-driven from log attributes; perfect sectioning; no extras detract. These minors warrant ~0.8 deduction from 10.0; anything less would be unfair.
