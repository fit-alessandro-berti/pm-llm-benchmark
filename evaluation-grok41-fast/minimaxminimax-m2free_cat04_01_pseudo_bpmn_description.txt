### Hypercritical Evaluation Summary
This answer is exceptionally strong—comprehensive, well-structured, logically sound, and directly addresses every element of the question with precise mappings to the pseudo-BPMN. It infers reasonable business purposes for each task (e.g., credit/inventory for fulfillment viability, feasibility for custom viability) without hallucinating unsupported details. Gateways are explained accurately (XOR exclusivity, AND parallelism), paths are differentiated clearly, convergence is correctly noted as implicit post-D/E1 (only viable paths reach approval XOR; rejection bypasses correctly), and loops are faithfully described (to D/E1 via XOR router, no re-feasibility for custom loops). Scenarios illustrate dynamically without errors. Improvements are optional enhancements, not critiques.

**Minor deductions (-0.8 total):**
- **Wording inaccuracy (-0.3):** "After both branches rejoin" (gateways section) is imprecise; XOR ensures *one* branch reaches the approval XOR, not "both" (though context clarifies via earlier "each end at"). Hyper-strict: logical flaw in phrasing.
- **Slight overreach in loop termination (-0.3):** Describes custom loop ending if "Conditions become unfeasible"; diagram loops directly to E1 (post-feasibility), so unfeasibility can't trigger rejection mid-loop without implied re-B2 (unsupported). Minor speculation, but presented as fact.
- **Scenario assumption (-0.1):** Standard example posits "inventory check fails" yet joins/proceeds to D "accordingly"—pseudo-BPMN's AND join implies completion regardless of outcome (result feeds D), but doesn't explicitly handle failure rejection; safe inference but not diagram-exact.
- **Unnecessary jargon (-0.1):** "any-flow" for convergence (BPMN uses sequence flow; "any-flow" is nonstandard/vague).

No major inaccuracies, unclarities, or omissions (all tasks/gateways/paths/loops covered; triggers inferred logically as "not shown" with examples). No logical flaws in flow (e.g., correctly skips approval for rejection). Structure enhances readability. Flawless would be zero nits—hence not 10.0.
