**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Analysis)
- **Anomalies Identification (Strong, ~9/10)**: Accurately lists and describes the 4 key anomalies (R-P low STDEV, P-N high avg/variability, A-C short without intermediates, E-N suspiciously short). Matches provided model precisely. Minor formatting nit (e.g., "R  P" spacing), but descriptions note correct issues (rigidity, inconsistency, skipping, rushing).
  
- **Hypotheses Generation (Strong, ~8.5/10)**: Provides 2 hypotheses per anomaly, directly aligning with prompt examples (e.g., automated/rigid processes, backlogs, skipping, rushed manual work). Logical and business-relevant. No inaccuracies, but slightly generic/repetitive (e.g., "adjusters prioritizing speed" overlaps causes).

- **SQL Verification Proposals (Weak-Middling, ~5/10)**: 
  | Issue | Severity | Impact |
  |-------|----------|--------|
  | **Cartesian product risk**: Simple JOIN on `claim_id` + activity filter assumes exactly 1 event per activity per claim. If multiples (possible per schema), explodes rows/duplicates times. No aggregation (e.g., `MIN/MAX(timestamp)` per activity/claim). **Major logical flaw**. | High | Queries unreliable in real data. |
  | **No correlation queries**: Prompt explicitly requires queries to "Correlate... with particular adjusters, claim types, or resources" and "checking if these patterns align with particular customer or region segments." Provides none—just basic time filters + vague "can be further refined." **Major omission**. | High | Fails core task 3 bullet. |
  | **Incomplete anomaly verification**: A-C anomaly hinges on "without... Evaluate or Approve consistently"—queries ignore missing intermediates (needs `NOT EXISTS` for E/P between A-C). E-N detects short but doesn't probe skipping. P-N extremes arbitrary/not tied to STDEV (e.g., ±2). | Medium-High | Logical gaps; doesn't fully "verify" skipping/prematurity. |
  | **Calculation inaccuracy**: P-N query `<300000` sec (~3.47 days) but comment says "<5 days" (should be ~432k sec). | Minor | Misleads reader. |
  | **Syntax/Usability**: PostgreSQL-correct (EPOCH good). Outputs useful (claim_id, minutes). Thresholds reasonable approximations. | N/A | Fine. |

- **Overall Structure/Presentation (~9/10)**: Clean, independent sections. No instruction references. Concise purposes. Flows logically.

**Total**: Penalized heavily for SQL flaws/omissions (core task). 7.2 reflects "good effort, covers basics accurately but critically flawed on verification rigor/completeness." Not "nearly flawless."
