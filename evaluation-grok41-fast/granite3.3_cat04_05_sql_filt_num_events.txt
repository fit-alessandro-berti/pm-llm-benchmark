**9.0**

The SQL query is logically flawless, efficient, and precisely meets the requirements: it correctly uses a CTE to group by `case_id`, aggregates with `COUNT(*)`, applies `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to retain only qualifying cases, and then returns all columns (`*`) for events in those cases via `IN`. This handles the task accurately without unnecessary complexity, works in DuckDB (standard SQL), and preserves the full event rows for valid cases.

However, the accompanying explanation contains a clear factual inaccuracy: it incorrectly describes `COUNT(*)` as a "window function." `COUNT(*)` is an aggregate function used with `GROUP BY`, not a window function (which requires `OVER()` and operates differently, e.g., for running totals). This is a non-trivial terminology error in a technical explanation, warranting a deduction despite the query's perfection. No other issues (e.g., performance, syntax, or edge cases like empty tables). Nearly flawless, but not quite due to this.
