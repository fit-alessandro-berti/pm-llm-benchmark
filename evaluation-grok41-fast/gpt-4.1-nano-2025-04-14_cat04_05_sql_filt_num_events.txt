The provided answer is flawless. The SQL query precisely meets the requirements: it correctly groups by `case_id` to count events per case, filters to retain only those with `event_count <= 6` (accurately excluding >6), and returns the full set of events (`el.*`) for the valid cases via a clean INNER JOIN. CTEs are appropriately used for clarity and efficiency in DuckDB (standard SQL compliance). No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities exist. The explanation is accurate, concise, and directly mirrors the query steps. The optional adaptability note is harmless and does not detract, as column names match the spec exactly. No deductions warranted under hypercritical scrutiny.
