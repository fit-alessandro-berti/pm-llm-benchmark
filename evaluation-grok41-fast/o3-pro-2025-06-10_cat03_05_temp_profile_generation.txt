**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (supporting high score):**
- **Format and Syntax (perfect, +2.0)**: Valid Python dictionary literal. Keys are immutable tuples of activity strings. Values are 2-tuples of integers (seconds). Underscores in numeric literals are Pythonic (3.6+). Comments are syntactically valid and enhance readability without breaking the code.
- **Content Coverage (excellent, +2.5)**: Representative subset (~28 pairs) with complexity as required—mixes direct (e.g., `('RC', 'QI')`), mid-range (e.g., `('QI', 'PT')`), and long-range (e.g., `('SS', 'AS')`) pairs. All 10 activities appear. Logical forward-ordering (no backward pairs like `('DT', 'SS')`). Includes rare/end activities like WS/AS.
- **Realism and Estimation (strong, +2.0)**: Times align with supply chain logic (e.g., OP-RC ~2 weeks lead time; RC-QI quick; WS-DT batch wait; DT-AS ~1 month). Totals scale sensibly (SS-AS ~2 months end-to-end). Stdevs are plausible (~10-25% of avg, escalating with distance).
- **Precision and Documentation (strong, +1.5)**: Exact second calculations (e.g., 16 days = 1_382_400 verified). Comments convert to days/hours with accurate ± interpretations. Intro text clarifies units/context, matching "illustrative" need. Explicitly notes approximations.
- **Structure (excellent, +1.2)**: Grouped by starting activity for clarity/traceability, fulfilling "ensuring complexity".

**Flaws/Deductions (strict, -0.8 total):**
- **Logical Inconsistency in Additivity (-0.5, significant but not fatal)**: In assumed sequential process (SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS), transitive avgs should approximately add (over traces). Mostly does (e.g., SSOP 2d + OPRC 14d = SSRC 16d ; OPCA 15.5d + CAPT 2d = OPPT 17.5d ). But lapses: CADT (8.5d) < CAPT (2d) + PTDT (7.5d) = 9.5d *or* CAPK (2.5d) + PKDT (7.2d) = 9.7d. Implies implausible path skips/variability not justified in prompt. Minor elsewhere (e.g., PTDT 7.5d  PTPK 0.5d + PKDT 7.2d). Harms "temporal profile" model fidelity—strict deduction.
- **Minor Completeness Gaps (-0.2)**: Representative but omits some expected pairs (e.g., `('RC', 'PK')`, `('QI', 'DT')`, `('CA', 'AS')`, `('PK', 'AS')`). Not required ("subset"), but hypercritically reduces exhaustiveness.
- **Unclarity/Over-illustration (-0.1)**: Extra prose ("intentionally approximate...") is helpful but exceeds "Produce a Python dictionary" (pure output preferred). Whitespace/comment density slightly bloats.

**Overall**: Nearly flawless (95%+ ideal)—comprehensive, realistic, well-executed. Single logical hiccup prevents 10.0; hyperstrictness demands deduction. Equivalent to A- in academic grading.
