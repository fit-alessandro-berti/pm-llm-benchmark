**9.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (near-flawless aspects)**:
  - Code is syntactically correct, uses pm4py correctly (Places, Transitions with name/label, petri_utils.add_arc_from_to, set updates, Markings).
  - Structure is clear with comments, logical place names ("p_after_X" for states between activities, standard in Petri nets/process mining).
  - Captures **linear sequence perfectly**: C  CR  DV  FC  CA  AP  P  N  CL.
  - **Loops modeled accurately and idiomatically**:
    - DV-RDS: Choice at `p_after_DV` (RDS  back to `p_doc_ready`  DV), enables 0+ iterations then proceed to FC. Matches "re-submission ... before the process continues."
    - FC-II: Choice at `p_after_FC` (II self-loops), enables 0+ II after single FC before CA. Matches "additional II ... multiple times before proceeding."
  - Token flow sound: Single token from `im[p_start]=1` reaches `fm[p_end]=1` via main path/loops; no deadlocks in accepting sense (reachable).
  - All activities included (C, CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL) with correct labels.
  - Extra print/debug and summary text are helpful, not harmful.

- **Minor Inaccuracies/Unclarities (deduct 0.5 total)**:
  - t_C ("Insurance Claim") included as internal transition, but scenario phrases as external customer action ("A customer files ... after which steps take place"). Minor over-modeling; could start at p_start  CR (deduct 0.3).
  - Transition labels use short descriptive phrases (e.g., "Insurance Claim" vs. full "Insurance Claim (C)"), but functional (pm4py uses label for semantics).

- **Logical Flaws (deduct 0.3 total)**:
  - AP modeled as **mandatory** (CA  AP  P always). Scenario explicitly conditional ("must be approved ... *if* the amount surpasses a certain threshold"), implying optional bypass (e.g., CA  choice  P or AP  P). No choice/invisible skip modeled, violating "logical sequence" for conditionals (deduct 0.3). Not fatal (sequential listing), but hypercritically inaccurate.

- **Why not 10.0?** Not "nearly flawless"—AP condition ignored (clear textual "if"), C slightly extraneous. No syntax/logic errors preventing run/acceptance, no missing arcs/places, loops precise to prompt ("between DV and RDS", "between FC and II"—II loop is "between" FC/CA effectively).
- **Why not lower?** Core requirements (accepting net, im/fm, loops, sequence) 100% met; runs to spec; no broken flows/dead places. Hypercritical but fair—excellent solution.
