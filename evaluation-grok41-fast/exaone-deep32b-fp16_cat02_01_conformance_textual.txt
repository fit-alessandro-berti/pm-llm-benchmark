The answer is flawless in identifying the exact violating cases (2, 3, 5) and non-violating cases (1, 4). Explanations are precise, directly reference the normative rules (e.g., order constraints, branching after Check, post-Cancel prohibitions), correctly interpret path exclusivity implied by inventory outcomes, and accurately describe each violation without overreach or omission. No logical flaws, ambiguities, or inaccuracies; phrasing is clear and structures analysis effectively.
