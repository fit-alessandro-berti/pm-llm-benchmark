**10.0**

This query is correct, efficient, and precisely fulfills the requirements without any inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. It accurately groups by `case_id`, applies the `HAVING` filter for `COUNT(*) <= 6` (correctly excluding >6 events), and returns the full event rows (`SELECT *`) only for qualifying cases via a standard `IN` subquery. No unnecessary clauses, no assumptions beyond the schema, fully compatible with DuckDB, and optimally simple. No deductions warranted.
