**7.2**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: Correctly identifies exactly three cases based on unique patient_age + patient_gender combinations (no over- or under-splitting). All listed events are accurately assigned with no misgroupings (e.g., no cross-contamination between patients). Logical flow reasoning is sound (registration  triage/diagnostics  consult/treatment  discharge). Temporal ordering within groups is strictly increasing and preserved. All 16/18 events are covered correctly; nice tabular + list format for clarity; comprehensive derivation explanation.
- **Fatal flaws (strict deductions)**: 
  - **Incompleteness (major inaccuracy)**: Omits **event 12** (Doctor consultation, ER, 45M at 08:23:10Z, diagnosis=hairline_fracture — logically follows X-ray on left_leg for Case1, precedes discharge). Omits **event 10** (Lab test completed, Laboratory, 62F at 08:20:27Z — logically follows lab request for Case2, precedes consult). Not all events grouped; claims "these three collections represent the three distinct patient journeys" is false.
  - **Factual error**: States "45M appears only in events1,4,7,15" and "62F appears only in events2,5,8,11,14,17" — directly wrong (ignores 12 and 10). Undermines core reasoning premise.
  - **Logical flaws**: Case1 flow illogical without consult (X-ray  immediate discharge skips diagnosis). Case2 skips lab completion (request  consult without result). Department labels imprecise (e.g., Case2 "ER (lab)" ignores event 10's Laboratory dept).
  - **Minor issues**: Table omits commas in event lists (e.g., "1  4  7  15"); Case1 depts miss ER consult; no explicit chronological reordering confirmation beyond claim.
- **Why not lower?** 89% event coverage, zero wrong assignments, perfect case count/demographics/dept progression insight — not random or grossly wrong. Why not higher? Not "nearly flawless" (incomplete coverage + explicit false claims = disqualifying for 9+). Deducted ~2.8 points total for two major omissions + errors.
