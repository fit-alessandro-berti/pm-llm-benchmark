The response delivers precisely 20 distinct, open-ended questions ("How" and "What" starters) that directly probe insights, issues (e.g., risks, compliance gaps), improvements (e.g., contract redesigns, customs strategies), and implications (e.g., trade-offs, reputational risks) across the supply chain stages (R&D/suppliers, manufacturing, logistics/distribution, post-sales, tech/sustainability). All accurately reflect described elements (e.g., Taiwan microprocessors, Malaysia shifts, JIT, ML forecasting, carbon footprint, recalls) without inaccuracies, introducing logical extensions (e.g., circular economy, blockchain) that are inferentially valid and thought-provoking. No SQL or unrelated content. Formatting with bold titles enhances clarity without detracting. Sole minor deduction for the unprompted closing summary sentence, which slightly exceeds "just list the questions," but does not introduce flaws.
