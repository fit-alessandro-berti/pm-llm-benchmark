The final answer provides a correct, efficient, and standard SQL query using an uncorrelated IN subquery that precisely meets the requirements: it identifies `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via GROUP BY and HAVING, then returns all events from those `case_id`s. The approach and explanation are clear, accurate, and directly address the task without extraneous details, ambiguities, or errors. No logical flaws, performance issues (valid for DuckDB), or deviations from the spec.
