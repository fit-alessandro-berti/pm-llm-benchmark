**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This is an excellent response overall—comprehensive, well-structured, and tightly aligned with the prompt's goals. It produces a focused list of 15 targeted, open-ended questions that systematically probe missing details (e.g., Q1, Q5), decision criteria (e.g., Q2, Q4, Q10), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q3), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q1, Q6, Q11), and exceptions (e.g., Q7, Q8). No SQL queries or implementation details are requested; all stay conceptual. Questions are clear, non-leading, and build logically on the process description without redundancy or irrelevance. Coverage is thorough, addressing stakeholders, bottlenecks, communication, and audits.

**Minor deductions (strictly applied, preventing a perfect 10):**
- **Q13 (0.4 deduction)**: Slight logical overreach. The prompt focuses on *onboarding process* clarification (up to audits/activation/move-in). This question shifts to *post-onboarding* issues ("after the onboarding is complete"), introducing accountability/resolution outside the described lifecycle. While tangentially related ("throughout the entire lifecycle"), it's not core to "deepen your conceptual understanding of the process" and risks diluting focus.
- **Q12 & Q1 (0.2 deduction each, total 0.4)**: Borderline on "implementation details." Q12 asks how communication is "managed and tracked through your internal processes or systems" (description already names CRMs/tools); Q1 specifies "system for following up." These probe *how* (conceptual) but edge toward tool mechanics, potentially eliciting specifics banned by the prompt. Still conceptual overall, but hypercritically imprecise phrasing.
- **Q15 (0.2 deduction)**: Valuable for improvement but not directly tied to prompt's explicit aims (missing details, decisions, roles, timing, *exceptions*). It's meta-evaluative (KPIs for "effectiveness"), which broadens beyond "clarify and improve your understanding of their process" into process optimization—minor scope creep.

No inaccuracies, unclarities, or major flaws; 92% perfection justifies 9.2 (very high but not "nearly flawless" under utmost strictness). A 10 would require zero such nits.
