The provided answer is nearly flawless. The SQL query precisely achieves the required outcome: it accurately computes event counts per `case_id` via a CTE, joins back to `event_log` to retrieve all events (`e.*`), and filters correctly with `WHERE c.event_count <= 6` to exclude cases with more than six events while returning the full set of events for qualifying cases. This works correctly in DuckDB (standard SQL features fully supported), handles all rows appropriately without data loss for good cases, and scales well.

The explanation is clear, structured, and mirrors the query logic without extraneous details or errors. No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, inefficiencies, or logical flaws exist—even under hypercritical scrutiny. Alternative approaches (e.g., window functions or `HAVING` in the CTE) are possible but unnecessary; this is optimal, readable, and directly matches the prompt.
