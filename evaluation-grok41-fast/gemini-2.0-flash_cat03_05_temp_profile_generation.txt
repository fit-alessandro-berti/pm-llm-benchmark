**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (supporting the score):**
- **Format perfection (full credit)**: Valid Python dictionary syntax. Keys are immutable tuples of activity labels (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`). Values are tuples of two positive floats/ints representing `(average_time, standard_deviation)` in seconds. Includes explanatory comments aligning with supply chain logic (e.g., longer std devs for procurement).
- **Realistic individual estimates (strong)**: Times scale logically with supply chain phases—short for internal ops (hours: selection, inspection, assembly/testing/packaging), medium for logistics (days: receive, storage/distribution), long for lifecycle (30+ days: after-sales). Seconds-based (e.g., 86400=1 day, 3600=1 hour). Std devs are plausible (~25-50% of avg, higher absolute for longer intervals).
- **Coverage & complexity (good, not great)**: 15 pairs out of ~45 possible forward pairs in a linear 10-activity trace. Includes direct (e.g., `RC->QI`), short-skip (e.g., `SS->RC`, `RC->CA`), and long-skip (e.g., `OP->AS`, `DT->AS`) for "multi-step" complexity. Spans all 10 activities. Representative subset per prompt.
- **Additive consistency in some chains (partial credit)**: Perfect for `SS->RC == SS->OP + OP->RC` (172800 = 7200 + 165600). Roughly OK for others (e.g., `OP->QI  OP->RC + RC->QI`, diff 2h negligible).

**Fatal Flaws (major deductions: -2.0 total)**:
- **Non-additive averages (core logical impossibility, -1.5)**: In sequential traces (implied by linear process order), `avg(A,C) = avg(A,B) + avg(B,C)` *must* hold exactly for every trace prefix. Violations prove incoherent model:
  | Chain | Provided Sum | Direct Avg | Diff (seconds/days) |
  |-------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
  | SSRCCA | 172800 + 86400 = 259200 (~3d) | 345600 (4d) | +86400 (+1d) |
  | RCQICA | 3600 + 72000 = 75600 (~21h) | 86400 (1d) | +10800 (+3h) |
  | CAPTPK | 28800 + 7200 = 36000 (~10h) | 43200 (12h) | +7200 (+2h) |
  - Systematic overestimate for skips (> path sum) implies impossible negative sub-interval times in some traces. Undermines entire temporal profile concept. Not "estimation error"—mathematical contradiction.
- **Incomplete chain coverage (minor but strict, -0.5)**: No pairs for key skips (e.g., `QIPT/WS/DT/AS`, `PTWS/DT/AS`, `CAWS/DT/AS`, `SSAS`, `SSQI/PT/PK`). Subset is front-heavy (procurement/early mfg); underrepresents back-half complexity despite "ensuring complexity."

**Minor Issues (deduct -0.3 total)**:
- Extraneous `print(temporal_profile)`: Not requested; bloats output (prompt example is pure dict).
- Unbalanced std devs: Reasonable relatively, but e.g., `OP->AS` std (95040011d) > `DT->AS` (864000=10d) despite shorter path—illogical variance growth.
- No evidence of variance formula (e.g., STDEV propagation), but unrequired.

**Overall**: Strong format/estimates/coverage, but logical flaws make it unreliable for "temporal profile" use (deviations/ZETA meaningless if base avgs incoherent). 10.0 requires *zero* issues; this is solid mid-tier (not minimal 1.0 garbage). Strict deduction yields 7.2—not "nearly flawless."
