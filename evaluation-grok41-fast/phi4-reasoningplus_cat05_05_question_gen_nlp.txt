The provided answer is a precise, numbered list of exactly 20 distinct, thought-provoking, open-ended questions that directly align with the process description. Each question probes insights (e.g., data analytics in Q7), potential issues (e.g., delays in Q5, Q8, Q19; cyber threats in Q18), strategies for improvement (e.g., risk mitigation in Q1, Q12; continuous improvement in Q10), and decision implications (e.g., balancing costs/JIT in Q14; regulatory compliance in Q4, Q9). All reference specific elements from the description (e.g., international suppliers/countries in Q1, Q19; JIT in Q5; 24/7 Malaysia in Q6; digital systems in Q3, Q17, Q18; recalls/warranty in Q9; carbon footprint in Q10, Q15). No SQL queries, no extraneous text, fully clear, logically sound, and free of inaccuracies, repetitions beyond acceptable thematic variety, or unclarities.
