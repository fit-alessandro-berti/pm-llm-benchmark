**9.8/10.0**

### Grading Rationale
- **Accuracy (3.0/3.0)**: Near-perfect match to the diagram. Correctly identifies all major nodes (e.g., "Customer Portal", "Check Cart", "Valid Cart?", "Submit Order", "Order Exchange", "Place Order", "Payment Required?", "Payment Gateway with Customer", "Check Payment", "Payment OK?", "Payment Failed", "Ship Order"), swimlanes, flows, decisions, loops, and end events. Minor nit: No explicit "Fulfill Order?" or "Inventory" diamond visible (possibly inferred from paths), and "Delivery Status" isn't labeled but aligns with the flow to the final oval.
- **Completeness (2.5/2.5)**: Covers layout, symbols, legend, cross-swimlane handoffs, happy path, error paths, and overall process summary. Includes extras like visual style and BPMN-style notation.
- **Clarity & Structure (2.0/2.0)**: Exceptionally well-organized (swimlanes, numbered steps, bullets, summary). Readable, professional, and concise yet detailed.
- **Depth & Insight (2.3/2.5)**: Excellent breakdown, process summary, and context (e.g., secure workflow emphasis). Offers refinement option—value-add.

**Why not 10.0?** Tiny assumptions (e.g., "Delivery Status", "Order Failed" end state) slightly extrapolate beyond exact labels, but they're negligible for such a high-quality analysis. This is publication-ready.
