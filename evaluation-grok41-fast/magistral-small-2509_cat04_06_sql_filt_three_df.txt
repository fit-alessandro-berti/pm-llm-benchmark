**10.0**

The provided SQL query is correct, complete, and precisely meets all requirements. It accurately identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence using row numbers and joins, correctly filters those sequences by the >5-day interval between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' (valid DuckDB syntax with timestamp-interval comparison), excludes entire cases via `NOT IN` on distinct bad case IDs (handling multiples correctly), and returns all events from remaining cases with appropriate ordering. No inaccuracies, inefficiencies impacting correctness, ambiguities, or logical flaws; handles edge cases like multiple sequences per case or non-consecutive events as required. Fully compliant and optimal.
