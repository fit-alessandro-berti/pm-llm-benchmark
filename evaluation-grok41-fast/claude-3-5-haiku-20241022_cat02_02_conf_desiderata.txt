**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This grade reflects a strong overall structure and coverage of ~80% of the task requirements, with accurate identification of most key issues, but significant deductions for **major inaccuracies** (missed normative violation), **incompleteness** (task 3 weakly addressed), minor logical flaws/unclarities, and extraneous content. Under utmost strictness, these prevent a "nearly flawless" score (9+ requires zero substantive gaps). Breakdown by task:

#### Task 1: Normative Violations (Partial: ~7/10)
- **Strengths**: Correctly flags Case 2 as violating (only case with normative issues); accurately explains *two* violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize after Rejection). Case 1 and 3 correctly cleared (sequence perfect despite delays).
- **Major Inaccuracies/Flaws** (heavy deduction):
  - **Misses complete skip of "Inform Applicant" in Case 2**: Log shows Decision (Rejected) at 09:30  Finalize  Close, with *no Inform at all*. This is a **clear normative violation** ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed"; "no skipping steps"; sequence mandates Decision  Inform  [branch]  Close). Closing without informing is explicitly disallowed ("Closing the case without following the decision logic"). This is as severe as the caught issues—**critical omission**, inflating Case 2's violation count from 2 to at least 3.
  - No mention of Case 2's Decision occurring without proper prior sequence (Risk pre-Credit invalidates "based on this assessment" post-Credit).
- **Minor Issues**: Phrasing like "CRITICAL violations" adds unasked emphasis; good but not hyper-precise on "contradictory actions."

#### Task 2: Desiderata Failures (Strong: ~9/10)
- **Strengths**: Correctly flags only Case 3 (delays >24h Credit, >48h Inform; no Follow-up). Clarifies as "not severe" via "Operational Inefficiencies"/"improvement opportunities"/"suboptimal" language. Ignores Case 1/2 appropriately (timely where applicable; Case 2's "don't seem to apply" is logical given critical breaches).
- **Minor Flaw**: Imprecise timings (e.g., Case 3 Inform as "4 days" vs. exact ~3 days/3h from Decision; Credit "2 days" fine). No flag for potential Case 1 Follow-up absence (log silent, but Case 3 explicitly notes—consistent but assumptive).

#### Task 3: Interpretations/Justifications (Weak: ~5/10)
- **Strengths**: Provides "Detailed Analysis" section attempting interpretations (e.g., Case 1 "ideal"; Case 3 "sluggishness"; Case 2 "systemic issues").
- **Flaws** (heavy deduction):
  - **Not "in line with constraints/recommendations"**: Offers critiques/recommendations (e.g., "training," "automated systems") instead of *justifications* for behaviors (e.g., for Case 3 delays: "possibly due to weekends/holidays between Jan12-14"; for Case 2: no attempt to interpret skips/orders, just blame). Task seeks "interpretations or justifications... in line with given constraints" (e.g., rationalizing desiderata as non-severe), not new advice.
  - Vague/superficial (e.g., Case 2 "potential systemic issues" doesn't tie to log/constraints).

#### Overall Structure/Style (Good: ~8/10)
- Clear sections, tabular-friendly summary, "Key Takeaways."
- **Flaws**: Extraneous/unasked content ("Recommendations," broad takeaways) dilutes focus (~20% bloat). Minor unclarities (e.g., Case 2 desiderata dismissal "don't seem to apply" is handwavy, not explained).

**Net**: Excellent intent/organization lifts from low-6s, but missed core violation + weak Task 3 = decisive flaws. Flawless answer would exhaustively list *all* Case 2 violations, precisely time desiderata, justify behaviors (e.g., "Case 3 delays tolerable as desiderata only"), and stick to tasks—no extras.
