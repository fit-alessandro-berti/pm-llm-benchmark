**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless: it precisely identifies the +10 CommunityGroup adjustment as the core bias mechanism (favoring Highland Civic Darts Club members in C001/C004), supports claims with accurate case comparisons (e.g., C003's 715 rejection vs. C004's 700 approval), correctly notes compounding LocalResident effects without overclaiming, elucidates equity implications for non-affiliated/non-local applicants with similar creditworthiness, and maintains logical consistency throughout. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws; all conclusions are evidence-driven and directly responsive.
