**8.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (why not lower):** 
  - Perfectly covers all 15 events with exhaustive grouping and no omissions/overlaps.
  - Labels are intuitive and directly match prompt examples ("Cutting Metal," "Assembling Parts," "Welding," "Quality Inspection").
  - Rationales are detailed, sensor-specific, and logically tied to manufacturing intuition (e.g., vibration/flow for cutting, temp spike/zero flow for welding). Transitions form a coherent process flow.
  - Excellent structure: Clear sections, patterns tabulated per phase, summary table, overall process summary. Demonstrates true process mining insight.
  - No factual misreads of data (e.g., correctly notes temp drops, tool positions).

- **Flaws (strict penalties applied):**
  - **Grouping inaccuracy (#10-12 as one phase):** Patterns are not consistently "related" or "distinct"—#10 (flow=0, vib=1Hz, tool=15mm, temp=30°C) is pure cooldown (dissimilar to #11-12's flow=1, vib=5Hz, tool=20mm). Merging dilutes phase purity; ideal would separate "Cooling" (#10) and "Inspection" (#11-12). Logical but not precise.
  - **Factual error in summary table:** Inspection row claims "Flow = 1 unit/s" for #10–#12, but #10 is 0 units/s. This misgeneralizes, undermining table reliability despite correct per-event details.
  - **Minor naming inconsistency:** Phase header "Quality Inspection & Cooling," table/rationales simplify to "Quality Inspection," creating slight unclarity.
  - **Underuse of pressure:** Rarely cited (e.g., jumps to 2 bar in #7-9 for assembly/welding), missing chance to strengthen rationales (e.g., pressure for clamping).
  - **Redundant phases:** Two near-identical "Idle" phases (1-3, 13-15) are fine but could be noted as cycle bookends without separate numbering/rationale repetition.

Nearly flawless execution elevates to 8.0; these issues (especially table error and grouping) prevent 9+. Flawless would require pixel-perfect consistency, no generalizations errors, tighter phases.
