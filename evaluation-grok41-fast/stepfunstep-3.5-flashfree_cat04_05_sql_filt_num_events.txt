**9.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Correctness of primary query (IN subquery)**: Flawless. Exactly matches requirements: correctly groups by `case_id`, uses `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to identify valid cases (inclusive of exactly 6, excludes >6), returns *all original columns* (`SELECT * FROM event_log`) for only those cases, no extras added, preserves full event rows. Works perfectly in DuckDB, handles edge cases (e.g., 0 events, duplicate case_ids handled by GROUP BY). +10/10 here.
- **Explanation**: Thorough, accurate, step-by-step, verifies logic with "Why this works correctly" (grouping, filtering, output columns). Minor plus for readability aids like numbered steps. No logical flaws.
- **Major deduction (-1.0 total)**: 
  - **Alternative window function query inaccuracy**: Presented as "**also valid**" and "Both approaches are valid", but it **fails** the requirement to "return only the events" / "full set of events". `SELECT *` on the subquery **adds an extra column** (`case_event_count`) to every row, altering the output schema (original columns + new one). Prompt implies original event data unchanged; this augments it. No fix provided (e.g., no `EXCEPT`, no explicit column list since columns unknown beyond "at least" three). DuckDB-specific features like `EXCEPT` aren't used/relied on. This is a logical flaw and misleading claim of validity.
- **Minor deductions (-0.0 net, but noted for strictness)**:
  - Provides **two queries + explanation** when prompt asks for "**a** DuckDB SQL query". Extraneous content; benchmark likely expects concise single query.
  - Window suggestion "preferable if you need the event counts" acknowledges addition indirectly but doesn't mitigate the schema mismatch.
  - No performance caveats in final answer (e.g., IN vs. window efficiency), though <think> considered them—irrelevant since not output.
- **Overall**: Primary solution perfect, explanation strong, but alternative's inaccuracy + extras prevent 10.0 ("nearly flawless"). 9.0 reflects excellence with one clear logical/presentation flaw under hypercritical lens.
