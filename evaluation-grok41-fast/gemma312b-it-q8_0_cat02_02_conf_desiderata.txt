**3.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation:
This answer is structured well (clear sections, table, interpretations) and correctly identifies Case 2's two explicit normative violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection), while accurately clearing Cases 1 and 3 of normative issues. It addresses desiderata with clarification of suboptimality and provides justifications/interpretations as required (Task 3). The summary table and overall assessment are helpful additions.

However, under utmost strictness, **major flaws prevent a higher score**:

1. **Critical omission in normative violations (Task 1)**: Case 2 completely skips "Inform Applicant" (mandatory after Loan Decision, per sequence: "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision"; "no skipping activities"). Log shows Decision (09:30)  Finalize (10:00)  Close (10:30), with no Inform anywhere. This is a clear, severe violation ("Skipping activities in the required sequence" explicitly not allowed). Missing this makes the analysis incomplete—Case 2 has *at least* three normative violations, not two. Logical flaw: Claims "significant violation" but underreports.

2. **Inaccuracy in desiderata (Task 2)**: Falsely claims Case 2's Credit Check violates 24-hour preference (08:00 Received  09:00 Credit Check = ~1 hour, fully compliant). This is a factual error with no basis in log, introducing unneeded "suboptimal" flag. Inconsistency: Notes desiderata only for Cases 2/3 but ignores uniform lack of Follow-up Call across *all* cases (encouraged pre-Close); selectively flags Case 3 but not 1/2, muddying completeness.

3. **Minor unclarities/logical gaps**:
   - Lists Case 2 normative violations separately without consolidating (repetitive "* Case 2: Another..." feels disjointed).
   - Interpretations are generic ("system error, misunderstanding") and not always "in line with constraints" (e.g., can't justify order reversal or post-reject finalize without violating strict rules; Task 3 says "when possible").
   - No explicit confirmation Case 1 is flawless (timings perfect, all steps present), though implied.
   - Table omits missed Inform violation, perpetuating error.
   - Case 2's missing Inform also implies desiderata failure (not "promptly informed"—never informed), unaddressed.

These are not minor: Omission of mandatory step is a *core* analytical failure; factual error undermines credibility. ~70% accurate but critically flawed = mid-low score. Flawless would fully list all violations/desiderata deviations, zero errors, precise justifications. Deduct heavily per instructions.
