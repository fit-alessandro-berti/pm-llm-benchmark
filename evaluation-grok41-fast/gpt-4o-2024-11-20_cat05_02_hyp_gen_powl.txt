**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Base Score)**:
  - **Structure and Completeness**: Perfectly mirrors the task's 3 steps. Anomalies precisely identified (loop redundancy, skippable XOR, partial order flaws like AC bypassing loop/xor—directly from code). Hypotheses creative yet grounded (e.g., business changes, miscomm, tech errors, validation lacks—aligns with prompt examples). Queries target exact examples given (closed w/o eval/approval, multiple approvals, skipped N) + extra for premature.
  - **Anomaly ID (10/10)**: Flawless, concise, explains impacts (efficiency, compliance, out-of-order).
  - **Hypotheses (9.5/10)**: Strong, varied, realistic. Minor: Slightly generic (#4 overlaps #3), but no flaws.
  - **Queries Overall (8/10)**: 3/5 solid. 3.1 correct (handles multiples via DISTINCT + LEFT JOIN logic; catches missing E *OR* P accurately). 3.2 perfect (GROUP BY detects loops). 3.3 aggregate perfect (% skipped); first query functional (multi-N  all 'Notified', consistent). Step 4 adds value (implications/next steps) without bloat.
  - Clarity/Logic: Crisp, professional. No unclarities.

- **Deduction Triggers (Strict -2.8 total)**:
  - **Major Flaw in 3.4 (-1.5)**: Logically incorrect for "premature C". LEFT JOIN on multi-row E/P creates cartesian product; condition `C.timestamp < COALESCE(ce_eval.timestamp, future)` falsely positives if *any* late E/P exists post-C, even if early E/P pre-C occurred (e.g., E1 t1<C, E2 t2>C  row2 passes `C < t2`, detects erroneously despite prior eval). Ignores intent: check *no E/P before C* (needs `NOT EXISTS(subq e.timestamp < C.timestamp)` or `MIN(e.timestamp) > C.timestamp`). Duplicates unhandled (no DISTINCT/GROUP). "Immediately after A" in text unmatched (no `ce_close > ce_assign`). COALESCE string '9999-12-31' sloppy (Postgres coerces but non-TIMESTAMP risks; use `timestamp '9999-12-31 23:59:59'`).
  - **Minor Flaws (-0.8)**: 3.3 first query dupes on multi-N (no DISTINCT). 3.1 text "without E *or* P" but comment says "no ... E or approve" (ambiguous phrasing). No adjuster joins (prompt mentions tables, but not required—still missed opportunity for specialization checks). Step 4 unasked (harmless but bloats).
  - **Nitpicks (-0.5)**: Hypotheses don't tie tightly to model (e.g., no XOR/partial-order specifics). No throughput/case counts in queries (e.g., aggregate anomalies/claim % everywhere for verification strength).

Nearly flawless (90%+ excellence), but SQL inaccuracy in core "premature" query (task-highlighted anomaly) prevents 9+. 8.2 reflects "very good, minor-to-major fixable issues."
