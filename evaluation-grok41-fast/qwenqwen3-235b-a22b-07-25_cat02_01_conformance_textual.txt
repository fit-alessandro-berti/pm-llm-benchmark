**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless. It correctly identifies exactly the violating cases (2, 3, and 5) with no misses or false positives (Cases 1 and 4 are properly cleared). Explanations are precise, directly reference the normative description's key phrases (e.g., "before packaging," "never after a cancellation," "after authorization and before shipping"), interpret branching logic and illogicals accurately (e.g., Case 3's post-authorization cancel as unsupported deviation), and highlight all relevant issues (ordering, missing steps, post-cancel fulfillment). Structure enhances clarity without errors; no inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical flaws in final conclusions. Hypercritical review finds zero penalizable issues.
