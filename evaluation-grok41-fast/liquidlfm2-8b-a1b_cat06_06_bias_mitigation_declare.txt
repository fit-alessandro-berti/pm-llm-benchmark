**Grade: 1.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
- **Invalid Python Syntax (Fatal Flaw):** Comments (e.g., `# --- NEW BIAS-MITIGATING CONSTRAINTS ---`) are embedded directly within the dictionary literal, rendering the code non-executable Python. This alone disqualifies it as "valid Python code."
- **Complete Deviation from DECLARE Format (Core Failure):** The prompt mandates strict adherence to predefined keys (e.g., `"coexistence"`, `"non_succession"`) with precise unary/binary nesting (e.g., `{"source": {"target": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}}`). The answer invents non-existent keys like `"coexistence_race_and_review"`, `"succession_with_nonsuccession_guard"`, and `"noncoexistence_race_and_decision_link"`, with arbitrary nested structures (`"depends_on"`, `"explains"`, `"unrestricted_succession"`). No additions use standard keys or correct nesting.
- **No Actual Bias-Mitigating DECLARE Constraints:** Fails to add real constraints (e.g., no population of `"non_succession": {"CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}}` or `"coexistence": {"Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": ...}}`). Custom inventions don't "limit the process’s bias" in DECLARE terms; they're meaningless.
- **Inconsistent/Non-Compliant Details:** Varies `"support"`/`"confidence"` (e.g., 0.9, 0.7) against prompt's uniform 1.0 example. Introduces unrelated activities (e.g., `"InitiateApplication"`, `"Response_Without_Immediate_Decision"`) without model integration. Ignores original activities like `"FinalDecision"`.
- **Rationale Mismatch and Verbosity:** Justifies fabricated constraints as if valid, ignoring instructions for "brief rationale for each added constraint" and "short explanation." Claims unproven benefits (e.g., "disallows blanket automated routing") without DECLARE semantics.
- **No Preservation of Original:** Pollutes the model with junk instead of cleanly extending standard empties (e.g., `"precedence": {}`, `"nonsuccession": {}`).

This is not an approximation—it's a total misunderstanding, warranting the minimum score. A passing answer must be syntactically valid, format-perfect, and semantically correct in DECLARE.
