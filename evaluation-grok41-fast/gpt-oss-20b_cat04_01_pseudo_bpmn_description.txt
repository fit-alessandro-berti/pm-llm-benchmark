**9.2**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (near-flawless coverage)**: The answer provides a **detailed, structured explanation** of the entire process, mapping every pseudo-BPMN element (tasks, gateways, events) to business purposes with real-world rationale (e.g., credit check prevents bad debt; feasibility analysis avoids wasted quoting). Gateways are accurately defined (XOR as exclusive single-path; AND as parallel split/join for speed). Paths are clearly differentiated (standard: validation + parallel checks + delivery calc; custom: feasibility + conditional quote/rejection). Convergence is precisely identified (post-D/E1 at "Approval Needed?" XOR). Loops are correctly described in text (H  E1 for custom/D for standard, with business logic like re-quoting or re-calculating due to changes). Conditions for approvals/rework are well-clarified (policy-based, e.g., value thresholds, risk; rework on denial). Summary table crisply contrasts standard/custom. Final steps (G/I/End) and early end (E2) handled perfectly. No major omissions; verbose but precise.
  
- **Minor Inaccuracies/Unclarities (deducting 0.8 total)**:
  - **Visual diagram logical flaw**: ASCII map misrepresents loop—arrows suggest H loops back into the post-approval G path or approval gateway itself (e.g., "G <-------- H <--- Loop Back ---" with circular arrow), implying intra-approval rework rather than *pre-approval* loop to E1/D (which requires re-entering approval afterward). Text corrects this accurately, but visual contradicts pseudo-BPMN and creates confusion for readers visualizing flow. Significant for a process explanation relying on diagrams.
  - **Task A omission**: Pseudo explicitly has "Task A: 'Receive Customer Request'" post-Start Event; answer merges it into Start Event label/table, slightly blurring event vs. activity distinction (minor structural inaccuracy).
  - **Speculative details**: €10k threshold, "hazardous materials," etc., are reasonable inferences but arbitrary/unsubstantiated (pseudo-BPMN unspecified); phrased as "typical" but presented as definitive examples, risking over-precision.
  - **Custom delivery calc assumption**: Table claims delivery "done only after quote approved (E1  G)," but pseudo-BPMN has no explicit D equivalent for custom (only standard path). Implicitly reasonable (in G?), but unclarified—minor gap vs. "how tasks differ."

- **No penalties for**: Clarity (tables/sections excellent), completeness (all paths/loops/convergences covered), no logical flaws in core text/conclusions, business depth exceeds requirement.

Overall: Exceptionally thorough and accurate (95%+ flawless), but visual/logical representation flaw + tiny omissions prevent 10.0 under hyper-strict criteria.
