The answer is nearly flawless. It comprehensively groups all low-level events from both sample cases into four coherent, logically sequential high-level steps without omissions, overlaps, or misassignments. Groupings align perfectly with temporal proximity (e.g., precise intra-group timing clusters), resource roles, logical dependencies (e.g., welding immediately verified before coating), and process phases, matching the prompt's criteria and examples. Rationales are precise, evidence-based (citing times, resources, workflows), and domain-relevant. Names are concise, meaningful, and manufacturing-appropriate (e.g., "Protective Coating & Curing" aptly captures application+drying). Output strictly follows the structured format, with a summary reinforcing grouping logic. No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or flaws—even minor ones like inconsistent terminology or unsubstantiated claims are absent. Consistent across cases A1/B2.
