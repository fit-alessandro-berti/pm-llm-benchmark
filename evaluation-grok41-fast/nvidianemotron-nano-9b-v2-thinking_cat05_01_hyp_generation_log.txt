**7.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting the score)**:
  - Anomalies correctly identified for 1002 (credit check after shipment steps, early attempt flag), 1003 (ship before confirm, late flag), and 1004 (payment before invoice). Matches data precisely.
  - Hypotheses are relevant and varied (system errors, policy violations, fraud, resource issues), directly tied to anomalies.
  - SQL queries are mostly well-structured, PostgreSQL-compatible (e.g., EXISTS subqueries, LIKE, LAG window function), focused on `order_event_log` (no unnecessary joins), and propose investigation without hints.
  - Query 1: Useful baseline for sequences.
  - Query 3: Logically correct for detecting late credit checks (flags 1002).
  - Query 4: Correctly targets flags (flags 1002/1003).
  - Query 5: Sophisticated, detects short gaps (e.g., 1004's 5-min register-to-payment).
  - Clear structure, expected results stated, next steps logical.
  - No adult/offensive content issues; follows schema.

- **Critical Flaws (preventing higher score)**:
  - **Major logical error in Query 2**: SQL detects *normal* cases (invoice *before* payment via `timestamp <`), not anomalies (payment *before* invoice). For 1004 (payment 09:05, invoice 09:20), EXISTS fails (`09:20  09:05`), so it won't flag as claimed ("Expected Result: Case 1004"). This inverts the purpose, undermining a core anomaly. Fatal inaccuracy in "final conclusions."
  - Misses key anomalies: 
    - Missing activities (e.g., no `Validate Stock` in 1003/1004; no `Credit Check` in 1004). No query for absent steps (e.g., cases with `Ship Goods` but no prior `Validate Stock`).
    - 1004's `shipment_scheduled=N` but `Ship Goods` anyway (conflicting flags/states). No query (Query 4's LIKE misses `shipment_scheduled=N`).
    - 1003's `Issue Invoice` before `Confirm Shipment` (deviates from flow).
  - Query 1 too generic (dumps all events; lacks filters for anomalies).
  - No queries leverage `orders`/`resources` (e.g., anomalies by `order_type=priority` in 1002, or role mismatches), despite "possibly" allowed.
  - Minor unclarities: Hypotheses generic ("system error"); no quantification (e.g., time thresholds for "unusually short"); Query 5 filters limit scope (misses gaps to/from unlisted activities).

- **Overall**: Strong anomaly spotting/hypotheses (8-9 range), solid most-queries (8 range), but SQL bug + missed anomalies + gaps = significant deductions. Not "nearly flawless" (requires 9.5+). Strict penalty for flawed core output.
