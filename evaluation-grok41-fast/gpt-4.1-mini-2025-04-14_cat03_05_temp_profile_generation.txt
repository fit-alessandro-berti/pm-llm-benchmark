**7.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**:
  - Valid Python syntax overall (dict literal with tuples of numeric values for most entries).
  - Covers a representative subset (~30 pairs) spanning direct successors, non-consecutive, and long-range, adding complexity as required (e.g., ('SS','DT'), ('QI','AS')).
  - Realistic estimates for high-tech supply chain: short internal steps (hours), procurement/receiving (days), storage/distribution (days), after-sales (weeks/months). Uses seconds consistently via 3600 multiples.
  - Logical linear sequence assumed (SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS), matching scenario description.
  - Comments aid clarity (though not required) and show estimation rationale.

- **Fatal Flaws (major deductions)**:
  - **Invalid entry `('DT', 'WS'): (None, None)`**: Breaks core definition—pairs must "eventually follow each other in at least one process execution." WS precedes DT in the sequence; DT never precedes WS. Including a non-occurring pair contradicts the task. `(None, None)` is not numeric (prompt requires `(average_time, standard_deviation)` as numbers; example uses floats/ints). This renders the dict unusable for ZETA deviation checks (e.g., `AVG - ZETA * STDEV` fails on None). Contradicts comment "# Skipped or illogical pairs are omitted." (-1.5 points).
  - **Logical inconsistency**: Comment admits DT does not precede WS, yet includes it—self-contradictory.

- **Inaccuracies & Logical Flaws (significant deductions)**:
  - **Inconsistent time summations**: Longer-pair avgs don't precisely aggregate direct predecessors, showing sloppy estimation:
    | Pair | Provided Avg (approx days/h) | Expected Sum (from directs) | Discrepancy |
    |------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
    | ('RC','PT') | 2d + 8h (~2.3d) | RC-QI(6h)+QI-CA(8h)+CA-PT(1d) = ~1.6d | Under by ~0.7d |
    | ('OP','PT') | 6d + 8h (~6.3d) | OP-RC(5d)+RC-QI(6h)+QI-CA(8h)+CA-PT(1d) = ~6.6d | Minor, but off |
    | ('SS','PT') | 6d + 10h (~6.4d) | SS-OP(2h)+...+CA-PT(1d) = ~6.7d | Minor, but pattern of approximation errors |
    Stdevs are arbitrary/hand-wavy (e.g., not (sum vars) for independents; sometimes > proportional to distance). (-0.8 points).
  - **Incomplete representation**: Misses obvious pairs like ('PK','AS'), ('PT','AS'), ('CA','AS') despite including others like ('WS','AS'). "Representative" allows subset, but uneven coverage (e.g., heavy on SS/OP starts, light on late pairs) feels arbitrary. (-0.5 points).

- **Minor Issues (further deductions)**:
  - Stdevs occasionally implausibly low for long chains (e.g., ('OP','PT') stdev 9h vs. multi-day chain with 12h+ vars—underestimates propagation).
  - Redundant/overlapping pairs without added value (e.g., both ('PT','WS') and ('PK','DT')).
  - Comments reveal approximations (e.g., "~5 days 2 hours") but introduce unclarities (e.g., ('OP','PT') comment missing).
  - No pairs for AS as predecessor (logical, as it's last), but subset ok. (-0.5 points total).

Nearly flawless requires: all valid numeric pairs, consistent aggregations (±5% tolerance), full logical coverage without extras, no contradictions. This is strong but undermined by the invalid entry and inconsistencies—good effort, not excellent.
