**7.2**

### Critical Evaluation Summary (for transparency, not part of grade):
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: Correctly identified all intra-case recurring activities (Verify Documents x2 in C001/C003; Call Customer x2 in C002). Renames for these are contextually precise, drawing directly from "Additional Context" (e.g., "Additional Document Re-Verification" ties to "ID scan provided"; "Clarify Discrepancy via Outbound" to "clarify account discrepancy"). Revised log structure mirrors original. Justifications are brief, tied to positional/sequential clues and context, fulfilling task 4.
- **Flaws (why not higher; hypercritical deductions)**:
  - **Formatting/Technical Errors (-1.5)**: C003 table is malformed/broken (e.g., "| C003    | Post-Adjustment Document Check  2024-05-03 12:20 BranchOfficer Re-verify docs..." lacks pipes/columns; Approve row detached/incomplete with wrong timestamp "2024-05-03T12" vs original "12:30:00"). C002 activity names truncated ("Clarify Discrepancy via Outbound", "Confirm Adjustment via Follow-Up" – incomplete phrasing). Prevents clear presentation of revised log (task 3).
  - **Scope Overreach/Inaccuracy (-0.8)**: Renamed non-recurring activities (e.g., single "Call Customer" in C001/C003; single "Verify Documents" in C002; "Initiate Request"/"Adjust Account" everywhere), despite task specifying "activities that appear multiple times **within the same case**" and "**for each activity that recurs**". This introduces unnecessary changes (e.g., "Initiate In-Branch Request" differentiates across cases, not within) and inconsistent naming (e.g., "Initial Identity Verification" in C002 despite no second instance to disambiguate).
  - **Minor Inconsistencies/Unclarities (-0.5)**: Verbose/inconsistent naming conventions (e.g., "via Call" vs "via Outbound"; "Adjust Account Details" minor tweak vs full rewrite "Correct Missing Info Internally"). Justifications cover extras without noting they are non-recurring. No explicit list of **all** recurring activities upfront (task 1 partially implicit).
- **Overall**: Strong conceptual grasp and disambiguation for core requirements, but execution flaws (formatting critical for log presentation) and deviation from precise scope prevent "nearly flawless." Equivalent to B-/C+ work under strict rubric.
