**9.7**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—comprehensive, logically structured, directly responsive to the question, and analytically sharp. It precisely pinpoints bias loci (Steps 3, 4, 5), mechanistically explains *how* it's introduced (automated rules, confirmation/subconscious bias, compounding effects), balances justification arguments with robust counterpoints, and thoroughly addresses implications for fairness/equity. Language is precise, evidence-based (direct quotes/paraphrases from description), and free of fluff. No major inaccuracies or logical gaps.

**Minor Deductions (Strict/Hypercritical Lens):**
- **Speculative Phrasing (0.2 deduction):** "A 'Civic Darts Club' may appeal more to a specific demographic (e.g., older males)" introduces a plausible but un-evidenced example. While illustrative for proxy discrimination, it's an assumption not grounded in the description, risking overreach in a hypercritical read.
- **Slight Overstatement (0.1 deduction):** "Self-fulfilling prophecy" is interpretive flair for the unproven correlation; vivid but not strictly literal (description says "perceived," not prophetic).
- **Implicit Completeness (no deduction, but noted):** Doesn't explicitly confirm Steps 1–2 are neutral (though correctly omits them), which could be tighter for pedantic exhaustiveness.

These are nitpicks on an otherwise flawless response. At utmost strictness, it avoids 10.0 but earns elite marks for near-perfection.
