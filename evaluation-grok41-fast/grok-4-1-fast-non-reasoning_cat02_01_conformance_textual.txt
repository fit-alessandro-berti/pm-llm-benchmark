**8.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**:
  - Correctly identifies deviating cases: 2, 3, 5 (core task #1 flawless).
  - Compliant cases 1 and 4 accurately matched to normative paths.
  - Excellent summary of two valid paths and key constraints, directly referencing description (e.g., quotes prohibitions like "never after a cancellation").
  - Clear structure, case-by-case analysis with sequences and timestamps implicitly considered.
  - Addresses task #2 well: Explains violations with textual references, interprets no ambiguities impact analysis.
  - No misses on major rules (e.g., Ship after Cancel in Case 3; missing Package in Case 5).

- **Flaws Deducting Points (strict deductions for inaccuracies/logical issues)**:
  - **Case 2 Violation 2: Clear logical inaccuracy/unclarity (major deduction)**: States ""Ship order" occurs without prior "Package items" immediately before it". This is **factually wrong**—Package *did* occur prior to Ship (at 10:00 vs. 11:00). The real issue is Package's *position relative to Authorize* (not after it, violating "Authorize... before packaging"). Introducing "immediately before" is an unsupported invention (description requires sequential precedence, not immediacy). This misstates the violation, potentially confusing readers, and reflects sloppy logic. Overlisting as "2 violations" inflates when it's arguably one core precedence breach with cascading effects (-1.5 points).
  - **Minor overinterpretation**: Case 3 Violation 1 claims Cancel must be "*directly after* Check". Description says "directly proceed" in insufficient path, but "direct" isn't a rigid constraint—it's the *path choice* after Check that's key (Authorize implies sufficient inventory). Harmless but adds unnecessary rigidity (-0.3).
  - **Case 5**: Explanation solid but could explicitly quote "Only after items have been properly packaged" for perfection; implies but doesn't hyperlink tightly (-0.2).

- **Overall**: Nearly flawless on identification and most explanations (90%+ accurate), but Case 2's factual/logical error is a significant flaw under "hypercritical" criteria—not minor, as it undermines explanation credibility. No criminal/scope violations. 8.0 reflects "very good but not elite" (flawless would be 9.5–10.0).
