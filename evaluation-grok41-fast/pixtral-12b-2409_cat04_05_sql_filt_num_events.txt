The provided answer is flawless. The SQL query is logically correct, efficient, and precisely meets the requirements: it accurately computes event counts per `case_id` via CTE, joins back to filter exactly on `<= 6` events (excluding `> 6`), and returns the full event rows (`e.*`) only for qualifying cases. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, inefficiencies, or extraneous elements. The explanation is clear, concise, and pedagogically sound without errors. This is a model solution.
