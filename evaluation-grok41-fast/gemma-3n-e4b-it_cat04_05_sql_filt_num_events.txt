**9.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Correctness (Full Credit)**: The query logically achieves the exact requirement. It accurately computes event counts per `case_id`, filters to `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6`, and returns all columns (`e.*`) for matching events. No data loss, no extras; handles grouping/filtering perfectly as specified. Works in DuckDB (standard SQL).
- **Efficiency/Performance (Minor Deduction)**: Scans `event_log` twice (counting subquery + outer SELECT). A single-pass window function alternative (e.g., `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) <= 6`) would be more optimal, especially for large logs. Not required by prompt, but hypercritically, this is a missed optimization opportunity (-0.3).
- **Simplicity/Clarity (Minor Deduction)**: Unnecessary nested subquery (`SELECT case_id FROM ( ... ) AS case_counts WHERE ...`). Equivalent and cleaner: `WHERE e.case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6)`. The extra layer adds pointless complexity without benefit; `HAVING` is the idiomatic choice for post-aggregate filtering. Hypercritically, this is a structural flaw (-0.3).
- **Style/Formatting (Full Credit)**: Excellent indentation, consistent aliasing (`e`, `case_counts`), readable.
- **Completeness (Full Credit)**: Selects all columns (`*`), preserves full events for valid cases.
- **Explanation (Near Full Credit, Minor Nit)**: Thorough, accurate step-by-step breakdown. Maps directly to query logic. Minor: Phrases like "temporary table" are informal (it's a derived table), but harmless (-0.2 overall score impact).
- **Edge Cases**: Handles empty table, all cases >6 (returns nothing), exactly 6 events (included), ties/duplicates fine via GROUP BY.

**Total**: Nearly flawless (correct + well-explained), but minor structural inefficiency and unnecessary nesting prevent perfection. Strict docking: 10.0 - 0.8 = 9.2. A 10.0 demands zero nitpicks.
