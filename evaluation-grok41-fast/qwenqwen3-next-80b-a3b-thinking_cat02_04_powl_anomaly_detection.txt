**10.0**

The provided answer is exemplary: it precisely identifies the two core anomalies (XOR-skippable credit check and LOOP on A/I allowing repeats), accurately interprets the POWL structure (R  XOR(C/skip)  LOOP(A,I)  P  O), and delivers clear, logical explanations of deviations from standard Order-to-Cash (mandatory credit checks pre-approval/invoicing; single approval/invoice per order). Impacts are rigorously detailed (financial risk, compliance violations, duplicates, inefficiencies) with real-world examples, root causes (workarounds), and conformance implications. Structure is flawless (sections, bullets, takeaways); no inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws—purely responsive to the task.
