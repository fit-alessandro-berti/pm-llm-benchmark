The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and precise DuckDB SQL query that exactly matches the requirements: it identifies `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via a subquery with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then returns all events (`SELECT *`) for only those `case_id`s using `IN`. The query is idiomatic SQL, fully compatible with DuckDB, preserves the full set of events for qualifying cases, and excludes all events from disqualifying cases. The accompanying explanation accurately describes the logic without errors, ambiguities, or extraneous details. No inaccuracies, logical flaws, performance issues, or deviations from the spec.
