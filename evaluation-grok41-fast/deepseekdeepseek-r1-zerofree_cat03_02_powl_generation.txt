**10.0**

The final code is a precise, hierarchical POWL model that faithfully captures the entire scenario without inaccuracies, extraneous elements, or logical flaws. All dependencies are correctly enforced via nested StrictPartialOrders and operators: SR  CS  (DA  ACI)  *(BNC, D&R)  X(CD, MD)  (QA  SA)  GLA, with concurrency only where specified (no unintended orders), loop and XOR properly placed, no unnecessary silents, correct labels/names, and valid nesting per POWL semantics. Imports match the prompt/example; structure is clean and readable. No penalties apply.
