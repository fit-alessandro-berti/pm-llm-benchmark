**9.8**

The answer is exceptionally strong, nearly flawless in accuracy, clarity, and logical structure. It precisely identifies **Group B** as exhibiting bias (correct, as it contains the explicit `ScoreAdjustment` mechanism absent in Group A), with meticulous evidence from case comparisons (P002 vs. U001 for equal raw CulturalFit 60 yielding divergent outcomes; P002 vs. U003 for U003's inferior raw metrics—Skill 75<78, Personality 65<75, CulturalFit 58<60—still resulting in hire post-boost). Manifestation is hyperbolically detailed yet concise, correctly inferring a ~63 threshold consistent with all data (hired: 65,65,65,63; not: 60,60). Implications rigorously tie to meritocracy erosion, disparate impact on Protected Group A (LocalResident=FALSE, no access to boost), and proxy discrimination via club membership, invoking "old boys' network" aptly without overreach.

Hypercritical deductions (-0.2 total):
- Slight overstatement in "exact same measured level of cultural fit" for P002/U001: raw CulturalFit identical (60), but ancillary scores differ marginally (U001 Skill 80>78, Personality 72<75); immaterial to core bias (boost overrides), but not "exact" across board.
- Threshold "63" is data-perfect inference but unproven (e.g., no 61-64 cases); presented confidently without hedging as "apparent," risking minor logical overconfidence.
No other inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws; exceeds question scope without verbosity.
