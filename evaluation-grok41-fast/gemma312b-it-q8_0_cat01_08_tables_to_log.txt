**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (supporting ~7/10 base)**:
  - Correctly identifies **Case ID** as `order_id` for all 5 orders.
  - Accurately derives all **existing events**: "Order Created" (5 events), "Items Picked" (one per line item, 9 total, with correct per-item timestamps/pickers), "Order Dispatched"/"Order Arrived" (one pair per delivery record, 7 total, matching `delivery_id`/`order_id`), "Invoice Issued" (5 total), "Payment Received" (5 total). Granularity for multiples (picks, deliveries, invoices, payments) is meaningful and follows prompt examples.
  - **Timestamps** 100% correct and complete for all real events, in ISO format.
  - **Chronological order** perfect within each case (e.g., picks before dispatches, arrives before invoices/payments; 1002 multi-delivery sequence by time).
  - **Resources/Actors** appropriately mapped where data exists (sales_person_id for create, picker_id for picks, carrier_id for dispatch/arrive, billing_person_id for invoices; N/A for payments reasonable as no actor data).
  - All tables integrated via keys (order_id  lines  deliveries; order_id  invoices  payments).
  - Markdown table format correct.
  - Notes document assumptions well (multi-deliveries, missing data, etc.), per prompt.
  - Suitable for PM overall (34 valid rows reflect real flows/variants, e.g., 1002 split shipment).

- **Major Logical Flaw (-2.0)**:
  - Includes 4 **invalid placeholder rows for order 1004** ("Order Dispatched", "Order Arrived", "Invoice Issued", "Payment Received" with `Timestamp: N/A`, `Resource/Actor: N/A`). These are **non-events** (no supporting data in Delivery/Invoice/Payments tables). Event logs for PM must only contain **occurred events** (one row *per event*); fabricating placeholders distorts cases, breaks timestamp-based sorting/analysis, and violates "convert key steps... into events" and "chronological correctness." Should omit and note in assumptions (e.g., "1004 lacks delivery/invoice/payment records"). This affects ~10% of rows, making log unsuitable "as-is."

- **Minor Issues (-1.0 cumulative)**:
  - No **Other Attributes** column despite available data (e.g., `quantity`/`item_id` for picks, `invoice_amount` for invoices, `payment_method` for payments, `delivery_note`, `customer_id`/`order_priority` from Orders, carrier notes). Prompt specifies "Other Attributes (if available): Any additional relevant data" – enriching would improve PM utility (e.g., item-level granularity).
  - Uses resource **IDs** (e.g., "CR-01") instead of names (e.g., "GlobalTransport" from Resources table), reducing readability despite optional table.
  - **Inconsistency**: N/A only for 1004's missing phases; other missing resources (payments) handled per-row without full placeholder events. Unclear logic.
  - Activity names good but generic for multiples (e.g., all "Items Picked" identical; no distinction like "ITEM-001 Picked" even optionally).
  - No events inferred beyond prompt examples (e.g., no "Order Completed" or priority-based), but data doesn't strongly support.

Nearly flawless would omit N/As, add/enrich attributes, use names, and fully document gaps without table pollution (10.0). This is strong but critically flawed by invalid rows and missed enrichment.
