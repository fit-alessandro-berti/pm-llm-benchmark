**8.2**

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (supporting high base score):**
- **Accurate core identification**: Correctly pinpoints Group B's log as exhibiting bias due to the "+10 Community Boost" adjustment, tied exclusively to `LocalResident=TRUE` and specific `CommunityGroup`, unavailable to Group A (Protected). This is disparate treatment based on protected attributes (LocalResident FALSE for all A). Flawlessly links to `ScoreAdjustment` column.
- **Clear structure**: Key differences tabulated logically; bias location, manifestation, and implications separated. Outcomes counted correctly (2/3 approved each).
- **Strong causal explanation**: U003 example illustrates boost's impact (695  705 approved); hypothetical for protected equivalent is valid. Notes proxy discrimination via local club as socio-demographic correlate. Correctly flags systematic nature (rule-based, not noise) and masking by aggregate parity.
- **Fairness metrics**: Apt reference to conditional fairness (e.g., lower approval prob. for protected at same preliminary score); "equalized odds / conditional demographic parity" fits proxy/score-conditional bias context.
- **Comprehensive summary**: Ties back to disparate treatment and conditional disparities precisely.

**Flaws (deductions totaling -1.8; strict per instructions):**
- **Major logical inaccuracy (threshold inference, -1.0)**: Claims "implicit 700 approval threshold" and U003 "pushed above the line" to 705 (approved). Critically flawed—P002/U002 at **710** (higher than 705) are **rejected**. No consistent threshold supports ~700:
  | Score | No Boost (A/B) | Boosted (B) | Outcome |
  |-------|----------------|-------------|---------|
  | 710   | P002/U002     | N/A        | Rejected |
  | 705   | N/A           | U003       | Approved |
  Higher score rejected, lower approved contradicts monotonic score-based logic. Undermines "how bias alters decisions" (Section B); ignores/contradicts evidence. Hypothetical "695 rejected without boost" holds, but framing as threshold-crossing fails. Hypercritical: Central to manifestation explanation—significant deduction.
- **Minor unclarities/logical gaps (-0.5)**: 
  - "At 710: rejected—no gap"; "At 720: approved—no gap" accurate but incomplete—U001's 720 preliminary becomes 730 (boost irrelevant if 720 suffices, per P001). Doesn't probe why boost applies even above presumed threshold.
  - "for the same preliminary score the protected group has a lower probability of approval": True conditionally (boost proxy for unprotected), but no exact matching prelim scores below 710 (only U003 at 695); relies on extrapolation. Slight overstatement without data.
  - "Membership... functions as a socio-demographic proxy": Good, but `LocalResident` is near-perfect group proxy (100% TRUE in B, FALSE in A)—could emphasize correlation strength more crisply.
- **Minor overreach (-0.3)**: "Equalized odds" invokes true positive rate (requires ground-truth creditworthiness, absent here); better as "score parity" or "predictive parity." Pedantic but hypercritical flaw in technical precision.

**Overall**: Nearly flawless in identification/scope (9.5+ base), but threshold error is a pivotal inaccuracy in *how* bias manifests (core question), warranting sharp deduction. Comprehensive, insightful, no criminal/OT issues. 10.0 requires zero debatable flaws.
