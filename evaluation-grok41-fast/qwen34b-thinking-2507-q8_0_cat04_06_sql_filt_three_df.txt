The provided answer is flawless. The query precisely identifies bad cases using LAG/LEAD window functions to enforce direct succession (immediate prev/next per case/timestamp order), correctly filters for the exact sequence centered on 'Create Order' events with the >5-day condition via `next_timestamp - timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'` (valid DuckDB syntax), collects DISTINCT `case_id`s, and excludes all events from those cases via `NOT IN`. The final `SELECT *` returns only events from non-matching cases, with `ORDER BY timestamp` satisfying the "proper ordering" requirement. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical flaws; handles edge cases (e.g., NULLs from LAG/LEAD, multiple sequences per case) implicitly and correctly. Explanation reinforces without error.
