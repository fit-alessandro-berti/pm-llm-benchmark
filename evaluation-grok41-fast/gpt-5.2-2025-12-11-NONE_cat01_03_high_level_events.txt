**9.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
**Strengths (justifying high baseline):**
- **Comprehensive coverage**: All low-level events from both cases (A1, B2) are perfectly mapped into 6 groups with zero omissions, overlaps, or orphans. Aggregated traces explicitly demonstrate application to samples.
- **Logical groupings**: Temporal proximity (e.g., tight clustering within phases), resource consistency (e.g., Operator B for welding block), and semantic coherence (e.g., tool-pickup as enabler for welds) are rigorously applied. Splits like Intake vs. Setup are defensible (traceability vs. physical prep) and arguably *more* granular/precise than the prompt's illustrative "Material Preparation" example.
- **Rationales**: Each includes clear "why" (e.g., "logistics + traceability," "natural pair: application followed by curing"), tied to attributes like keywords, resources, outcomes (e.g., IntegrityScore), and phase logic (e.g., QA gate post-welding).
- **Naming**: Domain-relevant, descriptive (e.g., "Surface Protection & Curing"), with subtitles for clarity.
- **Structure**: Exceeds requirements—numbered sections, canonical table (exact mappings + resources), example traces, heuristics (scalable "rules" as prompted: "infer rules"), generalization notes.
- **Heuristics**: Bonus precision (keyword/resource/temporal rules), directly enabling "how to go from low-level to high-level" goal.

**Flaws/Deductions (strict, even minor issues penalized heavily):**
- **-0.4**: Single-event groups (e.g., #4 Measure, #6 Visual) are logically coherent but stretch "group these low-level events into meaningful, higher-level process steps" (plural "events" implied). They feel like trivial/non-aggregations; hypercritically, bundling Measure with Welding (as "in-process") or Visual with prior Finishing could be argued as more "coherent stage," diluting phase purity unnecessarily.
- **-0.2**: Intake excludes "Place metal sheet on table" despite identical resource (Operator A), ultra-tight timestamps (e.g., A1: 08:00:07 Scan  08:00:10 Place), and prompt example grouping it into "Material Preparation." Rationale ("distinct from physical setup") is solid but introduces arbitrary boundary; Place is equally "logistics" as Retrieve.
- **-0.1**: Aggregated traces use informal abbreviations (e.g., "Place on table Align Preheat") without full activity names, risking minor ambiguity despite table clarity.
- **-0.1**: Heuristics occasionally vague/overly specific (e.g., "Weld*" assumes pattern; "Dry/Cure"-type ignores exact log "Dry coating"). Minor, but "robust rule" claim invites nitpick.
No major inaccuracies/logical breaks (e.g., no missequencing, all timestamps/phases align), but cumulative minors prevent perfection. **Nearly flawless** (not "flawless" due to judgment calls on boundaries/singletons).
