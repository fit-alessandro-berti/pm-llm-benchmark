The response is exemplary and flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It delivers a valid, executable Python dictionary with 26 logically ordered pairs (9 direct successors covering the full linear chain SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS, plus 17 multi-step pairs), all respecting precedence. Averages are realistic supply-chain estimates (days/weeks/months in seconds: e.g., procurement ~2-14d, manufacturing ~1-3d, logistics ~0.5-7d, post-sale ~30d) and *precisely* cumulative (e.g., SSRC = SSOP + OPRC = 172800 + 1209600 = 1382400s; CADT = CAPT + PTPK + PKWS + WSDT = 259200 + 86400 + 43200 + 604800 = 993600s—verified for all). STDEVs scale appropriately with distance/variability (e.g., short direct ~10-25% of AVG, long-range ~20-35%, increasing with steps). It's a "representative subset" (prompt-compliant, ~60% of 45 possible pairs, ensuring complexity via multi-step). No inaccuracies (all pairs valid, no reverses/illogical skips), unclarities (clear labeling, seconds noted), or flaws (consistent math, realistic domain fit). Closing sentence reinforces intent without excess. Perfect adherence.
