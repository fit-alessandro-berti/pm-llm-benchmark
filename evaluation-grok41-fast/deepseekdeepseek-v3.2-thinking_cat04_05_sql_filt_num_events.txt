**10.0**

The provided SQL query is correct, efficient, and precisely meets the requirements. It accurately identifies cases with 6 events via the CTE (using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`), then retrieves all events from those cases via an `INNER JOIN`, returning `el.*` for the full event records. No inaccuracies, inefficiencies, or extraneous elements impact the result; the unused `event_count` alias is harmless. The explanation reinforces correctness without flaws.
