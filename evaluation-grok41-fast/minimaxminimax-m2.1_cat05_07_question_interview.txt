The provided answer is a meticulously structured, comprehensive list of 33 open-ended questions, perfectly aligned with the prompt's goals. It systematically organizes questions by process phase (e.g., Documentation, Property Manager Assignment, Exceptions), directly targeting missing details (e.g., checklists, mandatory fields), decision criteria (e.g., weighting factors, minimum tenant criteria), roles/responsibilities (e.g., who decides handoffs, authority for discounts), timing/sequencing (e.g., timelines, handoff triggers), and exceptions (e.g., special insurance, disqualifiers). Every question is conceptual, avoids any technical/SQL/implementation references, accurately reflects the described process without introducing flaws, and invites detailed clarification. No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or logical gaps—exemplary execution.
