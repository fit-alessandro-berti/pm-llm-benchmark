**7.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (justifying not lower than 7.0)**:
  - Sequence detection is flawless: Using `ROW_NUMBER()` for consecutive `seq_num` (a+1, a+2) perfectly captures "direct succession with no other event in between." Handles per-case ordering correctly.
  - Case exclusion logic is correct: `violating_cases` uses `DISTINCT` and targets cases with *at least one* such sequence exceeding the threshold (matches "cases that contain the sequence" + timing condition). Final `NOT IN` correctly returns **all events** from non-violating cases only.
  - Structure is clean, efficient CTEs, proper joins on `case_id` and `seq_num`. Final `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` is appropriate (though not strictly required).
  - Handles potential multiples per case correctly (exists-semantics).

- **Major Logical Flaw (deducting 3.0 points)**:
  - `DATE_DIFF('day', b.timestamp, c.timestamp) > 5` is **incorrect for "time elapsed ... more than 5 days"**.
    - Computes *floored full days* (e.g., 5 days + 1 second  5, not >5; 5 days + 23:59:59  5; only 6 full days triggers).
    - But "elapsed >5 days" requires precise duration: `confirm_ts - create_ts > INTERVAL '5' DAY` (captures 5.0001 days onward).
    - Produces **wrong results**: Cases with 5.1-day elapsed wrongly *included* (should be excluded). This fails the core timing filter.
    - Explanation acknowledges ("ignoring time-of-day fractions") and suggests fix, but **uses flawed version**—no credit for awareness; SQL must work correctly.

- **Minor Issues (no further deduction, as major already covered)**:
  - Assumes strictly increasing/unique `timestamp` per `case_id` (ROW_NUMBER() ties arbitrary)—typical but unstated; could fail if duplicates.
  - Explanation claims alignment with "typical interpretations in process mining"—debatable/subjective, not strict per prompt's "time elapsed."
  - No handling for NULL timestamps or non-datetime types (edge case, but prompt assumes valid datetimes).

Nearly flawless except the critical timing bug (central requirement). 10.0 requires zero functional issues; 7.0 reflects excellent structure marred by inaccuracy.
