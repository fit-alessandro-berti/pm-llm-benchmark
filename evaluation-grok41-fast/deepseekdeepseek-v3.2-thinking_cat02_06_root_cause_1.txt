**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless. It accurately calculates all durations with precise values matching the timestamps (e.g., Case 102: exactly 25.17 hours or 1510 minutes; Case 105: 49.08 hours accounting for 49h5m). Task 1 correctly identifies Cases 102, 104, and 105 as outliers, contrasting them sharply with 101 and 103.

Task 2 pinpoints root causes with exact delay measurements (e.g., Case 104's 3.5-hour assign-to-investigate; Case 105's 28-hour post-escalation gap; consistent 15–19-hour overnight patterns), distinguishing escalations (102, 105) from non-escalation delays (104), and logically ties them to handoffs, workload, and business-hour constraints without assumptions unsupported by data.

Task 3 provides clear, data-driven explanations of cycle time impacts (e.g., early delays cascading to overnight idle time) and actionable, prioritized recommendations (SLAs, workload balancing, shift overlaps, process mining) directly addressing identified bottlenecks.

Structure is exemplary (tables, bullets, headings), terminology consistent with the log (minor stylistic variations like "Level2" vs. "Level-2" are negligible), and no factual errors, ambiguities, redundancies, or unsubstantiated claims exist. Every conclusion is evidenced by specific timestamps/events.
