3.0

### Reasoning for Grade
Hypercritical evaluation summary (strict deductions for all flaws):

- **Fatal syntax error (-4.0)**: `sequence_cases` CTE has `MIN(timestamp) AS sequence_start_time`, but no `timestamp` column exists in the subquery's SELECT list (only `approve_time`, `create_time`, `confirm_time`). Query fails to parse/execute in DuckDB. Entire solution invalid.
- **Logical flaw in filtering (-2.5)**: Fails to tie the >5 days check specifically to the `Create Order`  `Confirm Order` pair **within the identified sequence**. `slow_sequence_cases` flags cases with *any* direct `Create`  `Confirm` >5 days if the case has a full sequence anywhere. Over-excludes cases with a fast full sequence + unrelated slow `Create``Confirm` pair (e.g., `ApproveCreate1Confirm1` fast direct-direct, later `Create2Confirm2` slow direct). Prompt requires excluding only cases with at least one *full bad sequence* ("of that sequence"). Incorrect results.
- **Unnecessary/unused complexity (-0.5)**: `sequence_start_time` computed but never used. Could be single CTE finding bad triples directly.
- **Minor issues (-0.5)**: Explanation claims "exact pair ... with no intervening events" but doesn't clarify linkage to sequence. No `DISTINCT` in CTEs (risks duplicate case_ids, though `NOT IN` tolerates).

Total deductions leave minimal credit for correct elements (self-join structure, NULL checks for direct succession, final exclusion/ordering). Solution is broken and imprecise; not "nearly flawless."
