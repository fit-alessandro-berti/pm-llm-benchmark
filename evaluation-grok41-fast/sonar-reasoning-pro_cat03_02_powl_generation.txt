**2.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Summary (Strict Grading Rationale):
- **Critical Syntax and Structural Failures (Fatal, -8 points)**: 
  - No `main_process` (or equivalent root `StrictPartialOrder`) is ever instantiated/defined—code references undefined variable repeatedly, rendering the entire model unconstructable.
  - Invalid method calls like `main_process.add_edge(sr.cs)` (`.cs` is not a valid attribute/method; should be `root.order.add_edge(sr, cs)`). Similar errors throughout: `cs.da_a ci_concurrency` (typo/spacing), `lconf.depl oyment_xor` (undefined `lconf`, spacing), `deplo y_xor.final_steps_with_gla` (spacing/typos).
  - `print(main_process)` fails as `main_process` does not exist.
  - Final code is **non-executable Python**, producing NameError/SyntaxError—does not produce a valid POWL model.

- **Logical/POWL Modeling Inaccuracies (-1 point)**:
  - Post-deployment (`final_steps_with_gla`): `StrictPartialOrder([final_steps])` then `.nodes.add(gla)` then `.order.add_edge(final_steps.gla)`—`final_steps.gla` is invalid (no such attribute); correct would be `.order.add_edge(final_steps, gla)`. Fails to enforce QA/SA  GLA properly (GLA could execute prematurely). Better: single `StrictPartialOrder([qa, sa, gla])` with two edges.
  - No enforcement that DA/ACI complete **both** before loop (edge from `da_aci_concurrency` suffices in theory, but broken main structure prevents it).
  - Missing SR  CS explicit edge (implied but not coded).

- **Minor Clarity/Unimplemented Details (-0.5 points each, total -1)**:
  - `StrictPartialOrder` constructor in explanation `[da], [aci]` is wrong (single list arg: `[da, aci]`).
  - No `SilentTransition` import/usage (unnecessary here, but example mentions it).
  - No top-level root exposing the full model (e.g., `root` variable).
  - Explanation claims "mirrors real-world... [1][4]"—unreferenced citations, irrelevant.

- **Partial Credits (+1.5 points)**: Correctly creates all `Transition` labels/abbreviations. Correctly builds sub-components (loop, XOR, DA/ACI PO). Intent matches scenario structure.

**Overall**: Structure conceptually sound in isolation, but assembly is catastrophically flawed—non-functional code fails core task of "constructing the corresponding POWL model". Not "nearly flawless"; qualifies as minimal viable attempt.
