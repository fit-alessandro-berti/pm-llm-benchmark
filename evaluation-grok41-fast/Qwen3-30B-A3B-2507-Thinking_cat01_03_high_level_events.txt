**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score):**
  - **Complete coverage**: All 12 low-level events per case are grouped without overlap or omission, correctly mapping across both cases (A1, B2).
  - **Structured output**: Excellently formatted with clear sections, grouped events listed verbatim from "Activity" column, rationales per group, summary table, and overall summary. Aligns perfectly with "structured representation" requirement.
  - **Grouping logic mostly sound**: Temporal proximity well-applied to Material Preparation (consecutive, ~15s), Core Assembly (consecutive, ~20s), Protective Finishing (consecutive, ~15s). Logical workflow (prep  assembly  quality  finish) reflects manufacturing phases; names are domain-relevant ("Material Preparation," "Core Assembly," etc.).
  - **Scalability & goal achievement**: Explicitly addresses full log patterns, proposes metrics, and creates "glanceable" high-level workflow—directly hits "Goal."
  - **Justifications generally strong**: Criteria (temporal, resource, logical) consistently applied; explanations differentiate groups (e.g., "Why not grouped with X?").

- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness):**
  - **Factual inaccuracies in rationales (major flaw, -1.5):** 
    - Quality Inspection: Claims "Weld measurement (08:01:20) immediately precedes visual check (08:02:00), with **no intervening steps**"—false. Coating (08:01:30) and drying (08:01:45) intervene (~40s gap). This misstates the log.
    - Protective Finishing: Claims "quality is passed (**e.g., both cases show "Check: Passed" before coating**)"—false. "Check: Passed" is in Visual check's AdditionalInfo (08:02:00, *after* coating/drying).
  - **Logical flaw in Quality grouping (-0.8):** Events are non-contiguous (Finishing splits Measure from Visual); violates "temporally close" criterion emphasized in prompt/instructions. Measure is weld-specific (post-assembly), Visual is final post-finishing—grouping spans phases illogically, despite "resource consistency" stretch (Sensor vs. Operator C).
  - **Minor unclarities/inconsistencies (-0.3):** "Core Assembly" name slightly verbose (prompt example: "Assembly"); table implies direct `Measure weld  Visual check` sequence, reinforcing temporal error. Preheat justified as prep (good), but 40s gap to assembly unaddressed vs. smaller gaps elsewhere.
  - **No self-correction**: Errors persist in final conclusions.

- **Overall**: Strong structure/logic elevates from mid-range, but factual/logical errors in core rationales (required element) prevent "nearly flawless." Equivalent to a solid B but penalized harshly per "utmost strictness" (e.g., no 9+ without zero inaccuracies).
