**9.0**

This query is logically flawless and highly efficient, using a window function to compute event counts per `case_id` in a single pass, then filtering correctly to include only events from cases with 6 events total. It precisely achieves the goal: all rows for qualifying cases are retained, none for others. DuckDB fully supports this syntax.

Minor deduction for selecting only `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp` instead of `*` (or all original columns). The prompt specifies "at least" these columns and requests the "full set of events," implying all columns should be returned to preserve complete row data. If additional columns exist (e.g., `user_id`), they are omitted, making it not fully general. A perfect answer would use a GROUP BY subquery like:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM event_log 
WHERE case_id IN (
  SELECT case_id 
  FROM event_log 
  GROUP BY case_id 
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

This avoids extra columns and selects all originals exactly. The window approach is clever but requires listing columns to exclude `event_count`, which is impractical without knowing the schema. No other issues: clear, concise, no errors, no performance flaws. Nearly flawless, hence 9.0 under hypercritical standards.
