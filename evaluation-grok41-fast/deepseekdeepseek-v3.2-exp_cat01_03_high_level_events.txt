**7.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is strong in structure, coverage, and overall presentation but contains **significant logical and temporal flaws** in one key grouping, violating core prompt criteria for "coherent stage[s]" via temporal proximity and logical flow. Minor unclarities and overstatements compound deductions. Breakdown:

#### **Strengths (Supporting Higher Score)**
- **Full Coverage**: All 12 low-level events per case are assigned without omission or duplication.
- **Structured Output**: Excellent use of table for high-level steps, rationales, and event lists; aggregated view for A1 adds clarity; overall strategy section ties back to criteria (temporal, logical, resource).
- **Justifications**: Mostly sound (e.g., Prep and Assembly rationales precisely cite proximity, resources, domain logic). Names are domain-relevant and meaningful.
- **Pattern Inference**: Correctly identifies consistency across A1/B2; respects prompt example (Prep matches exactly).
- **Goal Achievement**: Transforms granular log into glanceable 4-step workflow effectively *despite* flaws.

#### **Fatal Flaws (Major Deductions: -2.0 total)**
- **Incoherent Grouping for "Final Quality Inspection"**:
  - Includes "Measure weld integrity" (08:01:20, post-weld, pre-coating) with "Visual check" (08:02:00, post-coating). These are **not temporally proximate** (40s gap with *intervening coating events*) nor a single "coherent stage": measure is weld-specific QA immediately after assembly; visual is holistic final check. Logically, measure belongs with Assembly (tight sequence: welds at :05-:10  measure :20 by sensor). Grouping disrupts process flow dependencies.
  - **Contradicts own criteria**: Claims "temporal proximity" and "rapid succession" for groups, but inspection spans non-contiguous events across phases. "Slight time gap" is false (interrupted by full Coating step).
- **Sequential Order Violation**:
  - Presents steps as "**four distinct, sequential stages**" and lists 1234, but timestamps contradict: Inspection starts *before* Coating (08:01:20 vs. 08:01:30). Aggregated view timestamps overlap (Inspection 08:01:20-08:02:00 engulfs Coating 08:01:30-45), undermining "sequential" claim and process model clarity.
  - Note ("out of sequence in the log... might be adjusted") is misleading—log *is* sequential; flaw is in grouping/presentation. Fudging timestamps erodes credibility.
- **Misleading Name/Positioning**: "Final Quality Inspection" implies end-stage, but measure is mid-process (post-assembly, pre-finishing). Not "at the end of the process" as rationalized.

#### **Minor Flaws (Deductions: -0.8 total)**
- **Overstatements**: "Tightly coupled" for Assembly ok, but strategy's "rigid sequence... groupings respect natural dependencies" ignores inspection dependency flaw.
- **Unclarities**: No explicit handling for B2 (prompt has multiple cases); assumes identical but doesn't confirm. Aggregated view only for A1—prompt implies general rules.
- **Missed Nuance**: Ignores resource progression fully (e.g., post-weld sensor as Assembly extension). No proposal for edge cases (e.g., if scores fail).
- **Formatting Nit**: Table uses HTML-style `<ul>` (unnecessary in plain response); rationale repeats "single object" etc. slightly redundantly.

#### **Scoring Rationale**
- Base: 10.0 for flawless.
- -2.0 for core grouping/temporal/logic failures (prevents "coherent stages" and "easier to understand workflow at a glance").
- -0.8 for minors/overstatements/unclarities.
- **Net: 7.2** (Good/strong but not "nearly flawless"—flaws are noticeable on inspection, warranting strict penalty per instructions. A flawless version would group measure into Assembly/Welding QA, yielding clean sequence: Prep  Assembly+Measure  Coating  Final Visual, with matching timestamps/order).
