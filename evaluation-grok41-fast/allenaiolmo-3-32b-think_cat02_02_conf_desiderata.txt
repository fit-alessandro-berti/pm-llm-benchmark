**9.0**

The answer is structured clearly and directly addresses all three tasks with precise identifications, explanations, a helpful summary table, and appropriate justifications that distinguish between normative (unjustifiable) and desiderata (explainable) issues. Normative violations are flawlessly identified (Case 2's three specific issues correct; Cases 1/3 clean). Desiderata failures correctly pinpoint timings in Case 3, Credit timing compliance in Case 2, and missing Follow-up in Cases 2/3, with proper clarification of suboptimality. Justifications are balanced ("when possible," no excuses for strict rules). Minor deductions for: (1) slight inconsistency in flagging missing Follow-up Call only for Cases 2/3 despite absence from all logs (logical flaw, though arguably aligned with problem's explicit Case 3 note); (2) trivial phrasing unclarities (e.g., "**Cases 1 and 2**:" header likely typo for Case 1 notes; "Jan 12  Jan 14" missing "to"). No major inaccuracies, omissions, or logical errors in conclusions; nearly flawless under hypercritical lens.
