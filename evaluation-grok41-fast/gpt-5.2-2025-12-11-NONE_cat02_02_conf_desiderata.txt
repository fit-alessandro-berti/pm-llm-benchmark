**7.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
**Strengths (justifying score above 5.0):**
- **Accurate core normative analysis (80% of Task 1):** Correctly identifies Case 1 as compliant; Case 3 as normatively compliant (rightly separates timing from strict rules); Case 2's two explicit violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection) with precise timestamps and rule mappings. Matches "What is Not Allowed" perfectly for those.
- **Task 2 partial coverage:** Correctly calculates Case 3 delays (49h/51h) with evidence; clarifies desiderata as "suboptimal but not severe." Notes encouraged nature of Follow-up Call.
- **Task 3 strong:** Provides plausible, rule-aligned justifications (e.g., data-entry delays, external dependencies, mis-labeling) without fabricating facts or contradicting strict rules. Distinguishes "happy path" for Case 1.
- **Structure/clarity:** Well-organized with sections, tables implied via bullets, summary. Concise explanations.
- **No major inventions:** Stays grounded in log/text.

**Flaws Deducting from 10.0 (Strict Penalty Application):**
- **Major inaccuracy/omission in Task 1 (Case 2 normative, -1.5):** Fails to identify **missing "Inform Applicant"** as a **strict normative violation**. Rules mandate: "Loan Decision  Inform Applicant" *always* (pre-branch), no skips allowed. Log has Decision (09:30)  Finalize (10:00)  Close (10:30), skipping entirely. Buried as "potentially another normative violation" in Task 2 with hedging ("if we take the log literally... omission in the extracted log"). This is *definite* per log—no evidence of presence. Equivalent to skipping (forbidden). Hypercritical: This is a core sequence break, like the flagged order/finalize issues; ignoring it makes analysis incomplete/false.
- **Inconsistent/unclear desiderata handling (Task 2, -0.8):** 
  - Follow-up Call (encouraged for *all* cases pre-Close): Absent in *all* logs, yet only flagged for Case 3; Case 1 excused as "mild deviation only if you treat it as expected... I’ll consider ‘good’" (self-referential "You didn’t flag it"; arbitrary). Case 2 ignored amid normative mess. Task requires *identifying which cases fail*—should uniformly note all three miss it as suboptimal.
  - Case 2: Claims "no clear desiderata timing breach" but uncheckable (no Inform); conflates with normative without clean separation.
- **Minor logical flaws/unclarities (-0.3):** 
  - Case 1 desiderata: Awkward "(You didn’t flag it here, so I’ll consider Case 1 operationally “good”)"—meta-reference to question annoys, implies bias.
  - Case 2 interpretation: "Parallel/exception handling... contradicts strict rules" is good caveat, but "should be treated as non-compliance unless model updated" slightly drifts into advice, not pure justification.
  - Summary hedges Case 2 Inform as "potentially," undermining firmness.
  - Typos/formatting: "Application Received  Credit Check" (missing punctuation); "Delay  49 hours" (spacing).
- **Missed exhaustiveness (-0.2):** No desiderata check for Case 1/2 timings explicitly (e.g., Case 1 good, Case 2 Credit within 1h but Inform N/A). Task wants per-case ID.

**Why not lower?** 70%+ flawless on positives; flaws are omissions/inconsistencies, not wholesale errors. **Why not 9+?** Not "nearly flawless"—missing Inform is a material gap in strict rules analysis (parallel to question's annotated violations); desiderata inconsistency shows logical sloppiness. Strict rubric demands perfection on rule fidelity.
