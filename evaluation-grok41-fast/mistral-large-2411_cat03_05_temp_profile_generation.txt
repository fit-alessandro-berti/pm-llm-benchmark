**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (why not lower)**:
  - Perfect format: Valid Python dictionary syntax, keys as tuples `('A', 'B')` with `A` before `B` in sequence, values as `(avg, std)` tuples in seconds. Comments enhance clarity.
  - Comprehensive coverage: Exhaustive forward pairs (45 total for 10 activities in linear order: 1 to 9 = 45), exceeding "representative subset" while ensuring "complexity" via multi-step pairs (e.g., SS to AS spans 9 steps). Matches "eventually following each other."
  - Reasonable domain estimates: Times scale logically for supply chain (e.g., SS-OP quick at 1h; OP-RC ~20h lead time; assembly/testing days; distribution quick; AS post-shipment). Std devs scale roughly with distance/variability (e.g., supplier delays higher std).
  - Additive consistency in most chains: Mid/late pairs add up perfectly (e.g., RC-QI 10800 + QI-CA 18000 = RC-CA 28800; PT-PK 12960 + PK-WS 10800  PT-WS 23760).
  - Intro text aligns with task: Explains construction, assumptions, units.

- **Fatal Flaws (major deductions: logical inaccuracies)**:
  - **Non-additive averages (core violation)**: In strictly sequential process (implied by "each execution involves [ordered list]"), `avg(AC) = avg(AB) + avg(BC)` must hold exactly for averages over traces. Systematic failure in **all SS-involved chains**:
    | Chain | Listed avg SSX | SS-OP + OPX | Discrepancy |
    |-------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
    | SSRC | 86400 | 3600 + 72000 = 75600 | +10800 |
    | SSQI | 97200 | 3600 + 82800 = 86400 | +10800 |
    | SSCA | 115200 | 3600 + 100800 = 104400 | +10800 |
    | SSPT | 138240 | 3600 + 123840 = 127440 | +10800 |
    | ... (pattern holds for all 9 SS pairs) | | | **Exactly +10800s (3h)** |
    - Impossible without negative times, skips, or parallelism (contradicts linear assumption). Suggests copy-paste error (added RC-QI offset blindly). Invalid model—temporal profile breaks transitivity.
  - Std dev inconsistency with sums: For independents, `std(AC)  (std(AB)² + std(BC)²)`; here mismatched (e.g., SSRC std 14400 vs (1800² + 10800²)  10946; close but not rigorous, and ignores covariance).

- **Minor Issues (further deductions)**:
  - Exceeds "representative subset": Full matrix vs. "subset" (though more complete is arguably better, strict reading penalizes overkill).
  - Short AS times unrealistic (e.g., DTAS 3h; after-sales typically weeks post-delivery, not hours).
  - Std devs arbitrary/proportional but not variance-based (e.g., SS-OP std=50% avg too high for quick step; inconsistent ratios: 0.5 for short, ~0.17 for long).
  - Casual intro ("Sure, let's construct") slightly unprofessional vs. direct output.

- **Scoring**: Starts at 10.0, deduct 1.5 for additive flaw (critical logic error), 0.8 for std mismatches, 0.3 for excess pairs/unrealistic AS, 0.2 minor. **Nearly flawless requires zero logic breaks**—this has glaring model invalidity. 7.2 reflects strong execution undermined by sloppiness.
