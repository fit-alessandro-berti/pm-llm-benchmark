**9.0**

### Reasoning for Grade
This answer is excellent in structure, clarity, logic, and completeness—nearly flawless overall, warranting a very high score. However, under hypercritical scrutiny, two minor-but-actionable issues prevent a perfect 10.0:

#### Strengths (Justifying 9+ Score)
- **Logic is impeccable (10/10)**: 
  - Perfectly captures *direct succession* via `rn + 1` joins—no gaps, exact order.
  - Correctly identifies cases with **at least one** matching sequence *and* `ts3 - ts2 > 5 days`.
  - Excludes *entire cases* matching both criteria, returning **all events** from remaining cases (`el.*`).
  - Handles multiples via `DISTINCT`.
- **Performance & DuckDB idioms (10/10)**: Window functions + self-joins efficient; `ROW_NUMBER()` correctly orders by `timestamp`.
- **Completeness (10/10)**: Adds sensible `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp`; prompt mentions "proper ... ordering".
- **Explanation (10/10)**: Step-by-step CTE table, markdown polish, key decisions section hyper-clear and accurate (e.g., emphasizes "no intermediate events").
- **No over/under-filtering**: Keeps cases with sequence but 5 days; excludes only "bad" ones.

#### Deductions (Strictly Minor, -0.5 total  9.0)
1. **Syntax inaccuracy (-0.3)**: `(ts3 - ts2) > INTERVAL '5' DAY` fails in DuckDB. 
   - `'5'` *quoted string* + `DAY` keyword = parse error (interval literal expects unquoted numeric like `INTERVAL 5 DAY` or string like `INTERVAL '5 days'`).
   - Claimed as "DuckDB's native ... syntax" is slightly imprecise (native prefers `INTERVAL 5 DAY`).
   - Fix: `INTERVAL 5 DAY` (no quotes). Trivial 1-char edit, but executable flaw per "inaccuracies".
2. **Edge-case unaddressed (-0.2)**: No handling for tied `timestamp`s within `case_id` (arbitrary `ROW_NUMBER()` order). Event logs often assume strict ordering, but hypercritically, `ORDER BY timestamp, activity` (or tiebreaker) would be safer. Minor, as prompt implies timestamp-ordered succession.

No logical flaws, ambiguities, or extras. Runs correctly post-fix; beats 99% of solutions. 10.0 requires zero tweaks.
