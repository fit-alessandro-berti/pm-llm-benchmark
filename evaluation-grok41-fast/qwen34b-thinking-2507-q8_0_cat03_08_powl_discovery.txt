**10.0**

The final POWL model is precise, complete, and accurately captures all observed behaviors in the event log across all cases:

- Sequential prefix (OR  MS  QS) enforced correctly.
- `loop1 = * (AS, IQC)` generates exactly the AS-(IQC AS)* patterns (e.g., single AS in Case 4; AS IQC AS in Case 1/2; AS IQC AS IQC AS IQC AS in Case 3).
- `loop2 = * (TST, RT)` generates TST-(RT TST)* patterns (e.g., single TST in Cases 2/4; TST RT TST in Cases 1/3; longer in Case 5).
- `xor_lb = X (LB, skip)` handles optional LB post-PK (skipped in Case 2).
- StrictPartialOrder chains all nodes sequentially (QS  loop1  loop2  PK  xor_lb  DP  D), matching timestamps and no concurrency.
- Code is syntactically correct, uses exact POWL classes/operators, and requires no execution to verify fidelity.
- No extraneous nodes, no missing dependencies, no over-modeling (e.g., no unwarranted concurrency or choices).

Flawless representation; zero inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical issues.
