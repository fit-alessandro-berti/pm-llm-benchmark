**9.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: The response fully adheres to the core prompt. All 20 questions are **targeted, open-ended** (using "Can you...", "What...", "How...", etc.), directly derived from the process description, and systematically cover **missing details** (e.g., Q8 on pricing data), **decision criteria** (e.g., Q2, Q7, Q9), **roles/responsibilities** (e.g., Q1, Q5, Q13), **timing/sequencing** (e.g., Q3, Q5), and **exceptions** (e.g., Q4, Q11, Q17, Q20). No SQL queries or overt technical implementation (e.g., no code, schemas, or builds). Intro and closing effectively frame the list without fluff. Comprehensive (20 questions) without redundancy; logical progression from early to late stages, then oversight/exceptions.
  
- **Deduction Reasons (Strict/Hypercritical Flaws)**:
  - **Minor violation risk on "implementation details" (-0.4)**: Q12 explicitly probes "Which internal tools (CRM, project manager, document repository) do you use at each step, and how are communications and approvals routed through them?" The prompt **strictly prohibits "implementation details"**, and while tools are mentioned generically in the description, naming specifics ("which") and mechanics ("routed through them") edges into operational implementation (e.g., could elicit software configs or workflows beyond pure concepts). This is borderline but a flaw under hypercriticism—conceptual deepening should stick to *how* generically, not inventorying tools.
  - **Over-breadth in one question (-0.2)**: Q1 ("each stakeholder’s responsibilities ... at every major phase") is comprehensive but risks being *too* sweeping for a single question, potentially overwhelming the interviewee and diluting "targeted" focus. Minor logical flaw: assumes interviewee can recall all without fatigue.
  - **Slight scope creep (-0.1)**: Q16 (KPIs/metrics) and Q19 (post-mortems/audits) introduce process *evaluation* metrics not explicitly in the description or prompt aims (focus is onboarding process understanding, not performance tracking). Useful but not core-mandated.
  - **Minor stylistic unclarities (-0.1)**: "Project manager" in Q12 likely typo/meant "project management" (per description); intro says "your property-onboarding workflow" (fine for role-play but assumes direct address).

- **Why not 10.0?** Not "nearly flawless"—the Q12 tool probe is a clear interpretive risk against the "no implementation details" rule (even if defensible), compounded by tiny overreaches. Under utmost strictness, this docks from perfection.
- **Why not below 9.0?** No major inaccuracies, logical gaps, or off-topic questions; 95%+ alignment makes it exceptional despite nitpicks.
