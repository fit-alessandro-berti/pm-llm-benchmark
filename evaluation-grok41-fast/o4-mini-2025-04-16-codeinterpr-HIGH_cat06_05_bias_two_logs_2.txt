**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—cogent, structured, evidence-based, and directly responsive to the query (identifies **Group B** as biased, explains manifestation via the explicit +5 boost policy, and thoroughly discusses fairness/equity implications with remedies). It accurately parses the logs, highlights disparate treatment (e.g., raw CF=60  hired only with boost; raw 58  hired post-boost vs. 65 threshold elsewhere), and ties to concepts like treatment parity and disparate treatment bias. No major inaccuracies or logical gaps; implications are nuanced (e.g., compound disadvantage risk) and practical.

**Minor flaws deducting 0.8 total (strict penalty per instructions):**
- **Slight overstatement of equivalence (0.3 deduction):** "Disparate outcomes at equal ability levels" and "solely because of the boost" for P002 vs. U001. Raw CF=60 matches perfectly, but overall profiles differ slightly (P002: Skill=78/Pers=75; U001: Skill=80/Pers=72). U003's hire (post-boost CF=63) has meaningfully lower Skill=75/Pers=65 vs. Group A hires, strengthening the bias claim but not making abilities "equal." Hypercritically, this loosens precision without qualifiers like "comparable profiles" or "CF-controlling."
- **Unclarity in phrasing (0.2 deduction):** "those same rawscore candidates in Group A (and U002 in Group B)"—grammatically awkward ("rawscore" should be "raw-score"); mildly unclear if referencing exact parallels (P002=U002=U001 raw CF).
- **Minor incompleteness (0.3 deduction):** Doesn't explicitly note Group B's LocalResident=TRUE (vs. A's FALSE) as contextualizing why the club boosts unprotected subgroup, though inferred well. Omits that decisions likely integrate all scores (Skill/Pers/CF), not CF alone—bias manifests via CF adjustment, but logs imply holistic review (e.g., P003 Skill=82 > U003=75 yet similar outcome post-boost). Remedies are solid but could specify auditing for disparate impact (statistical test) beyond treatment.

Nearly flawless (structure, evidence mapping, implications); flaws are nitpicks but warrant deduction under "utmost strictness." Scores 9.5 reserved for zero-issue perfection.
