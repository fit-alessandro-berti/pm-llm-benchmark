The provided answer is flawless. It correctly uses `ROW_NUMBER()` partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `timestamp` to identify consecutive events via `rn + 1` joins, precisely capturing "direct succession" with no intervening events. The time condition `(n3.timestamp - n2.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'` is accurate for DuckDB (subtracting timestamps yields an interval, and comparison with `INTERVAL '5 days'` works correctly for strict "> 5 days"). The `NOT IN` exclusion targets entire cases with at least one matching sequence and timing violation, returning *all events* from non-matching cases as required. No extraneous grouping, ordering, or filtering; `SELECT *` suffices. The explanation is precise, reinforcing correctness without errors. No ambiguities, edge cases mishandled (e.g., multiple sequences per case correctly excluded), or syntax issues.
