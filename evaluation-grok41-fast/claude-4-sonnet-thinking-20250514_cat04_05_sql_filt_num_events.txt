**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Core Query Correctness (Main Subquery Approach)**: Flawless. Uses standard, efficient GROUP BY + HAVING to identify qualifying `case_id`s (6 events), then IN to filter and return full rows via `SELECT *`. Handles "full set of events" perfectly, preserving all columns (critical since table has "at least" specified columns). No performance issues in DuckDB context. **Perfect (10/10)**.
- **Explanation**: Clear, accurate step-by-step for main query. Labels subquery components precisely. **Perfect (10/10)**.
- **ORDER BY Clause**: Unrequested but logically sound (groups by `case_id`, sorts chronologically within cases—useful for event logs/process mining). No harm, enhances utility without altering semantics. **Near-perfect (9.5/10)**.
- **Alternative 1 (Window Function)**: Functionally correct for filtering logic (COUNT OVER PARTITION BY works identically). However, **critical flaw**: Outer `SELECT` explicitly names only `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`, omitting any additional columns (table has "at least" these, implying possibles like resources/attributes). Does **not** return the "full set of events." Also drops `events_per_case`. **Major deduction (6/10)**.
- **Alternative 2 (CTE + JOIN)**: Fully correct. `SELECT el.*` preserves all columns; INNER JOIN equivalent to IN subquery. Improves readability as claimed. **Perfect (10/10)**.
- **Closing Claim ("All three approaches will produce the same result")**: **Inaccurate**. Window version differs in output schema (fewer columns), violating "same result" and "full set of events." Misleads on equivalence. Even if table had *exactly* those columns (unspecified), explicit column list is less robust than `*`. **Significant flaw (5/10)**.
- **Overall Structure/Clarity**: Polished, comprehensive, DuckDB-appropriate. No syntax errors, ambiguities, or logical gaps in primary solution. Extras add value but introduce the noted issues.

**Why not 10.0?** The window alternative + false "same result" claim are non-negligible inaccuracies (output mismatch on unspecified columns). Under hyper-strict criteria, this prevents "nearly flawless." Deduction calibrated to ~0.8 total for these (minor extras don't tank core perfection). No criminal/off-policy issues.
