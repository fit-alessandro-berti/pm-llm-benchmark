**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**: 
  - Correctly identifies **Group B (unprotected log) as exhibiting bias** (precise to question; Group A shows no adjustments, so bias manifests where favorable treatment via boost occurs).
  - Accurately pinpoints mechanism: ScoreAdjustment (+10 "Community Boost") triggered only by LocalResident=TRUE + CommunityGroup="Highland Civic Darts Club", unavailable to Group A (all FALSE/None), leading to systematic favoritism for qualifying Group B cases (U001, U003 approved despite equal/lower raw scores vs. Group A equivalents).
  - Excellent structure (numbered sections, clear data flow analysis, outcome examples like U003 vs. P002/U002).
  - Strong discussion of attributes' role (LocalResident as "gateway", CommunityGroup as proxy), systematic differences (offset lower raw scores, unequal decision boundaries, disparate error rates).
  - Good use of evidence (e.g., identical 710 rejections confirm boost flips U003; 720 cases match pre-boost).
  - Insightful extras (fairness principles, remedies) enhance without detracting.

- **Inaccuracies (significant deductions)**:
  - **Factual error in summary**: Claims "every applicant in the unprotected log satisfies both conditions" — false. U002 (TRUE/None) does **not** (no boost, correctly rejected like P002). Overstates universality; protected can't qualify, but not "every" unprotected does. (-0.6)
  - **Logical flaw in threshold analysis (2a)**: Infers "operational cut-off lies somewhere above 710" from Group A (710 reject, 720 approve). Then claims boost "lifts [U003] to 705 and the case is approved", implying 705 clears the ">710" bar. Impossible (705 < 710). Unaddressed inconsistency: same Rules Engine rejects 710 (P002/U002) but approves 705 (U003 adjusted). Either rules aren't score-only/threshold-based, or Group B gets further favoritism (e.g., attribute-based disparate treatment); glossing this undermines "threshold distortion" proof. (-0.9)
  - Minor unclarity: "everywhere carries forward a lower 'effective' score even when... same" — true for boosted matches (730 > 720), but 720 pre-boost both approve (no difference); bias shines in low-score cases only. (-0.2)
  - Minor overclaim (3): "CommunityGroup... populated (present only in the unprotected group)" — non-None only there, but U002 shows "None" (populated as absent). (-0.1)

- **Overall**: Nearly comprehensive/flawless (would be 10 without errors), but inaccuracies/logical flaws are non-trivial (mislead on scope/strength of bias). Strict deduction for not being "nearly flawless"; covers question fully but with cracks. No criminality/off-policy issues.
