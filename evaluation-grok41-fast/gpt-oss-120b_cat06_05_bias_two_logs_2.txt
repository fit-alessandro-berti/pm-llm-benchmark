The answer is nearly flawless: it precisely identifies Group B as biased due to the exclusive +5 association boost favoring unprotected candidates; accurately computes and contextualizes identical hire rates (2/3) while demonstrating mechanistic unfairness via case comparisons (e.g., U001 vs. P002); manifests bias clearly through structured tables on disparate treatment; rigorously discusses implications (legality, meritocracy, privilege reinforcement) without overreach; and provides actionable, job-relevant mitigations. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical gaps—hypercritical review confirms completeness and precision.
