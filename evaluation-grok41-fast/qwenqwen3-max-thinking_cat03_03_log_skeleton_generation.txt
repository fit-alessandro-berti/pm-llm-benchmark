**3.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Structure (minor positive, +1.0)**: Correct Python dict keys and types (sets of tuples for relations, dict of sets for `activ_freq`). Syntax is valid despite inline comments.
- **Logical Accuracy (catastrophic failure, -7.0)**:
  - **always_before/always_after completely reversed**: Per definition, `(A, B)` in `always_before` means *if A occurs, B before A*; `(A, B)` in `always_after` means *if A occurs, B after A*. The main chain (e.g., `('RO', 'CA')` in `always_before`) wrongly implies CA *before* RO, inverting the obvious RO  CA  ...  D sequence. `always_after` mirrors this reversal (e.g., `('CA', 'RO')` implies RO *after* CA). This renders the core model nonsensical and unusable.
  - **Invoicing/payment contradictions**: `('RO', 'IC')` in `always_before` implies IC before RO (absurd); comment explicitly says "after". `('PO', 'IC')` in `always_before` implies IC before PO, but comment says "after packing". `always_after` has reciprocal errors (e.g., `('IC', 'PO')`). Self-contradictory comments expose flawed reasoning.
  - **Incomplete/inaccurate modeling**: No transitive constraints (e.g., no `('D', 'RO')` in `always_before`). IC/RP loosely tied but wrongly placed; scenario implies IC possibly parallel/post-D, not strictly after PO or before anything illogical. No equivalence despite potential (e.g., none obvious, but empty is neutral).
- **activ_freq (partial credit, +1.0)**: Reasonable bounds (exactly once for core steps, RP optional). Covers all 10 activities. Minor nit: `{1}` vs `{0,1}` for non-optional is fine, but scenario implies strict once per case—no multiples allowed, correct.
- **never_together/equivalence (neutral, +0.5)**: Empty sets appropriate (no co-occurrence bans or equivalents evident).
- **directly_follows (weak, +0.5)**: Only 2 pairs; logical for tight coupling (POGSLD), but under-specifies (e.g., no RIPI, PIQC). Comments admit conservatism but don't justify incompleteness.
- **Clarity/Unclarities (penalty, -1.0)**: Comments contradict code/logic (e.g., "after" but coded "before"). No explanation for choices (e.g., why IC after PO?). Overly verbose comments clutter without aiding.
- **Completeness (penalty, -1.0)**: Misses holistic model (e.g., no `always_before ('D', 'GSL')`; weak parallelism for IC branch). Scenario demands full declarative capture—fails.

**Overall**: Intent grasps linear flow, but inverted constraints make it fundamentally broken/invertible only by swapping entire sets (not minor fix). Equivalent to a reversed flowchart. Not "nearly flawless"—unusable as-is. Strict deduction yields low score.
