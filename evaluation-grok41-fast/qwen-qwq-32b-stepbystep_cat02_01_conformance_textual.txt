**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**:
  - **Correct Identification (Flawless)**: Accurately flags Cases 2, 3, and 5 as violating; correctly clears Cases 1 and 4. Summary of violating cases and key violations is precise and matches normative rules without error.
  - **Core Explanations Reference Norm Well**: Ties violations directly to textual constraints (e.g., Authorize before Package; no fulfillment post-Cancel; Package required between Authorize and Ship). Handles Case 3's logical contradiction (Authorize implying sufficient inventory, yet Cancel later) insightfully, resolving process branching ambiguity correctly as a strict post-Check fork.
  - **Structure and Clarity**: Logical case-by-case breakdown with sequences, bullet-point violations, and concise summary. No missed violations (e.g., all cases start with Receive/Check properly; Close is final everywhere).
  - **Final Conclusions**: Summary distills accurately without carrying forward flaws—focuses on reversal (Case 2), post-Cancel Ship (Case 3), missing Package (Case 5).

- **Weaknesses (Deductions for Strictness)**:
  - **Inaccuracy in Case 2 (Significant, -1.0)**: Violation 2 claims **"Missing 'Package items' before 'Ship order'"**, which is false—Package *occurs* (at 10:00), just out-of-order (before Authorize). This mischaracterizes as absence rather than misplacement, contradicting the log. Follow-up ("less severe... between authorization and shipping") adds confusion, implying a separate issue when it's the *same* order violation (Package not *after* Authorize). Logical flaw in analysis body, even if summary avoids it.
  - **Redundancy in Case 3 (-0.3)**: Violation 3 ("Unauthorized 'Ship order' post-cancel... only step after cancellation") repeats Violation 2 verbatim; unnecessary bloat reduces precision.
  - **Minor Imprecision in Case 2 Violation 1 (-0.3)**: "`Check Package Authorize` *skips* the required authorization step *before* packaging"—accurate but phrasing "skips" slightly blurs (they *did* Authorize, just late); hypercritically, could say "performs packaging *without prior* authorization."
  - **No Over-Interpretation**: Handles ambiguities (e.g., no "extraordinary circumstances" for Case 3 Cancel-after-Authorize) correctly, but doesn't explicitly note *no Package ever in Case 3/5* as extra violation (minor omission, as covered implicitly).
  - **Overall Polish (-0.2)**: Verbose bullets; Case 2's "though this is less severe" introduces subjective severity not in task.

- **Why Not Higher/Lower?**: Nearly flawless conclusions (9.5+ territory), but body inaccuracies/unclarities prevent "very high" (10.0 requires zero issues). Not lower (e.g., 7.x) as core logic/task fulfillment is robust—no wrong cases flagged, all explanations norm-referenced. 8.2 reflects ~82% perfection under hypercriticism.
