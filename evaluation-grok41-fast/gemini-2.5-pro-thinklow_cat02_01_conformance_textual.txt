**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
This answer is excellent overall—clear structure, accurate identification of all violating cases (2, 3, 5), precise sequence listings, strong referencing to the normative description with direct quotes, logical interpretations of ambiguities (e.g., "directly proceed" implying exclusive paths, packaging as mandatory prerequisite), and bonus completeness with conformant cases. Explanations are detailed, focused, and violation-specific without fluff. No unclarities, no logical flaws in reasoning, no incorrect conformant/deviant classifications. All timestamps implicitly respected as sequential.

**Minor Deductions (strictly applied, preventing 10.0):**
- **Case 3 incompleteness (0.5 deduction):** Lists two violations correctly (Ship after Cancel; path mixing including Auth-then-Cancel deviation from "directly proceed to Cancel"). However, omits explicit "Ship order" without prior "Package items," violating the constraint "'Ship order' should only occur after packaging" (separate from "never after cancellation"). This is referenced generally in the description but not flagged here, despite being listed distinctly in Case 5. Hypercritical: incomplete violation enumeration in a "multiple violations" section.
- **Case 3 secondary (0.3 deduction):** Path mixing is well-described but could more explicitly tie Auth (fulfillment-only per "only makes sense once inventory sufficiency known") to violating the insufficient-inventory branch's "directly proceed," rather than subsuming it. Minor interpretive shortfall.

No other issues: no factual errors, no overinterpretation, no missed cases, perfect fidelity to text. Near-flawless; deductions are for precision only.
