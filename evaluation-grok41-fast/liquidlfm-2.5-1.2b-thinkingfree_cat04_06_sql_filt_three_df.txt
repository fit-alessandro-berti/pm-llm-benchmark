The provided answer's final conclusions (multiple attempted SQL queries labeled "Final Answer") are syntactically invalid DuckDB SQL (e.g., impossible `AND a.activity = 'X' AND a.activity = 'Y'` conditions on the same table alias without joins or grouping, nonsensical `TIMESTAMPTZ` invocations like `TIMESTAMPTZ('now') - TIMESTAMPTZ('start_time') * 86400`, malformed `EXTRACT(DAY FROM ...)` with undefined references like `a.timestamp` outside scope, unbalanced parentheses, and invented non-functions like `TIMESTAMPTOW` or `NETWORK_TIMESTAMPTZ`). 

Logically, it fails entirely:
- No implementation of "direct succession/consecutive" (requires per-case row ordering via `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)` or `LAG()` to verify adjacent activities with no intervening events; EXISTS merely checks presence of all three activities somewhere in the case, ignoring order and gaps).
- Time condition is broken (no correlated subquery to fetch/join timestamps of specific 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events in sequence, compute `confirm.timestamp - create.timestamp > INTERVAL '5' DAY`; instead, vague/erroneous day extraction).
- Wrong output: Returns `case_id` rows (duplicates all events per case), not "all events from `event_log`" (`SELECT *` filtered by `case_id NOT IN (...)`).
- Wrong filter logic: Attempts to select cases *with* (flawed) sequence *and* some <=5-day condition, but prompt requires excluding cases *with* valid sequence *and* >5 days, returning *all events* from non-matching cases.
- No grouping/ordering as hinted ("proper grouping, ordering, and filtering"); ignores full event return.

Zero requirements met correctly; equivalent to non-functional pseudocode.
