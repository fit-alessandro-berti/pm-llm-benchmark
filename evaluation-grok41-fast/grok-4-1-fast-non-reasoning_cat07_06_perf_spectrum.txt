**9.1/10.0**

### Rationale:
- **Strengths (excellent overall)**:
  - **Chart type & structure**: Perfectly identifies as stacked Sankey/alluvial (10/10). Accurately describes time axis divisions and progression (10/10).
  - **Visual pattern & dynamics**: Nailed the core story—thick upper gray flows persisting dominantly (~90-95% volume stable), thin pink/red downward flows (failures) starting minimal and growing sharply in weeks 3-4 (~5%  20%+), no upward recovery. Proportions and trend are spot-on visually (10/10).
  - **Interpretation**: Insightful and contextually apt (notification/email delivery degradation, causes like bounces/API limits, alerting value). Actionable and professional (10/10).
  
- **Weaknesses (minor deductions)**:
  - **State labeling**: Table simplifies to 2 states (top "Send Fail" large gray, bottom "Send Success" small gray), but image shows 3 stacked levels per column: top **Send Fail** (thick gray), middle **Insert Notification** (thin gray), bottom **Insert Fail** (pink inflows). Bottom misnamed as "Send Success" (ignores "Insert"); pink flows correctly noted as failures but tied to "Send Fail" instead of "Insert Fail" (-0.4).
  - **Minor internal inconsistency**: Describes upper gray as "**Send Success** persisting" despite table calling top "Send Fail"—suggests possible label swap/misread, but dynamics still align visually (-0.3).
  - **Completeness**: Misses "Send Cohort" start node and "Insert" stage nuance, but doesn't detract from flow analysis (-0.2).

High score reflects **strong analytical value**: fully conveys the viz's key insight (degrading reliability trend) with precise visuals/trends, despite label simplifications. Ideal for dashboards/alerts.
