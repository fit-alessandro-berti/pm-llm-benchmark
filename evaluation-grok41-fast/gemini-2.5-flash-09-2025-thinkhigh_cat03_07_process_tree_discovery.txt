**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Fitness (perfect: +2.5/2.5)**: The model replays all observed traces flawlessly. Case 2: silents allow AE  AD directly. Case 1: single RMI+ (RMI  )  VF. Case 3: RMI    RMI    VF. Initial RA  VF  AE and final AD  SC  AC always mandatory. No blocking.
- **Precision (moderate flaw: +1.2/2.5)**: Major inaccuracy—allows unobserved and semantically implausible traces like `AE  RMI(s)  VF  RMI(s)  VF  AD` (e.g., `...VF RMI...`), implying re-validation (VF) fails immediately after completion, triggering new RMI. Log has **zero** instances of VF  RMI (initial VF  AE; re-VF  AD always). This direct succession violates observed behavior (no post-VF rework restarts). Inner RMI+ allows 3 RMI (unobserved beyond 2), minor overgeneralization. Log suggests **at most one** rework block, not repeatable.
- **Simplicity (moderate flaw: +1.3/2.5)**: Unnecessarily complex—double-nested loops (* outer for blocks, * inner for RMI+). Equivalent XOR(, (RMI+, 'VF')) post-AE is simpler, precise, fits log perfectly without multiple blocks or VFRMI. Extra 's add unneeded silent interleaving (harmless but verbose). Subcomponent definitions redundant in final structure.
- **Clarity/Completeness (minor flaws: +1.2/2.5)**: Notation correct (uses  leaf, proper operators, nested ). Descriptive text accurate for model but assumes unobserved repeatability ("repeat the rework block"), misleading vs. log. Final structure clear but inline redefinition of P_Loop slightly unclear/repetitive. No code (good). Captures "repetitions of RMI" well, but "re-validation" over-repeated.
- **Logical Flaws/Unobserved Assumptions (- deductions embedded)**: Assumes repeatable full rework (L) despite no evidence (all cases: 1 block). VFRMI enabled via  silent (behaviorally unseen). Hypergeneralizes beyond "balancing" for small log.

**Total: 7.2**. Strong fitness, but precision/simplicity flaws (unneeded multi-block, VFRMI) prevent >8. Flawless alternative: replace P_Loop with `X ( \tau, \rightarrow ( \rightarrow ( 'RMI', * (\tau, 'RMI') ), 'VF' ) )` (+2.0 precision/simplicity).
