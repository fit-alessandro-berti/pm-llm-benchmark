**8.5**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (Supporting High Score):**
- **Final Output Excellence:** The table is a clear, professional, enriched log with **all attributes integrated** (timestamps from both, originals preserved via `event_type_A/B`, B's rich fields like `user_id`/`notes`, `source` indicator). Chronological order uses a logical primary (Log A ts for A-involved events, Log B for B-only), aligning with "Log A primary timeline" and "chosen primary timestamp." 7 events correctly reflect 5A + 5B - 3 merges.
- **Matching Logic:** Sensibly aligns on `order_id` + timing + semantic similarity (e.g., names like "Payment Processed"/"PaymentCheck" considered but rejected at 5s > tolerance). Handles uniques perfectly (Quality Check B-only, Item Delivered A-only). Merges include **both timestamps** as required.
- **Reasoning Documentation:** Comprehensive—strategy, per-event decisions, mappings, sorting rule, tolerance rationale. Conflicts (e.g., 5s Payment gap) explicitly resolved. Traces origins, no over-merging.
- **Corrections from <think>:** Ignores verbose/repetitive planning; final is polished, self-consistent.

**Flaws (Deductions - Strict/Hypercritical):**
- **Tolerance Inaccuracy (-0.5):** Prompt specifies "**less than 2 seconds**" (strict <2s). Answer uses "**inclusive** 2s" (matches exact 2s diffs: Order Received, Item Shipped). Minor deviation (prompt uses "e.g."), but logical flaw—could exclude those matches under strict rules, altering output. Justified post-hoc, but not flawless adherence.
- **Summary Factual Error (-1.0):** "**5 matched events** [...] **4 unmatched**" is wrong. Table shows **3 "A and B"** (matched) + **4 separate** ("A"/"B"). Math inconsistent (5+4=9 vs. actual 7 events); undermines credibility. Glaring despite strong table/reasoning.
- **Unclarities/Minors (-0.0 net):** "—" for None is readable but not explicit (e.g., "None"); table headers perfect otherwise. No unified `event_type` (good preservation, but prompt implies "unified records"). Payment 5s non-merge defensible ("few seconds" contextual, but tolerance-bound), no penalty. No overkill (e.g., no false matches).

**Why Not Higher/Lower?** Nearly flawless execution (structure, completeness, utility >90%), but errors prevent 9.5-10 (strict: "inaccuracies [...] significantly lower"). Beats 7.x (comprehensive > superficial). Equivalent to A- paper: excellent but not error-free.
