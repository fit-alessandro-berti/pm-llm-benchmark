9.0

### Reasoning for Grade:
- **Strengths (flawless aspects)**:
  - The SQL query is logically correct and precisely fulfills the requirements: CTE correctly groups by `case_id`, uses `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to filter cases with six or fewer events, joins back to retrieve all events (`e.*`) for qualifying cases only, and preserves the full row set per the prompt.
  - Efficient structure (CTE + join avoids redundant full scans in most optimizers; DuckDB handles this well).
  - `ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp` is a nice, unrequested but helpful addition for readability, leveraging known columns without assumptions.
  - Returns exactly the "full set of events" for valid cases, no extras or misses.

- **Weaknesses (deductions for strict/hypercritical evaluation)**:
  - **Inaccuracy in explanation (major clarity/logical flaw, -0.5)**: Point 1 states "filters to keep only cases with 6 events", but the query (correctly) keeps cases with **six or fewer** (`<= 6`). This mismatches the prompt's "six or fewer" and misdescribes the `HAVING` clause, potentially confusing readers into thinking it's exactly 6. Even though the code is right, the explanation has a factual error.
  - **Minor unnecessities (-0.3)**: `event_count` alias in CTE is unused (harmless but redundant). Efficiency claim ("without scanning the full table multiple times") is optimistic but not guaranteed (CTE may materialize, scanning ~2x; a `WHERE case_id IN (...)` subquery could be more optimal in some engines). Not flaws, but hypercritical nitpicks.
  - **Minor unclarity (-0.2)**: Explanation calls `ORDER BY` "optional but recommended" without tying to prompt (which doesn't require it), slightly extraneous.

- **Overall**: Nearly flawless query elevates score, but explanation inaccuracies/unclarities prevent 10.0 (not "nearly flawless" per instructions). Equivalent subquery alternatives exist but aren't required. 9.0 reflects excellence with strict deductions for minors.
