The provided answer is flawless: it precisely meets every requirement with correct SQL semantics, efficient CTE structure, deterministic top-K selection (via secondary sort on `variant_sequence` for ties), exact filtering to return only events from top-K variant cases, preservation of original event details via `e.*`, and a sensible final `ORDER BY`. The parameterization of `{{top_k}}` is appropriate and practical. The explanation is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the steps. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, inefficiencies, assumptions beyond the spec, or deviations—even minor ones. DuckDB compatibility is ensured (e.g., `string_agg` with `ORDER BY`).
