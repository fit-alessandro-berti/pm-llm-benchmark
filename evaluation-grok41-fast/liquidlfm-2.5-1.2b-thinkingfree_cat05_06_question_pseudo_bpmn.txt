**6.2**

### Justification (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: Exactly 20 questions, all open-ended ("How" or "What" starters), no SQL or extraneous content, clean numbered list format matching "just list the questions." Broadly touches required categories (e.g., #4/#6/#14 on risk; #3/#13 on decision-making/performance; #5/#18/#19 on communication; #1/#5/#7/#9/#12/#17/#20 on improvements/rationale).
- **Major Flaws (strict deductions)**:
  - **Lack of specificity to BPMN flows (primary inaccuracy, -2.0)**: Questions are generic supply-chain platitudes, not "delv[ing] deeper into the rationale behind the **process flows**." Ignores diagram uniques like parallel component sourcing (Taiwan/Japan/Korea/Germany-USA), Malaysia assembly (24/7), quality rework loop, air/ship split, VIP/direct shipments, regional DCs (Europe/N. America/Asia/LatAm), or forecast-based exclusive gateway. E.g., no probe on *why* parallels/exclusives exist, *why* those countries/plants/markets, or loop rationale. #12 vaguely nods "parallel workflows" but doesn't delve.
  - **Uneven/incomplete topic coverage (unclarity, -0.8)**: Rationale shallow (e.g., #1 generic "misalignment"); performance measurement weak (#13 only); misses deep stakeholder comms (e.g., no supplier/retailer/customs specifics). Off-topic drifts (#10 ethics, #11 decentralization, #15 culture – tangential, not core to flows).
  - **Logical flaws/redundancy (minor but penalized heavily, -0.7)**: Repetitive themes (feedback in #5/#9/#19; disruptions #6/#14; quality #2/#16/#17). Some unclear/vague (#8 "unseen compliance," #20 "evolving market" – what markets?). Not maximally thought-provoking; could be sharper (e.g., #7 sustainability unlinked to diagram).
  - **Overall**: Competent but superficial/not "thought-provoking" re: given BPMN. Not "nearly flawless" – specificity gap is a core miss, warranting mid-range score.
