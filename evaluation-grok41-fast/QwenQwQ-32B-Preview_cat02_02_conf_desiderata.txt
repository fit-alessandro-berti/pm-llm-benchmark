**6.0**

### Explanation of Grade (for transparency, not part of response):
- **Strengths (supporting mid-high score)**: Correctly identifies Case 1 as fully compliant with normative rules. Accurately flags Case 2 as the only normative violator and Case 3 as normative-compliant. Lists two correct normative violations for Case 2 (order reversal, inappropriate finalization after rejection). Correctly identifies Case 3 desiderata failures (timings) and clarifies they are not serious/suboptimal. Provides brief interpretations/justifications as required. Ignores initial verbose reasoning per instructions, focuses on conclusions/summary.
- **Weaknesses (preventing higher score, hypercritical evaluation)**: Major inaccuracy—completely misses that Case 2 skips the strict "Inform Applicant" step entirely (listed in log analysis but not flagged as violation, despite "must be informed" and sequence rules prohibiting skips). This is a core normative violation ("Skipping activities..."), making explanation of reasons incomplete (2/3 violations noted). Dismisses Case 3's no Follow-up Call as "not a problem" instead of identifying as desiderata failure and noting as suboptimal (per task 2 wording). Fails to note desiderata failures across all cases (no Follow-up Call absent in logs for any case, representing suboptimal behavior). Lazy final boxed answer ("See analysis above") lacks structured 1-2-3 response mirroring task. Minor unclarity in Case 3 timing recap (misstates app date initially). These are significant logical flaws/incompletenesses under strict criteria—no "nearly flawless" for 9-10.
