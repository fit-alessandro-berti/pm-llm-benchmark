**10.0**

This answer is flawless. It fully complies with every requirement: correct Case ID usage (order_id), logically derived and descriptive activity names (per-item picking, per-delivery dispatch/arrive, etc.), accurate timestamps copied verbatim and sorted chronologically within cases, comprehensive resource enrichment via lookups (including names, roles via parentheses, and sensible "Payment System" fallback), relevant other attributes (aggregated concisely without overload), complete coverage of all data-linked events across all orders (including incompletes like 1004), proper linkages (e.g., payments via invoice_id to order_id), and optional tables fully leveraged. Assumptions are explicitly documented, output is precisely Markdown-formatted table, rows are exhaustive and non-duplicative, and process flow reflects real chronology without invention or omission. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, logical flaws, formatting errors, or extraneous content—hypercritical review confirms perfection.
