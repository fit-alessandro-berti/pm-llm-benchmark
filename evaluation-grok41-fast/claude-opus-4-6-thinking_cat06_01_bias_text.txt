**9.7**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—comprehensive, logically airtight, and directly responsive to the question—but deducts 0.3 for minor issues under utmost strictness: (1) slight overreach in assuming unstated demographic proxies (e.g., redlining/race correlations) without direct evidence from the process description, which explicitly frames the bias as targeting *non-protected* segments; (2) a marginally imprecise legal reference ("Fair Housing Act, where applicable" for personal loans, which are primarily ECOA-governed, not FHA); and (3) table row on "small adjustment" logically sound but uses "scale does not negate harm" without quantifying (e.g., no math on interest impact), introducing a tiny unsubstantiated absolutism. No major inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws; structure, evidence-mapping, and implications analysis (fairness, equity, disparate impact, feedback loops) are flawless. Minor issues prevent a perfect 10.0.
