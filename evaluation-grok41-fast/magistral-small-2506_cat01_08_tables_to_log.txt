**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**:
  - Correct case ID usage (`order_id`).
  - All *actual* events accurately derived and included: "Order Created" (5 events), "Items Picked" (5 summarized events), all deliveries as separate "Order Dispatched"/"Order Arrived" (10 events), all "Invoice Issued" (5 events), all "Payment Received" (5 events).
  - Perfect linking via keys (e.g., payments via `invoice_id`  `order_id`; deliveries via `order_id`).
  - Timestamps 100% accurate for real events, with chronological order preserved within each case (verified all sequences, e.g., 1002's split deliveries and invoices post-arrivals).
  - Logical activity names matching prompt examples.
  - Excellent enrichment: "Other Attributes" includes relevant details (customer type, items lists, notes, amounts, methods).
  - Resources/Actors appropriately mapped (sales person for created, picker for picked—earliest consistent with assumption, carrier for deliveries, billing for invoices, "(System)" for payments).
  - Multiple events handled correctly (e.g., 1002's 2 deliveries, 2 invoices, 2 payments as separate rows).
  - Markdown table format correct, readable grouping by case.
  - Assumptions documented (aggregation rule, placeholders rationale).
  - Covers all 5 `order_id`s with existing events.

- **Flaws (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Major inaccuracy (placeholders for 1004)**: Invented 4 non-existent event rows ("Order Dispatched", "Order Arrived", "Invoice Issued", "Payment Received") with invalid text in **Timestamp** column (e.g., "(No delivery data for 1004)"), violating "Timestamp: A date/time field" and "one row per event". Event logs for process mining *only* include real events; placeholders pollute the log, break chronological/sortability, and mislead (e.g., implies activities occurred). Prompt requires documenting missing data, *not* fabricating rows. (-2.0; core logical flaw, makes log unusable as-is despite notes).
  - **Picking aggregation issues**: Summarization allowed, but earliest timestamp/single resource loses granularity (e.g., 1001 has 2 pickers/timestamps 30min apart; assigns only WH-001). Process flow better reflected by latest (completion) or per-item events per prompt ("event(s)", "produce one per activity if meaningful"). Simplification "for simplicity" unconvincing vs. data richness. (-0.5).
  - **Minor format/precision issues**: Column header "Case ID (order_id)"  "Case ID" (prompt spec). Payment rows don't link specific invoice/method explicitly in attributes (inferred ok, but unclarified). No global sort by Case ID + Timestamp (grouped ok for readability, but strict event log expects it). (-0.3).
  - **Unnecessary incompleteness handling**: Notes suggest excluding placeholders "in practice", but included anyway—inconsistent. No use of optional tables (Products/Resources names) despite "enrich" recommendation, sticking to IDs only. (-0.2).

Nearly flawless except placeholders (fatal for strict process mining suitability) and aggregation nitpicks; 10.0 requires zero inventions/invalids. 7.0 reflects ~85% perfection with heavy penalty for key violations.
