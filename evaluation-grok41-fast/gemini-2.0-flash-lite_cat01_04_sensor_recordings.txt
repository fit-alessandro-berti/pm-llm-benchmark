**8.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**:
  - **Comprehensive coverage**: All 15 events are grouped with no omissions or overlaps. Cycles back to idle logically.
  - **Pattern identification**: Excellent detection of distinct phases based on changes (e.g., temp/vib ramps in 4-6, spike in 9, steady low in 11-12). Transitions noted implicitly via sequential grouping.
  - **Intuitive labels**: Align well with prompt examples ("Cutting," "Assembling," "Welding"); creative but plausible extensions like "Forming/Shaping/Deburring" fit sensor shifts.
  - **Structure**: Clear numbered list with per-sensor bullets + summary table exceeds basic requirements. Rationales tie sensors to activities logically most places (e.g., high temp/vib/energy = cutting/welding).
  - **Overall logic**: Sequence forms coherent process (idle  cut  form  weld  cool  assemble  idle). Energy/tool position trends support progression.

- **Inaccuracies/Flaws (deducting 2.0 points total)**:
  - **Major factual error (deduct 1.0)**: Welding rationale explicitly states "**Material Flow:** A consistent flow indicates the process is underway." But Event 9 flow = **0** (not consistent with prior 2-5 units/s; it's a drop to zero). This misrepresents data, undermining claim that flow supports inference. (Table omits this, but detailed rationale is primary.)
  - **Minor logical/accuracy issues (deduct 0.5 each, total 1.0)**:
    - Forming rationale: "**Material Flow:** Reduced or consistent flow, **suggesting material is being used to shape**." Flow=2 is reduced (from 5), but "material being used" is vague/unsubstantiated—could be residue, not active shaping; temp drop (5840) better fits cooling than active forming.
    - Welding single-event grouping: High spike justifies isolation, but rationale ignores pressure steady at 2 (no change noted); flow error compounds.
    - Assembly: Calls flow "**Increased**" (true, 01), but vib=5 (higher than idle's 0) and tool shift to 20 could fit "Quality Inspection" better than assembly (low energy/flow too passive for parts assembly).
  - **Unclarities (minor deducts embedded above)**: Some rationales generic ("strong indicator," "suggests the part being worked on") without quantifying thresholds (e.g., vib>30=high?). No explicit transition analysis (e.g., tool position progression 01015200).

- **Why not higher/lower?**: Nearly flawless structure/logic (9+ base), but data misread + vague ties prevent "very high." Not 10.0 (not flawless). Not below 8.0 (errors isolated, not systemic; groupings/overall deduction sound). Strict but proportional.
