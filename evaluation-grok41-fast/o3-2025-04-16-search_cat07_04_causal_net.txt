This answer is exemplary: fully accurate, comprehensive, and insightful. It precisely labels all elements (activities a-z), correctly interprets the Petri-net-style token semantics, routing behaviors (e.g., OR-split after 'a' to b/c/d, AND-sync before 'e', XOR at 'e'), loops, and legend patterns. The structure is clear (numbered sections, bullets), pedagogically effective (explains "token game" reading), and includes a relevant source link. No omissions, errors, or fluff—perfect match to the C-net image.
