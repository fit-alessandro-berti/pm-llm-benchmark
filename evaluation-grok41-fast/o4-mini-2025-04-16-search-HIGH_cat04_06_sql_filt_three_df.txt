### Evaluation Rationale
**Strengths (leading to high base score):**
- **Sequence detection is flawless (10/10):** Uses `LEAD(1)` and `LEAD(2)` over `PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp` to precisely identify *direct succession* (consecutive rows with no intervening events). Filters correctly on the exact 3-activity pattern starting from 'Approve Purchase Requisition'. Handles cases with multiple sequences or events correctly via `DISTINCT case_id`.
- **Overall structure perfect (10/10):** CTE isolates flagged cases cleanly. Outer query correctly excludes *all events* from flagged cases using `NOT IN`. Returns precisely what's required: all events from non-matching cases.
- **DuckDB compatibility (10/10):** Syntax is idiomatic (window functions, `date_diff`, `LEAD(offset)`). Efficient (no unnecessary joins/grouping).
- **Ordering and presentation (10/10):** Final `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` ensures deterministic, logical output (matches event log norms, even if not strictly required).
- **Explanation comprehensive and accurate (9/10):** Step-by-step breakdown mirrors code logic, highlights key concepts (e.g., "direct succession" via LEAD). Minor typo ("(-5+day)").

**Fatal flaw (major deduction: -2.0):**
- **Time condition logic is incorrect/inaccurate:** `date_diff('day', next_ts, next2_ts) > 5` computes `floor((next2_ts - next_ts) / '1 day') > 5`, which only flags if elapsed >= ~6 days (floor >=6). This misses cases where 5 < elapsed < 6 days (e.g., Create Order at '2023-01-01 00:00', Confirm at '2023-01-06 12:00'  ~5.5 days, floor=5 5  incorrectly *not flagged*  events wrongly included).
  - "Time elapsed ... more than 5 days" requires continuous timestamp comparison: `next2_ts > next_ts + INTERVAL '5 days'` (exact >120h).
  - `date_diff('day')` is imprecise (time-of-day sensitive, floor truncation); fails on test cases with partial days. Logical error affects result correctness.

**Minor issues (small deductions: -0.5 total):**
- Explanation assumes discrete "days" implicitly match `date_diff`, but doesn't note precision loss.
- No handling for timestamp ties (arbitrary order if `timestamp` equal); minor, as prompt assumes proper ordering, but hypercritical note.
- No explicit assumption on `timestamp` uniqueness/strict monotonicity per `case_id`.

**Overall:** Excellent, innovative solution (window peeking is elegant/efficient). Single major logical inaccuracy prevents "nearly flawless" (9.5+). Hypercritical strictness docks heavily for result-altering flaw, but structure merits >5.0. Equivalent to production-ready with 1-line fix.
