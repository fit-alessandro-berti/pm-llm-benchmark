The provided answer outputs a query that returns only aggregated `case_id` and `count` summaries for qualifying cases, not "the full set of events" (i.e., all original rows including `activity`, `timestamp`, etc.) as explicitly required. This fails the core task: it excludes events entirely instead of returning them. The explanation compounds the error by claiming it "returns only events from processes," which is false—it returns no events, only aggregates. No subquery, CTE, window function, or join is used to fetch the full rows, rendering the solution logically invalid and incomplete.
