**10.0**

The final process tree structure is precise, fits all observed traces perfectly (Case 1: single RMI + VF; Case 2: tau skip; Case 3: RMI + tau(silent) + RMI + VF yielding consecutive observable RMI+RMI+VF), balances fitness (replays log exactly), precision (blocks invalid orders like AD before loop exit or VF without RMI entry; no overgeneralization), and simplicity (minimal nesting: one XOR for optionality, one loop for RMI repetition via tau-hiding, one sequence for block). Notation is clear and operator-consistent despite word wrappers (maps directly to ->/X/*/tau); no code; captures exact requirements (main sequence, optional repeating RMI+re-VF loop, final steps). No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws.
