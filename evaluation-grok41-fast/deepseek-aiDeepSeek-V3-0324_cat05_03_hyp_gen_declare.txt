**4.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies (35% weight: Major flaws, -2.5 pts)**: Fails to identify the core contradiction: `existence(C=1.0)` + `noncoexistence(E,C=1.0)` forbids *any* E in traces (since every trace must have C); combined with `responded_existence` (correctly interpretable as AE, i.e., every A requires subsequent E), this forbids *any* A too—directly undermining intended flow (RAE...C). Answer misinterprets `responded_existence` as "if E then prior A" (precedence, opposite direction) and dilutes noncoexistence to "potential violations" without noting absolute impossibility. Secondary points (missing EP, NC) valid but peripheral; `init` critique vague/unsubstantiated. Logical flaws and incompleteness.
- **Hypotheses (25% weight: Adequate but superficial, -0.8 pts)**: Matches prompt examples generically but untethered to core anomaly (e.g., no hypothesis on why noncoexistence(E,C) exists despite intended E-before-C). Lacks depth tying to model contradictions.
- **Verification Approaches (30% weight: Inaccurate/mismatched, -1.5 pts)**: SQL queries syntactically valid for PostgreSQL but logically flawed/misaligned:
  | Query | Issue |
  |-------|-------|
  | 1 | Checks C without E (model *allows* this via no `existence(E)`; tests intended flow, not model anomaly). |
  | 2 | Correctly checks noncoexistence violation (E+C coexist). |
  | 3 | Checks precedence (A before *every* E)—wrong for `responded_existence(AE)`; should find A without subsequent E (violation: `EXISTS A AND NOT EXISTS E after`). Timestamp logic ignores multi-occurrences. |
  | 4 | Minor: Assumes single "last" C via `MAX`; fails if multiple C/N interleaved. Doesn't check model (no N constraint exists). |
  No query for core contradiction (e.g., A without E, or E anywhere since C exists). Misses adjusters integration (e.g., `resource` matching `adjusters`). Prompt examples partially hit, but execution poor.
- **Overall Structure/Clarity (10% weight: Strong, -0.0 pts)**: Well-formatted, independent presentation. No hints leaked.
- **Strict Adjustments**: -1.0 pt for pervasive DECLARE misinterpretation; -0.5 pt for unclarities (e.g., anomaly 1's "implies E before C" ignores noncoexistence semantics). Total deductions yield 4.2/10—functional but fundamentally inaccurate/flawed.
