The provided answer is flawless. It correctly identifies and groups all 18 events into exactly three distinct cases using the unique patient demographics (age + gender) as the primary key, with impeccable validation via chronological timestamps, logical activity sequences, department consistency, resource continuity (e.g., Dr. Smith for Case B, Dr. Lee for Case C), and semantic links in `additional_info` (e.g., leg X-ray to fracture diagnosis, blood panel to infection/antibiotics, knee surgery details). No events are missed, duplicated, or misassigned. Narratives are precise, evidence-based, and demonstrate deep understanding of hospital workflows. Structure is exemplary (clear labeling, bulleted events with key attributes, rationales). Zero inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws.
