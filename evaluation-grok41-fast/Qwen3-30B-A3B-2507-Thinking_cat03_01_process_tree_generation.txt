**9.0**

The final code and structural notes accurately capture the entire process description with perfect conceptual mapping:
- Correct sequential flow for initial steps (A  RG  IA  (TI  TC)).
- Correct XOR for initial diagnostics (CE X FBP).
- Correct loop modeling as * (loop_body, tau), where loop_body = SC  (TM X SPT)  (FCE X FBA), enabling 1+ iterations with silent exit—matches the operator semantics and "repeat until normal" requirement without extra activities.
- Correct parallel for AI + NC.
- Correct sequence for FAS  DDI.
- Correct nested parallel for BL + (ICP + MRF).
- All listed activities used exactly, no extras/missing; RDT correctly as XOR subtree (not leaf).

The code follows the example style, uses proper operators (SEQUENCE, XOR, LOOP, PARALLEL), and includes tau as leaf.

**Minor deductions (hypercritical review):**
- Missing explicit `loop_body.parent = loop_node` and `tau.parent = loop_node` after `loop_node.children = [loop_body, tau]`. Per prompt's explicit warning ("Their parent should be explicitly set [...] Otherwise, it does not work"), this creates parent-child inconsistency for loop_node's children (they remain `parent=root`). All other parents are correctly set/reassigned (e.g., `TI.parent = triage_seq`, `AI.parent = adv_conc`). This is a construction flaw, though the children lists are correct and tree likely traversable.
- No other inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws; notes are precise/crisp; nesting handles >2 parallels correctly; symbolic matches (e.g., ->, X, +, *).

Nearly flawless (structure/semantics perfect), but parent omission violates prompt's core construction rule—strictly penalized to 9.0 rather than 10.0.
