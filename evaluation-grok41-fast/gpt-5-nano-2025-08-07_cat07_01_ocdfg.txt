**10.0**

The provided answer is exceptionally accurate, comprehensive, and insightful. It precisely identifies:
- All top-level inputs with exact volume counts (e.g., 2.0M PurchaseRequisitionItem).
- Parallel streams and key process steps (e.g., Create/Approve Requisition, Create Order  Pack/Ship/Confirm/Close, Invoice/Payment/Return paths), matching the diagram's nodes.
- "Overall" counts in boxes (e.g., 3.0M), edge timings in milliseconds (e.g., 200ms, 500ms), multiple End nodes, color-coded lanes (with a logical interpretation).
- High-level context (procure-to-pay + order-to-cash lifecycle, throughput/timing overview).

No omissions, inaccuracies, or extraneous details—it's a near-perfect distillation of the diagram.
