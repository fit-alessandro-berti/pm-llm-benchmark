**2.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Code and Explanation Only):
- **Missing Key Elements**: No `Transition` for "Service Request (SR)" verification, explicitly stated as the process start. D&R entirely absent despite being core to the looped phase ("BNC followed by optional D&R"). LOOP modeled with only `[BNC]`; POWL LOOP requires **two children** (`*(A, B)`: A=BNC first, B=D&R optional reconfig), per definition/example. Fatal incompleteness.
- **Invalid POWL API Usage**: `OperatorPOWL.children` is **immutable post-constructor** ("cannot be modified afterward"). Code illegally appends `loop_node.children.append(xor_node)`, `xor_node.children.append(qa_sa_order)` — breaks model construction, renders code non-executable/invalid.
- **Incorrect Sequencing/Chaining**: Uses `.children.append()` chaining (e.g., `CS.children.append(...)`), but `Transition` lacks mutable `children` (leaves). `StrictPartialOrder` uses `nodes=` in ctor + `.order.add_edge(source, target)` for dependencies, not appends. No top-level/root `StrictPartialOrder` wrapping all (as in example); chain implies wrong semantics (e.g., `qa_sa_order.children.append(gla_node)` adds GLA concurrent to QA/SA, violating "both QA/SA before GLA" — needs `order.add_edge(QA, GLA); order.add_edge(SA, GLA)`).
- **Wrong Dependencies**: After CS, DA/ACI PO correct (concurrent), but post-loop XOR lacks proper predecessor edge. QA/SA PO lacks edges to enforce GLA sequencing. No silent transitions (e.g., for loop exit/skip D&R).
- **Explanation Mismatches Reality**: Claims "LOOP between BNC" (false, ignores D&R); "XOR follows successful loop completion" (unmodeled); assumes appends enforce order (they don't). Labels abbreviated inconsistently (e.g., "DA" vs. full scenario names).
- **Overall Fidelity**: Captures ~40% structure (DA/ACI PO, XOR, QA/SA PO) but core loop/sequencing fatally broken. Non-flawless = major deduction; executable/inaccurate = low score. Equivalent to broken pseudocode.
