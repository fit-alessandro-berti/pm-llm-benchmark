### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—comprehensive, structured, evidence-based, and directly responsive—but deducts a minor 0.3 for two hypercritical issues: (1) slight overextension in labeling Step 5 as a point of *introduction* of bias (it more accurately *propagates/operationalizes* prior biases, per the question's "where ... introduced" phrasing, creating a minor logical imprecision); (2) the phrase "lazy stereotyping" in point 5 of the discussion introduces a subtly pejorative tone that, while arguably supported by the text's "perceived (though not formally proven)" caveat, risks veering from purely analytical neutrality without explicit textual anchoring. No factual inaccuracies, unclarities, or major flaws; all elements (identification by step, mechanisms, justifiability discussion, non-protected group implications, fairness/equity impacts) are flawlessly covered with precise quotes and logical flow. Only a perfect 10 requires zero such nits.
