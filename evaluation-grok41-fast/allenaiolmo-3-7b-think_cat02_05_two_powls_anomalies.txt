**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (supporting higher score):**
- **Accurate core anomaly identification**: Correctly pinpoints Model 1's key issue (decision executable after screening without requiring interviews) and Model 2's issues (interviews not ordered after screening, LOOP enabling repeatable onboarding/potential non-termination, XOR enabling payroll skip). Aligns well with normative sequence (Post  Screen  Interview  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close).
- **Severity assessment**: Appropriately labels critical/high severity, distinguishing sequence logic (Model 1) from control-flow (Model 2). Table provides clear comparison.
- **Structure and clarity**: Well-organized with normative summary, per-model breakdowns, and justified conclusion. No verbosity or repetition in final answer.
- **Conclusion defensible**: Choosing Model 1 as closer (sequence deviations less severe than control-flow failures like loops/XOR) is logically sound and process-oriented; normative alignment considers both correctness and integrity.

**Flaws/Inaccuracies/Unclarities (deducting to 7.2; each minor flaw significantly penalizes per instructions):**
- **Model 1 partial order misunderstanding (moderate flaw, -1.0)**: Describes as "bypassing interviews" (correct) but implies a "correct path exists" where Interview  Decide is enforced. Actually, *no edge between Interview and Decide* means the partial order allows *Decide < Interview* (post-decision interviews, absurd anomaly) or parallelism, not just bypass. This violates causality more severely than stated; conclusion's "maintains the correct decision-making dependency (despite the shortcut)" is inaccurate—the dependency is *not maintained/enforced*.
- **Minor overstatement on Model 1 alignment (minor flaw, -0.5)**: "Partially aligned (correct path exists)" overlooks that no strict Screen  Interview  Decide chain exists; all paths risk invalid decision timing.
- **LOOP semantics slightly imprecise (minor flaw, -0.3)**: Correctly flags infinite loop potential, but "Onboard  skip" semantics allow 1+ Onboards (not strictly infinite unless runtime chooses loop forever); still anomalous for one-time onboarding, but hypercritically, doesn't note silent skip enables minimal 1x execution as "valid" variant.
- **Subjectivity in comparison without quantification (minor unclarity, -0.3)**: Claims Model 2 "much worse" and "functionally broken," but doesn't rigorously quantify (e.g., # invalid traces or normative conformance). Defensible but not airtight.
- **No mention of silent transitions' full impact (minor omission, -0.2)**: Skip in LOOP/XOR correctly flagged, but silent nature allows "invisible" skips/loops without trace anomalies, subtly worsening Model 2 undetected.

**Overall**: Nearly strong (8+ potential), but logical imprecision on Model 1's partial order (core to POWL) and dependency claim prevent "nearly flawless." Equivalent to B-/A- academic grading: comprehensive, mostly correct, but flawed reasoning undermines perfection.
