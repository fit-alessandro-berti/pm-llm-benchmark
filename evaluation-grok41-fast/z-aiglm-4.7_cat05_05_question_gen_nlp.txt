The final output is a precise list of exactly 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions (all starting with interrogative structures like "How," "What," "To what extent," or "In what ways"), directly derived from and faithfully referencing elements in the process description (e.g., specific suppliers/countries, 24/7 Malaysia assembly, air/sea freight, JIT/aggregated strategies, regional DCs, ML forecasting, recalls, regulations, currencies, carbon footprint, digital systems). They rigorously focus on insights (e.g., Q18 on feedback loops), issues (e.g., Q2 on vulnerabilities, Q9 on black swans), improvements (e.g., Q12 on near-shoring, Q19 on prioritization), and implications (e.g., Q6 on currencies, Q8 on hidden costs). No SQL queries, no extraneous content, no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws; every question is professionally phrased, relevant, and inferentially sound without fabricating details.
