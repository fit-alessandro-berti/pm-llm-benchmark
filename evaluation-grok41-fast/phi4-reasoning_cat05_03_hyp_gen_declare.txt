**Grade: 7.2**

### Rationale for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies (partial credit, major flaws):** Correctly identifies the core contradiction in `noncoexistence(E, C)` vs. intended flow (both E and C must occur). However, weakly characterizes `responded_existence(E, A)` as "not as contradictory" and vaguely claims it "contributes to a constrained execution path that may force other activities," which is unclear, logically imprecise, and fails to recognize it as a likely *additional major anomaly*. In DECLARE semantics, `responded_existence(E, A)` enforces *A after every E*, directly contradicting the intended flow (A *before* E). This is a significant omission/misanalysis of a contradictory constraint. No mention of broader conflicts (e.g., `existence(C)` + `noncoexistence(E, C)` rendering most ideal traces invalid). Vague phrasing undermines clarity. (~60% accurate/complete)
  
- **Hypotheses (strong):** Four hypotheses are directly relevant, well-phrased, and mirror prompt examples (misinterpretation, incremental changes, technical issues, process pressure). No inaccuracies or fluff. (~95% flawless)

- **SQL Verification Strategies (strong but imperfect):** 
  - Query 1: Flawless—precisely checks closure without evaluation.
  - Query 2: Flawless—directly verifies `noncoexistence` violations.
  - Query 3: Technically correct SQL, useful for business logic (no A *preceding* E), and aligns with prompt example ("evaluation steps always correspond with assigned adjusters"). However, it verifies *precedence(A, E)* (not explicitly in model) rather than the model's `responded_existence(E, A)` (which requires A *after* E); a hypercritical view sees mismatch with the cited rule, reducing precision.
  - Overall: Well-formatted, PostgreSQL-valid, targeted. Minor deduction for Query 3 not perfectly mapping to model's anomalous `responded_existence`. (~90% flawless)

**Overall:** Strong structure, covers all tasks independently, no hints from prompt/context leaked. But anomalies section has critical incompleteness (missed/misstated key contradiction in `responded_existence`) and vagueness, warranting deduction under "utmost strictness." Not "nearly flawless"—logical flaws prevent 9+. Balanced at 7.2.
