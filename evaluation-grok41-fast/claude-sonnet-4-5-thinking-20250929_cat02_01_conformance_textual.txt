**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless: it correctly identifies all compliant (1, 4) and non-compliant (2, 3, 5) cases with zero errors in classification. Explanations are precise, directly reference the normative description's key constraints (e.g., sequencing rules for Authorize/Package/Ship, no fulfillment post-Cancel, branches after Check), interpret ambiguities logically (e.g., Authorize-then-Cancel as inconsistent branching), and highlight all relevant violations without omission or invention (e.g., Case 3's multiple issues including missing Package and post-Cancel Ship; Case 5's skip). Structure is exemplary (summary, per-case details, conclusion), sequences are accurately summarized, and language is clear/concise with no logical flaws, unclarities, or extraneous content. No penalties apply.
