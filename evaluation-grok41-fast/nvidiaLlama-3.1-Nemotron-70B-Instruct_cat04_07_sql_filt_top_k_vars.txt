**9.2**

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation)
This answer is excellent overall—logically sound, well-structured, correctly uses DuckDB features (e.g., `ARRAY_AGG` with `ORDER BY` for sequences, CTEs for modularity, array equality for grouping/joins), and precisely fulfills all 4 requirements:
- Ordered sequences per case:  Perfect.
- Grouping/counting variants:  Perfect.
- Top K by frequency:  Correctly sorts `DESC` by count, `LIMIT`.
- Filtered events:  Joins correctly return *all* original events (`el.*`) from matching cases only, no duplication (1:1 joins per event), excludes others.

**Strengths (supporting high score):**
- Complete, executable query provided.
- Step-by-step breakdown aids clarity.
- Handles core logic flawlessly (e.g., array-based variant ID is efficient/accurate in DuckDB).
- Notes address parameterization, assumptions, performance—thoughtful.
- No factual errors, no missing columns, no incorrect filtering.

**Strict Deductions (minor issues compound to -0.8):**
1. **K parameterization unclarity/inaccuracy (-0.3):** Prompt specifies "top K" generically; step 3 code uses invalid `LIMIT K` (syntax error—K undefined, not a literal/param). Complete query hardcodes `3` ("example"), with note to "replace". This is a template, not a flawless general solution. Hypercritical: executable query is K=3-specific, not truly for arbitrary K (no `?` param, no `SET` var). Minor but violates "unclarities" criterion.
2. **Incomplete tie-handling (-0.2):** Ties in `variant_count` lead to arbitrary top K selection (no `FETCH FIRST K ROWS WITH TIES` or secondary sort). Prompt implies strict top-by-frequency; undefined behavior on ties is a logical gap, even if minor/unlikely.
3. **Potential recompute inefficiency (-0.2):** Final join recomputes `case_sequences` implicitly in scope (full scan/agg on all cases), though CTE optimizes. Not wrong, but note mentions indexing without noting better alt (e.g., extract top case_ids via subquery to `WHERE case_id IN (...)`). Minor perf/logic nitpick under "hypercritical."
4. **Timestamp tie instability (-0.1):** `ORDER BY timestamp` alone unstable on equal timestamps (no secondary key like event ID). Prompt says "sorting by timestamp"—order arbitrary in ties, minor logical flaw.

Nearly flawless (would be 10.0 without these), but strict policy demands significant penalty per issue. No criminal/low-quality issues.
