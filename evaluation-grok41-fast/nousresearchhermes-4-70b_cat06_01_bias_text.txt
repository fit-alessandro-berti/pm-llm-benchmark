**9.0**

The answer is exceptionally strong: it precisely identifies bias sources in Steps 3 and 4 with accurate descriptions of mechanisms (hidden score boost, implicit human judgment), systematically evaluates justifiability with balanced pros/cons, and thoroughly addresses implications for fairness/equity (e.g., hidden inequities, disparate impact risks, redlining parallels). Logical flow is flawless, structure enhances clarity, and recommendations logically extend the analysis without overstepping the question. Minor deduction for one factual inaccuracy ("EOCA" instead of "ECOA") and slight imprecision ("marginalized backgrounds" assumes unstated correlations, though inferable), preventing a perfect score under hypercritical standards.
