**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (supporting score above 5):**
  - **Structure and Completeness (9.5/10):** Perfectly mirrors the prompt's three tasks. Anomalies clearly listed with 4 key ones matching the example (R-P low STDEV, P-N high delay/variance, A-C short implausible, E-N unrealistically fast). Hypotheses are insightful, business-relevant, and tied to each anomaly (e.g., automation, KPIs, backlogs). Queries cover identification of outliers, correlations (adjusters, regions, types, resources, customers), and aggregates. No reference to instructions; standalone presentation.
  - **Anomaly Identification (9.8/10):** Precise (e.g., "unnaturally rigid" for R-P STDEV, "implausibly short" for A-C/E-N). Quantifies times accurately (25h, 7 days, etc.).
  - **Hypotheses (9.5/10):** Plausible, specific (e.g., "auto-closed via rule engine," "queued vs. sent notifications"). Covers systemic, human, and data issues without fluff.
  - **Query Coverage and Intent (8.5/10):** Targets prompt (outliers outside ranges like ±1 STDEV, correlations by adjuster/region/type). Uses PostgreSQL idioms (EXTRACT(EPOCH), CTEs, HAVING). Fifth query excellent for aggregation. Thresholds reasonable (e.g., P-N >10d, A-C <4h~mean+2STDEV, E-N <300s~mean).
  - **Insightfulness (9.0/10):** Queries go beyond basics (e.g., NOT EXISTS for skipped steps, resource joins).

- **Critical Flaws Deducting Points (strict deductions for inaccuracies/logical issues):**
  - **Major SQL Logical Bugs in Queries 1-4 (-1.5 total):** None preserve specific event instances across CTE-to-main joins. CTE computes duration from specific `ce1`/`ce2` pairs (per `claim_id`, `activity`, `timestamp >`), but main query JOINs `ce1`/`ce2` *only* on `claim_id` + `activity`, causing cartesian products/duplicates/wrong timestamps/resources if >1 event per activity per claim (schema allows multiples via `event_id`). E.g., 2 'P' events  2x rows per original pair, mismatched `resource`/`timestamp`. Flawless SQL needs `event_id` in CTE or `LAG/LEAD`/`ROW_NUMBER()`. Query 5 avoids this (aggregates directly).
  - **Query 1 Specific Inaccuracy (-0.6):** NOT EXISTS excludes 'A'/'E' *between specific R-P pair*, but profile is "eventual" time (prompt: "not necessarily directly"). Finds skipped-step outliers (good hypothesis), but not *all* R-P time outliers (misses intermediates). Title claims "R-P timing outside," but filters subset  misleading. Redundant joins inefficient.
  - **Query Threshold/Logic Nitpicks (-0.4):** E-N "<300s" (mean=300s) finds *below*-avg, but anomaly is "too-quick overall" (low mean/STDEV); better <mean-STDEV (~240s). A-C "<4h" generous (mean=2h STDEV=1h  +2STDEV). P-N ">10d" arbitrary (>mean+1.7STDEV ok, but inconsistent with others' ±1STDEV).
  - **Minor Unclarities/Assumptions (-0.3):** Resource=adjuster_id::VARCHAR assumes stringified INTEGER IDs (plausible but unverified; no `claims` join in some for `submission_date`). No handling multiple timestamps per activity (e.g., `MIN/MAX(timestamp)` per activity). No actual STDEV calc query to *validate profile* (prompt implies verify anomalies via outliers/correlations).
  - **Over-Specificity (-0.2):** Queries hardcode thresholds (good) but no parameterization/comments for Z-score (e.g., `WHERE ABS(duration - 90000) > 2*3600`).

- **Overall:** Near-excellent (would be 9.5 if SQL flawless), but SQL bugs are *inaccuracies/logical flaws* making queries unreliable (fail on real data with multiples). Strict policy demands "significantly lower" for these—not minor. 7.2 reflects high quality offset by core technical errors preventing "nearly flawless."
