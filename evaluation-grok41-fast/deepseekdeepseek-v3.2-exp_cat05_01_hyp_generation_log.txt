**8.0**

### Strengths (Supporting High Score)
- **Anomaly Identification**: Comprehensively spots key deviations (out-of-sequence in 1002/1003/1004, missing "Validate Stock" in 1003, early payment in 1004, late "Confirm Shipment" in 1003). Matches data precisely without fabrication. Minor miss: 1004's "shipment_scheduled=N" followed by "Ship Goods" (policy violation risk) not explicitly called out.
- **Hypotheses**: Directly aligns with prompt (system errors, policy violations/bypasses, training gaps, data entry issues). Plausible, varied, and tied to anomalies (e.g., priority overrides, workarounds).
- **SQL Relevance**: Queries target hypotheses (sequences, missings, timings, depts, resources). Uses all tables appropriately. Query 2 (missings) flawless for 1003. Query 4 catches 1002 dept jumps. Query 5 precisely probes "Ship without Validate."
- **Structure/Clarity**: Logical organization, executable PostgreSQL syntax, insightful commentary.

### Weaknesses (Deductions for Strictness)
- **Major Logical Flaw in Query 1 (Sequence Violations, -1.5)**: Fails to detect core 1002/1003 issues. E.g., 1002 "Perform Credit Check" (prev: "Ship Goods") unmatched by WHERE; "Validate Stock" (prev: "Credit Check") unmatched. 1003 "Ship Goods" (prev: "Credit Check") and "Confirm Shipment" (prev: "Issue Invoice") unmatched. Only catches contrived/direct pairs or broad post-payment noise. Third WHERE clause sloppy/overbroad (flags any post-payment activity  "Register Order").
- **Query 3 Issues (-0.3)**: "activities_before_payment" mislabeled/total count (not pre-payment). HAVING null-safe? (e.g., no "Issue Invoice": `timestamp < NULL` falsy). Redundant EXTRACT. Still detects 1004 but imprecise.
- **Query 5 Minor (-0.1)**: AVG rates misleading (event-level, not case-level); correlated subquery inefficient (scales poorly).
- **Coverage Gaps (-0.1)**: No query for "late confirmations" hypothesis or "shipment_scheduled=N" risks. No order_type/resource-role patterns (e.g., priority in 1002).
- **Nitpicks (-0.0)**: No edge-case handling (e.g., duplicate activities); assumes all mandatories (but flow has 7).

Nearly excellent (covers prompt fully), but Query 1's failure on primary anomaly prevents 9+. Flawless would fix all logic, add missed query, perfect labels.
