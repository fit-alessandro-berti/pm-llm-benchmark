**10.0**

The final query is correct, complete, and precisely meets all requirements without inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities:

- Correctly uses `LEAD` over `(PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)` to detect exact consecutive sequences starting from 'Approve Purchase Requisition' rows.
- Accurately computes time difference `(next_next_ts - next_ts) > INTERVAL '5 days'` specifically between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' timestamps in matching triplets.
- Identifies cases with *at least one* such bad triplet via `DISTINCT case_id` in `CasesToExclude`.
- Excludes *all events* from those cases using `NOT IN`, returning all other events as `SELECT * FROM event_log`.
- Handles edge cases (NULLs from `LEAD` auto-filtered by activity string matches; multiple triplets per case; exact 5-day diffs excluded).
- Valid DuckDB syntax (interval comparison works; casing inconsistencies are ignored as SQL keywords are case-insensitive).

No penalties needed; it is flawless.
