**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong overall—comprehensive, well-structured, and precisely aligned with the prompt's goals of targeting missing details (e.g., Q5 on data verification), decision criteria (e.g., Q8 on factor weighting), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q29), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q26-28), and exceptions (e.g., Q23-25). All 36 questions are conceptually focused, avoid SQL/implementation, and are predominantly open-ended ("How...", "What...", "Can you describe..."). Categorization enhances usability, and the wrap-up sentence reinforces intent without detracting.

**Minor flaws deducting from perfection (strict deductions totaling -0.8):**
- **Slightly closed/leading phrasing in 3 questions (Q4, Q9, Q18)**: Q4 ("Are there service-level targets... and how...?") starts with a yes/no binary, potentially eliciting a short "no" before details; Q9/Q18 use conditional "if" structures assuming scenarios ("If no manager...", "does the landlord have final say"), which could narrow responses vs. purer opens like "What happens when...?". Hypercritical view: These violate "open-ended" ideal by ~10% (3/36 questions), warranting -0.3.
- **Extrapolations beyond described process (Q32-36)**: Process ends at move-in/audits, but these probe KPIs, reviews, regulations, and *post*-move-in retrospectives/feedback. While deepening understanding, they introduce undescribed elements (e.g., "tenant satisfaction" metrics not mentioned), risking scope creep. Prompt specifies "their process" from the description; this adds ~10% unsubstantiated expansion, -0.3.
- **Excessive length (36 questions)**: "A series" implies concise probing (e.g., 10-20), not exhaustive audit. Overkill risks interviewee fatigue, diluting focus; minor bloat (e.g., Q6 on standardization feels tangential), -0.2.

No inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities—every question ties back logically, no repetition, perfect coverage of core areas. Flawless would be 20-25 tighter questions with zero assumptive phrasing and zero extras. Still, elite quality justifies high score.
