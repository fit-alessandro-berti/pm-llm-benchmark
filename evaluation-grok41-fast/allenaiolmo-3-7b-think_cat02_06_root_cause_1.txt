**4.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Strict Evaluation):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the three long cases (102, 104, 105) vs. short ones (101, 103), fulfilling task 1 at a high level. Recognizes key patterns like escalations (in 102/105), post-investigation gaps, and proposes logical root causes (handoffs, stale tickets, workload) and practical recommendations (SLAs, alerts, automation), covering task 2-3 well. Structure is clear, comprehensive, and professional.
- **Critical Flaws (heavy penalties)**:
  - **Inaccurate durations/gaps (core to analysis)**: Case 105 total is listed as 25h5m (wrong; actual ~49h5m from 03-01 08:25 to 03-03 09:30 = 48h base +1h5m). Gaps misstated across cases (e.g., 102: 12h vs. actual 19h; 104: 13h vs. 19h; 105: "5h between investigations" vs. ~29h, "12h after second" vs. 19h). These are not minor—timestamps are the dataset; errors distort severity/ordering (e.g., implies 102 longest).
  - **Wrong average**: ~15.6h (based on flawed 105); actual ~20.4h. "~1.5–1.6x longer" incorrect (actual ratios ~1.2x/1.2x/2.4x).
  - **Logical issues**: Attributes 104 delay partly to "no escalation" (stuck at L1), but ignores its similar post-investigation gap pattern as escalated cases—undermines consistent "gap" cause. Misses obvious pattern: all long cases have massive overnight stalls (business-hours support?), short cases resolve same-day.
  - **Unclarities**: Vague on "significantly longer" (relies on flawed metrics; no clear threshold like median/2x short-case avg ~2h).
- **Overall**: Factually flawed evidence undermines conclusions despite good framing. Not "nearly flawless"—major data errors in a time-based analysis warrant sharp deduction under hypercritical criteria.
