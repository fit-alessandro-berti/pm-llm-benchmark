**5.0**

### Explanation of Grade
The answer is structured logically with clear sections matching the task (normative violations, desiderata, interpretations), uses precise timestamp references, correctly identifies violations in Case 1 (none), Case 2's order inversion and post-rejection finalization, and Case 3 (none normative), and handles desiderata appropriately with clarifications of suboptimality. Justifications are plausible and non-contradictory. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Critical inaccuracy (major deduction)**: In Case 2 normative violations, it completely misses the skipping of "Inform Applicant" entirely—no such activity exists between Loan Decision (09:30) and Finalize Documentation (10:00), violating the strict sequence ("Loan Decision  Inform Applicant") and the explicit rule against skipping steps ("At no point should the process skip steps"). This is a core normative breach equivalent in severity to the identified ones, rendering the analysis incomplete and logically flawed for Case 2.
- **Minor unclarities/logical ripples**: Case 2 desiderata section vaguely references "normative order issues already overshadow[ing]" without noting the absent Inform impacts timing assessment (e.g., no promptness evaluable). Summary reiterates the incompleteness without correction.
- **No other flaws**: Desiderata handling (e.g., Case 3 timings accurately calculated as >24h/48h, Follow-up Call as optional) and interpretations are solid.

This is ~70% correct but not "nearly flawless" due to the omission of a blatant, task-central violation—warranting a mid-range score despite strong overall execution.
