The provided answer is flawless: the SQL query is logically correct, efficient, and precisely matches the requirements by using a CTE to compute per-case event counts, then INNER JOINing back to filter (via `<= 6`) and return all events (`el.*`) only for qualifying cases. It handles grouping accurately, avoids including excluded cases entirely, and works in DuckDB (standard SQL). The explanation is concise, accurate, and directly tied to the query steps with no extraneous details, ambiguities, or errors. No inaccuracies, inefficiencies, or edge cases overlooked (e.g., preserves all columns/rows for valid cases; INNER JOIN is safe as all `case_id`s exist in both).
