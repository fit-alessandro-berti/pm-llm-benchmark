**6.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score):** Excellent structure mirroring the task (normative ID, desiderata ID with required clarification on non-severity/suboptimality, interpretations/justifications). Correctly identifies Case 1 as fully compliant. Accurately details the two annotated normative violations in Case 2 (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection) with precise explanations tied to rules. Correctly identifies all three desiderata issues in Case 3 with accurate timing calculations and quotes prompt language. Interpretations are reasonable and "in line" with constraints. Clear summaries.
- **Major Inaccuracies/Flaws (significant deductions):** 
  - **Incomplete normative violation identification in Case 2:** Entirely misses the mandatory "Inform Applicant" step, which is explicitly required "following the loan decision" (regardless of approve/reject) per both textual description and sequence diagram. Case 2 log skips it entirely (Decision at 09:30  Finalize at 10:00  Close at 10:30, no Inform row), violating "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision" and the overall sequence (cannot branch to Close without it). This is a core normative constraint, not desiderata, and as obvious as the other two violations. Failing to list/explain this halves the completeness of Task 1.
  - **Unasked-for content:** Adds "Suggestions for Improvement" section (training, system checks, etc.), bloating the response beyond the three tasked elements. While helpful, hypercritical strictness views extraneous material as deviation from instructions.
  - **Minor unclarities/logical gaps:** Case 1 claimed to adhere to "all desiderata/best practices," but prompt encourages "Follow-up Call... before closing the case" for *all* cases; log shows none for Case 1 (unlike Case 3's explicit note), risking subtle inaccuracy. Interpretations for Case 2 do not address the missed Inform, making them incomplete. Phrasing like "sequence violation" (singular) understates multiple issues.
- **Overall:** 60% flawless (good coverage of ~70% of violations/content), but major incompleteness on key normative analysis prevents >7.0. Not "nearly flawless"—significant logical flaw in analysis lowers substantially per criteria.
