**6.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting partial credit):**
  - **Anomaly Identification (9/10):** Precisely spots all key deviations (out-of-sequence in 1002/1003/1004, missing steps in 1003/1004) matching the data. No misses or inventions.
  - **Hypotheses (8/10):** Logical and relevant (system enforcement gaps, priority bypasses, human error, policy exceptions). Ties to data (e.g., priority in 1002, upfront payment in 1004). Minor overreach on "warehouse staff without manager" in 1002 (where LogisticsMgr_2 confirmed *before* shipping).
  - **Root Causes (8/10):** Concise, actionable (system limits, training, controls). Aligns with hypotheses.
  - **Overall Structure/Clarity (9/10):** Well-organized, uses tables/CTEs appropriately, proposes queries targeting hypotheses (sequence, missing steps, resources, order types).

- **Weaknesses (major deductions for strict criteria):**
  - **SQL Queries (4/10):** Critical inaccuracies and logical flaws undermine utility:
    | Query | Issue | Impact |
    |-------|--------|--------|
    | 1 (Sequence) | LAG checks *only adjacent* activities. Misses non-adjacent out-of-order (e.g., case 1003: Ship Goods prev=Credit Check, Confirm prev=Issue Invoice  returns nothing). Doesn't cover listed anomalies (1002 credit-after-ship, 1004 payment-before-invoice). | Fails core purpose; irrelevant output. |
    | 2 (Missing Steps) | `bool_and(e.activity = '...')` is fundamentally broken. With LEFT JOIN + GROUP BY, evaluates *across all activities per case*  always false (mixed activities  single activity). Returns *all cases*, useless for detection. Ignores NULLs improperly. | Completely non-functional; opposite of "relevant to investigate." |
    | 3 (Time) | Correct (catches 1004 precisely). | N/A |
    | 4 (Resources) | Logical (catches unconfirmed ships, e.g., 1003). Minor: Hypothesis ties loosely to 1002 (where confirmed prior). | Good but narrow. |
    | 5 (Priority) | Hacky `STRING_AGG` + `LIKE` works for data but brittle/unreliable (space/-> mismatches fail generally; `NOT LIKE '%Validate Stock%'` catches missing but flags incomplete sequences vaguely). Counts unreliable without full anomaly def. | Functional but unprofessional/low-robustness. |
    - Overall: ~50% flawed/broken  fails "propose relevant SQL ... to investigate further." No broad sequence check (e.g., ROW_NUMBER vs expected order) or resource dept joins despite schema.
  - **Completeness (7/10):** Covers main anomalies but ignores others (e.g., 1002 early Confirm Shipment/Validate Stock skip; 1004 no credit/stock; unrealistic timings like 5-min payment). No queries for resource-role segregation or dept mismatches (resources table underused).
  - **Precision/Unclarity (6/10):** Minor: Query 1 condition unclear (adjacent-only implied?); resource hypo stretches data.

- **Net Score:** Solid analysis (8 avg) dragged by flawed SQLs (-2.0 for bugs, as "even minor issues"  "significantly lower"; these are major). Not "nearly flawless" (requires 9.5+). Equivalent to B-/C+ in strict academic grading.
