**10.0**

The final answer provides a valid, well-formed Python dictionary exactly matching the required format: keys are correctly ordered tuples of activity labels from the process (all respecting the logical sequence SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS), values are tuples of plausible (average_time, standard_deviation) in seconds (consistent with the example's units and scale, e.g., hours for short intervals, days for long ones).

- **Representative subset with complexity**: 10 pairs, mixing adjacent/short-range (e.g., ('SS', 'OP')) and multi-step separations (e.g., ('SS', 'DT') with 7 activities between; ('OP', 'WS')/'RC'-'DT'/'QI'-'DT' with 5/5/4 between; ('CA', 'AS') with 4 between). Covers early/mid/late process spans, all activities represented, no redundancies or invalid orders.
- **Estimates**: Logically derived from supply chain realities (short/low-variance for procurement/inspection; longer/higher-variance for manufacturing/distribution/post-sale due to cumulative factors). Stdevs reasonable (e.g., ~20-40% of mean, increasing with distance), positive, non-zero.
- **Code**: Syntactically perfect, directly executable. Comments enhance clarity without detracting (optional but informative).

No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or deviations from specs—nearly/fully flawless under strict scrutiny.
