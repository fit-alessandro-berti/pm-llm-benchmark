**8.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
**Strengths (supporting high base score):**
- **Structure and Documentation (flawless):** Exceptional use of tables for matching steps, normalization, timestamp diffs, merged log, per-row explanations, and summary. Fully addresses "document your reasoning for how events were matched... conflicts resolved." Transparent, reproducible process. Unified names logical and consistently applied. Chronological ordering perfect using defined canonical TS (A-primary).
- **Attribute Integration (flawless):** Correctly enriches merged events with all B attributes (user_id, resource_id, notes); blanks for Aonly. Source flags (A+B, Aonly, Bonly) clear.
- **Handling Uniques/Non-Matches (flawless):** Quality Check and Item Delivered correctly isolated. Payment pair correctly *not* merged (5s > tolerance).
- **Primary Timeline Respect (flawless):** Canonical TS always A's for merges; B's for Bonly.
- **Overall Output Quality:** Produces a clean, usable table. Handles naming variations intelligently (e.g., Payment Processed  PaymentCheck).

**Flaws/Deductions (strict, cumulative; total -1.8):**
1. **Tolerance Misapplication (major logical flaw, -0.8):** Prompt specifies "less than 2 seconds" (*strictly <2s*). Answer uses 2s ("differ **2seconds**", merges exact 2s diffs: order_received 10:00:00A–09:59:58B=2s; item_shipped 10:05:00A–10:05:02B=2s). Results in **two incorrect merges** (#1, #6). Even if "tolerance" implies 2s, explicit "less than" + example phrasing demands <2s. Changes output validity—those should be Aonly/Bonly pairs like payment.
2. **Timestamp Format Inaccuracy (medium, -0.4):** Claims "ISO8601, UTC" but uses non-standard compact `20231010T10:00:00Z` (mixes basic date + extended time; proper ISO extended is `2023-10-10T10:00:00Z`, basic `20231010T100000Z`). Original logs use full extended ISO—copy error reduces precision/professionalism.
3. **Missing Explicit Dual Timestamps (minor, -0.2):** Prompt allows "select one as primary *or include both*." Selects A (correct) but doesn't include B's TS anywhere in merged table (despite claiming "Btimestamp is also retained for reference"/"implicitly kept"). Source "A+B" insufficient—readers can't see offset without back-referencing tables.
4. **Notes Alteration (minor, -0.2):** Row 2 notes "Crosscheck inventory" vs original "Cross-check inventory" (hyphen dropped). Trivial but unnecessary change; hypercritical fidelity demands exact copy.
5. **Explanation Overclaim (minor, -0.2):** Row 1/overall: "Btimestamp... stored in the 'source' field"—false; source is just "A+B", no TS stored. Misleads.

**Why not lower/higher?** Base 10  deduct only for identified issues. Not 10.0 (not "nearly flawless"—core matching logic wrong). Not <8 (flaws don't cascade to invalidate whole output; 80%+ matches correct, structure exemplary). 8.2 reflects "very good but critically flawed execution."
