**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (basis for high score)**: The response is exceptionally well-structured, comprehensive, and directly aligned with the prompt. All 31 questions are open-ended, targeted at key prompt goals (missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, exceptions). Excellent coverage of the described process stages without gaps or irrelevance. No SQL, code, or overt implementation (e.g., no "how to build" or tech specs). Logical flow via categories mirrors the process description. Questions are precise, professional, and deepen *conceptual* understanding (e.g., criteria, handoffs, exceptions). Intro/outro text enhances without fluff.
  
- **Minor Flaws (deductions totaling -0.8)**:
  - **Excessive quantity (31 questions)**: A "series" implies concise (10-20 ideal); this risks interviewee fatigue, diluting focus. Minor overload flaw (-0.3).
  - **Borderline implementation probes**: Q5 ("system or tool"), Q18 ("tools or systems"), Q1 ("standardized intake form") skirt "implementation details" by naming artifacts/tools. Conceptual enough to not tank, but strictly per prompt, they invite specifics beyond pure process (-0.3).
  - **Slight leading/closed elements**: Q1 ("Is there...?"), Q15 ("What criteria determine...?") have faint yes/no tinge, though mostly open. Hyper-minor phrasing nit (-0.1).
  - **Extraneous expansion**: Q28 (pain points/bottlenecks), Q31 (success metrics from landlord view) probe undescribed "realities" valuably but stretch beyond "clarify[ing] *their process*" to meta-analysis (-0.1).

Nearly flawless—award adjusted for strictness; flawless would be 15-20 laser-focused questions with zero edge cases.
