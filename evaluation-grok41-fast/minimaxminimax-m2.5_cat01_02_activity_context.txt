**9.5**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (near-perfect execution)**:
  - **Task 1 (Identification & Interpretation)**: Flawlessly identifies all relevant recurring activities (Verify Documents in C001/C003; Call Customer in C002, with contextual extension to singles). Table precisely maps occurrences, positions, and contexts (e.g., initial vs. post-change for verification; purpose-specific for calls). No misses; interpretations directly from timestamps, sequences, and Additional Context.
  - **Task 2 (Renaming)**: Renames are contextually precise, disambiguating via position (first/second) and purpose (e.g., "Request Missing Info" from "request missing docs"; "Recall Customer" from "calls to have them return"). Handles singletons consistently for full disambiguation without over-renaming uniques.
  - **Task 3 (Revised Log)**: Complete, accurate reproduction of original log structure/content (timestamps, resources exact). Markdown table readable and professional (proper spanning for cases). New names correctly slotted per case/context. Highlights process roles effectively.
  - **Task 4 (Justification)**: Brief, tabular, and clue-tied (e.g., "after a change – either after... supplied missing documentation or... adjustment"). Directly references Additional Context/position without verbosity.
  - Structure: Clear sections matching tasks; proactive/comprehensive without extras.

- **Minor Inaccuracies/Unclarities (deductions totaling -0.5)**:
  - **Additional Context alterations** (4 instances, cosmetic but literal inaccuracies despite "(unchanged)" header):
    | Location | Original | Answer | Issue |
    |----------|----------|--------|-------|
    | C003 Initiate Request | "Walk-in customer at branch." | "Walkin customer at branch." | Removed hyphen/space ("Walkin" incorrect). |
    | C001 Verify (Reverification) | "Agent re-checks documents..." | "Agent rechecks documents..." | Removed hyphen. |
    | C002 Call (Confirm Adjustment) | "Follow-up call..." | "Followup call..." | Removed hyphen. |
    | C003 Verify (Reverification) | "Re-verify docs..." | "Reverify docs..." | Removed hyphen (one word). |
    These are trivial (no semantic change) but violate "unchanged" and exact log fidelity—hypercritical penalty: -0.125 each.
  - No logical flaws, ambiguities, or omissions; no overgeneralization (e.g., doesn't force reverification in C002).

Nearly flawless (analysis/names/log/justification exemplary); deductions only for precise reproduction slips. Lower would be unjust for non-impactful typos.
