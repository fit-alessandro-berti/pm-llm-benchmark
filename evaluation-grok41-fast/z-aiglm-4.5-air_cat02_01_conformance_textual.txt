**7.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting ~7-8 range)**: Correctly identifies **exact violating cases** (2, 3, 5) and non-violating (1, 4)—flawless on task #1. Excellent structure with sequences listed, clear per-case breakdowns, references to description, ambiguity resolutions where relevant (e.g., Case 2 logical flow), and concise conclusion. Key violations well-explained where accurate (e.g., Case 2 order inversion, Case 3 Ship after Cancel, Case 5 missing Package).
- **Inaccuracies/Unclarities (major deductions)**:
  1. **Key Rules #1 factual error**: Claims Cases 2/3/5 "violate [Check inventory precedence] indirectly by misplacing subsequent activities." **False**—Check inventory correctly precedes all other activities in 2/3/5 (immediately after Receive). This misapplies a non-issue as a violation, undermining summary credibility (-1.0).
  2. **Case 3 invention of violation**: Labels skipping "Package items" a "**minor secondary violation**" with "implicit rule" rationale. **Wrong**—description mandates skipping fulfillment (packaging/shipping) in cancel path ("directly proceed to Cancel... Close"; "illogical to continue with... packaging"). This fabricates a violation where conformance exists (-1.0).
  3. **Case 3 omission of clear violation**: Fails to flag "Authorize payment" before "Cancel order" as deviation. Description requires **direct** Check  Cancel for insufficient inventory; inserting Authorize violates branching ("must branch into cancellation scenario... directly proceed") and logic ("payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known"—Cancel implies insufficiency). Partial coverage (only Ship flagged) is incomplete (-0.5).
- **Logical Flaws/Minor Issues (further deductions)**:
  - Redundant violations in Case 2 (#1/#2 same issue: Package before Authorize)—unclear phrasing (-0.3).
  - Key Rules #2 inaccurately groups Case 5 with Case 2 for "payment timing" violation; Case 5 times payment correctly (after Check, before Ship), issue is separate (missing Package) (-0.2).
- **Overall**: ~80% accurate/flawless (strong identification/explanations), but 3+ significant issues (errors, omissions, inventions) prevent "nearly flawless" (9-10). Strict deduction yields 7.0; minor polish could hit 8+.
