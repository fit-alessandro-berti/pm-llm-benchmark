**4.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: 
  - Correct Python dictionary format: keys as tuples of activity pairs (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`), values as `(avg_time_seconds, std_seconds)` tuples. Syntactically valid and executable.
  - Includes all 9 direct sequential pairs from the implied linear process (SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS), fulfilling "pairs that eventually follow each other."
  - Adds 2 indirect pairs (SSCA skipping 3 steps; OPPT skipping 3 steps), providing "complexity by considering pairs... separated by multiple steps" and a "representative subset" (11/45 possible pairs reasonable for subset).
  - Indirect times are logically larger than direct sums (e.g., SSCA at 259200s > sum of intermediates ~54000s), consistent with cumulative delays/variability.
  - Std devs are plausible relative to avgs (e.g., 25-50% of avg, reasonable for process variability).
  - Final explanatory paragraph aligns with task (estimates for direct/indirect, based on "typical durations").

- **Major Inaccuracies & Logical Flaws (severe deductions)**:
  - **Incorrect comments throughout**: 7/11 comments misstate the actual values in seconds (e.g., OPRC: 28800s = 8 hours labeled "3 days" [should be ~259200s]; SSCA: 259200s = 3 days labeled "3 weeks" [~1.8M s]; DTAS: 86400s = 1 day labeled "10 days"; WSDT std 25920s 7h labeled "1 day"). This introduces factual errors directly in the code, undermining credibility and showing computational sloppiness. Comments for PTPK and SSOP are correct, but prevalence of errors is disqualifying.
  - **Unrealistic estimates for "global supply chain" context**: Times vastly underestimate global high-tech electronics procurement/manufacturing (e.g., OPRC lead time 8 hours vs. realistic weeks/months for international suppliers; CAPT 6 hours vs. days for complex assembly/testing; entire SSCA 3 days vs. weeks). Prompt emphasizes "global" with factors like "supplier lead times, manufacturing complexity," yet values resemble domestic same-day logistics. Violates "estimated... typical durations" expectation.
  - **Minor inconsistencies**: WSDT std comment wrong even if avg correct; DTAS conceptually shaky (after-sales typically post-delivery/use, not 1 day from shipping start); no pairs like SSAS or mid-chain skips for fuller representation, though subset excused.

- **Overall**: Structure flawless (worthy of ~8/10 alone), but rampant comment errors + contextually implausible times = critical failures. Not "nearly flawless"—feels careless/hurried. 4.0 reflects ~40% credit for format/content skeleton, heavy penalty for execution flaws.
