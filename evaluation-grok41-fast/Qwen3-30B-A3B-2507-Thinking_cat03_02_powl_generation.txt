The provided answer's final code and explanation are flawless. It precisely constructs the POWL model matching the scenario: correct atomic transitions with exact labels (including "D&R"), proper OperatorPOWL for LOOP ([BNC, DR]) and XOR ([CD, MD]), root StrictPartialOrder with exactly the top-level nodes, and all required order edges (SRCS{DA,ACI}loopxor{QA,SA}GLA) enforcing prerequisites, concurrency (no DAACI or QASA edges), loop semantics, and exclusive choice. No extras, misses, or logical errors; imports match; children properly encapsulated. Explanation accurately summarizes without discrepancies.
