The provided SQL query and explanation are flawless. It precisely identifies cases with the required direct-succession sequence using `LEAD` window functions (ensuring no intervening events via consecutive offsets), correctly computes the interval between the specific 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' timestamps in that sequence (`next_timestamp_2 - next_timestamp_1 > INTERVAL '5 days'`), excludes only those matching cases entirely via `NOT IN`, and returns all events from remaining cases with appropriate ordering. Handles edge cases implicitly (e.g., incomplete sequences yield NULLs that fail the `WHERE`, multiple sequences per case correctly exclude if any qualify). DuckDB syntax is exact. Explanation is concise, accurate, and mirrors the logic. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, logical flaws, inefficiencies, or deviations from requirements.
