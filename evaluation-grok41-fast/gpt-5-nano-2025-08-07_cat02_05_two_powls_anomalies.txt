**8.2**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**:
  - **Comprehensive structure and coverage**: Fully addresses all 3 tasks (analysis vs. normative, anomaly identification with severity, decision on closer model with justification). Uses clear sections, bullet points, and summary. Includes high-level improvements, adding value without straying.
  - **Correct analysis of Model 1**: Accurately describes edges and semantics (e.g., no Interview  Decide, allowing Decide before/parallel to Interview). Correctly flags core anomaly (decision without interview input) as high-severity, violating hiring logic. Notes missing rejection paths (valid, as normative is linear but real processes need branches). Preserves phase ordering reasonably well-described.
  - **Correct identification of Model 2's structural anomalies**: LOOP (multiple onboarding iterations: illogical for one-time hire) and XOR (skippable Payroll: violates HR/financial integrity post-hire) are spot-on, severe, and well-explained. Notes loose Post  Interview (dilutes screening role) accurately.
  - **Reasonable conclusion and justification**: Model 1 closer due to preserved linear progression vs. Model 2's "deeper integrity problems." Logical tradeoff (fixable link in Model 1 vs. pathological loop/XOR in Model 2). Aligns with normative sequential flow.
  - **Depth and logic**: Relates to real-world process logic (e.g., decision needs all inputs, payroll mandatory post-onboard). No unclarities; precise language.

- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Major factual inaccuracy in Model 2 (primary deduction: -1.5)**: Claims "there are edges Screen  Decide and Interview  Decide" and "Decide after either Screen or Interview." **False**—code has **no** Screen  Decide (Screen is dangling post-Post; incomparable to Decide). Listed edges correctly earlier ("Post  Screen; Post  Interview; Interview  Decide"), then contradicts self. This fabricates a "premature decision via Screen" anomaly, inflating Model 2's deviation unfairly. Real semantics: Decide requires only Interview (post-Post), Screen parallel/possible *after* Decide (worse: screening post-decision). Flaw distorts comparison (both models allow incomplete info for Decide, but answer misattributes Model 2's issue).
  - **Minor inaccuracy in Model 1 summary (-0.3)**: Claims it "preserves... screening *and* interviewing precede the hiring decision." Interview does *not* precede Decide (incomparable post-Screen); can follow. Screening does (Screen  Decide). Sloppy overstatement.
  - **Logical overreach in severity (-0.0, borderline)**: Model 2's "parallel screen/interview" called "not inherently wrong" but then flags dilution—consistent, but real issue is Screen *post-Decide* possibility (unmentioned). Doesn't change conclusion but misses nuance.
  - **No other issues**: No unclarities, no criminal/off-policy content, flawless on normative reference integration.

- **Overall calibration**: Near-flawless (structure/depth justify 9+ base), but factual error is non-minor (core graph misread affects anomaly analysis/choice justification). Strict deduction yields 8.2—not 10 (not flawless), not <8 (error doesn't invalidate whole; conclusion survives as Model 2's loop/XOR still worse).
