**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**:
  - **Completeness & Coverage**: Fully addresses all instructions—identifies high-level steps (4 coherent groups reducing 12 events effectively), justifies each grouping with multi-faceted rationale (functional, temporal, resource, station-based, domain-specific like "lean manufacturing" and "quality gates"), assigns domain-relevant names (e.g., "Assembly & Validation"), and provides structured output (tables, mappings, even extras like aggregated log and benefits).
  - **Logical Groupings**: Excellent abstraction; respects sequence, temporal proximity (e.g., no non-contiguous merges), logical flow (prep  transform  finish  inspect), and manufacturing context (inline QC in assembly cycle is nuanced and justified). Balances detail (5421 events) without over-fragmenting.
  - **Clarity & Structure**: Markdown tables pristine, easy to scan; rationale per group explicit; aggregated log innovatively demonstrates applicability to both cases with computed durations/resources. Enhances goal ("workflow at a glance").
  - **Insight**: Goes beyond (benefits, bottleneck ID) without fluff; handles resource handoffs/quality gates insightfully.

- **Flaws & Penalties (Strict Deductions)**:
  - **Inaccuracy in Data Handling (Major Penalty: -1.5)**: Aggregated table has factual error for A1 Surface Finishing—End Timestamp listed as "08:01:50" (B2's time) instead of log's "08:01:45"; duration "20" sec instead of correct 15 sec (08:01:30 to 08:01:45). This is sloppy transcription in a timestamp-critical task; undermines credibility of "precise" abstraction demo, even if isolated to 1/8 rows.
  - **Minor Logical Strain (Penalty: -0.2)**: Grouping "Measure weld integrity" (Sensor resource) fully into "Assembly & Validation" (Operator B dominant) is *defensible* via rationale, but hypercritically, resource shift + distinct "Quality Sensor" could warrant separation as "Inline QC" for purer station logic—slight overreach in merging dissimilar agents.
  - **Thin Final Step (Minor Penalty: -0.1)**: "Final Quality Inspection" as single event is valid ("exit gate"), but uneven vs. others (e.g., 4-event Assembly); could clarify if intentional minimalism.
  - **No Other Issues**: No unclarities, no violations of temporal/logical flow, no omissions, names precise, both cases handled.

Nearly flawless (structure/rationale elite), but data inaccuracy + tiny strains prevent 9+; strictness demands "significantly lower" for *any* issues. Equivalent to A- work.
