The final boxed answer precisely identifies Cases 2, 3, and 5 as violating (correct), with Cases 1 and 4 compliant (correct). Explanations directly reference key normative constraints (e.g., order of Authorize/Package/Ship, no Ship after Cancel or without Package, logical inappropriateness of Authorize before Cancel in cancellation path). No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical flaws; minor phrasing variations (e.g., sequence starting points) do not detract from clarity or correctness.
