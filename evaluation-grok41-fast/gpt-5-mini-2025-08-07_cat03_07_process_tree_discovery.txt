**3.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation:
- **Major logical flaw in loop semantics and trace replay (fitness failure, -4.0 penalty)**: The loop `* (tau, ->('RMI', 'VF', 'AE'))` forces an `AE` after every `RMI -> VF` iteration (traces like `RMI VF AE` or multiples), but the log never repeats `AE`—it always skips re-assessment after re-validation (e.g., Case 1: `AE -> RMI -> VF -> AD`; Case 3: `AE -> RMI -> RMI -> VF -> AD`). No trace replays correctly for deviating cases; happy path (Case 2) works only coincidentally via early `tau` exit. Fails to "capture repetitions of requesting missing info and re-validation" accurately—re-validation (`VF`) occurs without re-`AE`.
- **Fails to model multiple consecutive `RMI` (precision and fitness failure, -1.5 penalty)**: Case 3 has `RMI RMI VF`, but model permits only single `RMI` per iteration (followed by `VF AE`). No support for consecutive `RMI` without intervening `VF/AE`.
- **Syntax inaccuracy (minor but strict deduction, -0.5 penalty)**: `tau` lacks quotes (`'tau'`), inconsistent with notation (`'A'`, `'B'`). Prompt examples use quoted leaves; unquoted `tau` is invalid for `ProcessTree(label=...)`.
- **Structural mismatch to log (simplicity overkill but wrong, -0.5 penalty)**: Loop after initial `AE` is positionally correct, main sequence `RA -> VF -> AE -> ... -> AC` fits, but bloated loop body undermines simplicity and balance.
- **No balance of fitness/precision/simplicity**: Fitness ~50% (happy path only); low precision (over-generalizes absent `AE` repeats); simplicity ok but irrelevant due to errors.

Nearly flawless requires perfect log replay, correct optional/multi-loop for `RMI*? -> VF?`, no extras. This is a plausible but fundamentally broken attempt.
