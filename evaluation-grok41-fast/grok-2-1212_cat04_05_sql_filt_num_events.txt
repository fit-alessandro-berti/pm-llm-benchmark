The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. The SQL query precisely meets the requirements: it uses a CTE to count events per `case_id`, correctly filters with `WHERE ec.event_count <= 6` (accurately excluding >6 while keeping 6), and returns all events (`el.*`) from qualifying cases via a standard inner join. This handles grouping and filtering exactly as specified, works in DuckDB, and is efficient/logical.

Minor nitpicks (none warranting deduction due to zero impact on correctness, clarity, or requirements):
- Unrequested `ORDER BY` is a logical addition (leveraging `timestamp`) but not mandated; it enhances usability without altering the result set.
- CTE comment calls it a "subquery" (technically a CTE, but semantically accurate and trivial).
- Minor repetition in pre/post-query explanations, but they are clear, structured, and reinforce understanding without ambiguity.

No inaccuracies, logical flaws, unclarities, or deviations—pure excellence.
