**4.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (partial credit):** Introduces plausible new activities (e.g., `ManualReview`, `BiasMitigationCheck`, `CheckApplicantRace`) aligned with prompt suggestions. Correctly uses formats for unary/binary constraints. `Succession` additions logically enforce immediate bias checks after sensitive events (tight coupling prevents skipping). Existence forces safeguards (strong anti-bias). Detailed rationale with per-constraint explanations and overall impact.
- **Major Technical Flaw (-3.0):** Duplicate keys in `"coexistence"` dict (`"CheckApplicantRace"` appears twice; same for `CheckApplicantGender`). Python dicts overwrite duplicates silently, so `ManualReview` coexistences are **lost entirely**. Resulting model  stated intent/rationale (e.g., rationale claims both coexistences, but code only retains `BiasMitigationCheck`). Invalid as "valid Python code" per instructions.
- **Major Logical Flaw in Bias Mitigation (-2.0):** `"nonsuccession"` misused. DECLARE `not_succession(A,B)` negates *perfect* succession (requires 1 violation per trace: some A not directly  B *or* some B not  A). Does **not** "block direct transitions" or "prohibit biased paths" (allows arbitrary direct `Reject` after `CheckApplicantRace` if not *all* are such). Directly contradicts rationale point 3 ("explicitly blocks"). Wrong tool for forbidding direct bias (no DECLARE template perfectly forbids *any* AB; closest absent, but misused here).
- **Overconstraining/Impracticality (-0.5):** `existence` forces `ManualReview`/`BiasMitigationCheck` in **every** trace (support=1.0). Ignores non-sensitive cases; prompt wants targeted fairness ("for sensitive demographics"), not universal overhead. Reduces realism.
- **Irrelevant/Redundant Additions (-0.5):** Adds `precedence(RequestAdditionalInfo, FinalDecision)` (unrelated to bias; original `succession` already implies stronger). Minor bloat.
- **Incompleteness (-0.5):** Ignores `ApplicantAge` (prompt explicitly lists). No unary/binary variety fully exploiting prompt examples (e.g., no `noncoexistence`, `alt_precedence`; no `Approve`/`Reject_Minority` variants).
- **Minor Clarity/Strictness Issues (-0.5):** Rationale overclaims (e.g., "blocks a biased path" false); coexistence symmetry unintended (forces `ManualReview`  sensitive check, illogical). Not "brief" (verbose). Model assumes unmentioned `Reject` exists without constraints.

**Net: 4.0** (good intent/creativity ~7, but critical technical/logical failures drop to failing threshold for "nearly flawless" bar).
