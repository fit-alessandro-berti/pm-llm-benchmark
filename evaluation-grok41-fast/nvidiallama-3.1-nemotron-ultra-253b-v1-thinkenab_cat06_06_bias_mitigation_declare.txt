**9.5**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Summary (for transparency, not part of grade):
- **Strengths (near-flawless aspects):** Perfect dictionary format, syntax, and preservation of original structure. All additions follow exact DECLARE nesting rules (unary/binary correctly). New activities (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`, `Reject_Minority`) directly match prompt examples. Rationales are clear, specific, numbered, and explicitly tie to bias reduction (fairness via checks/reviews). Output structure matches requirements precisely (code + explanation).
- **Minor Deductions (strict penalties):**
  - **Overly strong existence constraint:** Adding `"existence": {"BiasMitigationCheck": ...}` with `support: 1.0` mandates it *in every trace*, even non-sensitive cases. Prompt emphasizes *conditional* fairness (e.g., "for sensitive applicant", "when sensitive attributes"), not universal. Coexistence/response suffice conditionally; this is unnecessary/unintuitive overkill (-0.3). Rationale acknowledges but doesn't justify why *always* vs. triggered.
  - **Incomplete sensitive attribute coverage:** Prompt lists Age/Gender/Race explicitly; answer covers only Race (`CheckApplicantRace`). No mention/extensions for others (e.g., `CheckApplicantGender`). Examples are Race-focused, but generality implied; omission is a logical gap (-0.2).
- No major inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws (e.g., no broken syntax, wrong constraint types, conflicts with original). Correctly ignores non-relevant original activities. High but not 10.0 due to strict "even minor issues" rule.
