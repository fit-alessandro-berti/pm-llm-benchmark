### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
This answer is excellent overall—clear structure, correct logic, efficient use of CTEs, and a comprehensive explanation that maps directly to the prompt's 4 tasks. It correctly extracts ordered sequences via `STRING_AGG` (valid in DuckDB with `ORDER BY`), groups/counts variants, selects top K, and returns filtered events with proper exclusion. The final output matches exactly: all original events (`el.*`) from qualifying cases, sensibly ordered. Performance notes and usage guidance are bonuses.

**Strengths (justifying high score):**
- **Core logic flawless**: Sequence representation handles order perfectly; grouping/counting/top-K selection correct; join-based filtering excludes non-top-K cases precisely.
- **DuckDB compliance**: `STRING_AGG` with `ORDER BY` works natively.
- **Completeness**: Returns full events; maintains timestamp order in output.
- **Readability**: CTEs mirror prompt steps; detailed explanation/usage notes.

**Strict Deductions (minor but penalized heavily per instructions):**
- **Placeholder `K` (0.5 deduction)**: Query uses `LIMIT K`, which is a syntax error (unparsable as-is). Treated as template with "replace K" note and example, but prompt demands a "construct[ed] ... query"—not a non-runnable template. Hypercritical view: fails to deliver executable SQL without user edit.
- **Arbitrary delimiter `'->'` (0.1 deduction)**: Works but undocumented risk (e.g., if `activity` contains `'->'`, sequences collide falsely). Prompt doesn't forbid, but lacks robustness/mention in notes.
- **No tie-handling for top K (0.1 deduction)**: If `case_count` ties, `ORDER BY ... LIMIT K` arbitrarily selects (implementation-dependent). Prompt implies frequency-based "top K," but stable tie-breaker (e.g., `variant_sequence`) expected for precision.
- **Minor inefficiency/unnecessary join (0.1 deduction)**: `top_cases` re-joins full `case_sequences`; could use window function (`ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) <= K`) in single pass for `case_id`s, avoiding redundant aggregation. Not wrong, but not optimal.
- **Overkill ordering/documentation (no deduction, but noted)**: Final `ORDER BY` unrequired (prompt doesn't specify); verbose notes great but slightly bloated vs. lean query.

**Score Rationale**: 10.0 reserved for *nearly flawless* (runnable, robust, zero caveats). This is 98% perfect but nicked for placeholder/runtime fragility and tiny edge robustness gaps. Still benchmark-caliber.
