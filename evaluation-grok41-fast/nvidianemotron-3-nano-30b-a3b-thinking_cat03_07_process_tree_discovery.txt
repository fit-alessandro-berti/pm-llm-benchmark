**1.0**

The final boxed expression is syntactically malformed (parentheses are unbalanced and excessive at the end, with unclear nesting that doesn't parse as a valid process tree). Logically flawed: the X operator places the final sequence (AD -> SC -> AC) only in one branch, so traces taking the loop branch (* (RMI, VF)) end without executing approval, confirmation, or archival, failing to capture observed behavior where all traces end with AD -> SC -> AC. The loop * (RMI, VF) cannot produce observed traces like RMI -> VF -> AD (requires VF then back to RMI) or multiple consecutive RMI before VF. Does not balance fitness (fits some traces poorly), precision, or simplicity; ignores optional zero-iteration loop properly. Multiple inaccuracies warrant minimum score.
