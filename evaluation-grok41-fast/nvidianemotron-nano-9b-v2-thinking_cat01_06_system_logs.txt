**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (supporting score above 5)**:
  - Structure and format: Clean CSV-like table with required attributes (Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp). Explanation section clearly structured, addressing all 6 objectives (grouping logic, naming, narrative).
  - Case logic mostly coherent: Grouping by distinct document/task (e.g., Document1.docx as Case 1 spanning interruptions) is reasonable, analyst-friendly, and temporally aware. Recognizes non-closure allows resumption (e.g., Document1.docx).
  - Most activity names elevated: Good standardization (e.g., "Editing Content", "Save Document", "Send Email") over raw verbs; app-contextual where needed (e.g., "Composing Email").
  - Narrative: Tells a multitasking story effectively in explanation.

- **Major Flaws (deducting from 10)**:
  - **Incompleteness (critical, -1.5)**: Raw log has **26 events**; table has **24**. Omits:
    | Omitted Timestamp | Raw Event | Reason for Issue |
    |-------------------|-----------|------------------|
    | 2024-12-11T08:59:50.000Z | FOCUS, Quarterly_Report.docx | Orphaned; disrupts Case 5 chronology (should be "Open Document" for Case 5 at start). Arbitrary exclusion undermines "transform the provided log."
    | 2024-12-11T09:06:00.000Z | SWITCH to Document1.docx | Inconsistent; prior SWITCHes (e.g., to Chrome/Acrobat) become "Open" events, but this resumption omitted. Jumps to TYPING without transition.
    Selective filtering not explained or justified; violates full transformation.
  - **Activity Naming Inconsistencies (-0.8)**: Not fully standardized/higher-level:
    - "Scroll through Email/PDF": Barely abstracted; still low-level (could be "Review Content").
    - "Highlight Key Findings": Overly specific (raw "Text=Key Findings"); prefer generic "Highlight Content".
    - Redundant "Open Email" x2 (SWITCH + CLICK): Logical flaw; merge/differentiate (e.g., "Switch to Inbox", "Select Specific Email").
    - App-specific variance (e.g., "Open Budget Spreadsheet" vs. generic "Open Document"): Breaks standardization.
  - **Case Logic Minor Flaws (-0.3)**: Quarterly_Report.docx (Case 5) ignores initial FOCUS, implying false late-start. First event hints at early glance, but omission creates discontinuity. No derived attributes (e.g., Document/Window) despite "may include if useful."
  - **Explanation Gaps (-0.2)**: Claims all "raw actions were translated" but omits SCROLL critique/elevations. No mention of filtering rationale.

- **Why not lower?** Covers ~92% of events meaningfully; no criminal/policy violations; ready for tools (e.g., ProM/Disco importable).
- **Why not higher?** Not "nearly flawless"—omissions/logic gaps are inaccuracies preventing perfect fidelity; strict per instructions.
