The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and clear DuckDB SQL query using a CTE with `GROUP BY`, `COUNT(*)`, and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` (via alias, which DuckDB supports), followed by an INNER JOIN to retrieve all events from qualifying cases. It preserves all columns (`event_log.*`), accurately filters cases with >6 events, and handles the requirement precisely. The alternative `EXISTS` query is also logically sound and equivalent. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or deviations from the prompt; syntax is standard and DuckDB-compatible. Explanation reinforces correctness without errors.
