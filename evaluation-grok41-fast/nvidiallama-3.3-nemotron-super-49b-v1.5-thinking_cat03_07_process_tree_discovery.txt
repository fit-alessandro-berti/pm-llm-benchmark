**10.0**

The provided process tree structure is precise, complete, and directly addresses the task requirements with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. It perfectly captures all observed traces in the event log (fitness=1), prohibits unobserved behaviors (high precision), and uses the minimal necessary operators (sequence, XOR, loop with tau) for simplicity. The loop semantics (*('RMI', tau)) correctly enable 1+ consecutive 'RMI' executions followed by a single 'VF' only in the relevant branch, while the XOR handles the skip path without extraneous 'VF'. The hierarchical textual notation is unambiguous, aligns with the defined operators and example construction, and requires no execution code. All labels match the log exactly, and post-AD steps ('SC', 'AC') converge correctly after the XOR. No penalties apply.
