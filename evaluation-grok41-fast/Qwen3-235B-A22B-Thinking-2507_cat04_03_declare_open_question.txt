**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting score above 5):** Comprehensive structure with phases, table, interplay analysis, and speculation directly addressing the question. Practical real-life mappings (e.g., exactly_once for B preventing duplicate checks, noncoexistence G&A preventing premature funding, absence of Z as compliance bedrock) are insightful and mostly accurate. Ties interplay to controlled sequence, compliance (e.g., QA before authorization), and regs (FCRA, TILA, Dodd-Frank) convincingly. Speculation on business goals (risk mgmt, customer trust, post-2008 regs) and regulatory drivers is speculative yet grounded, covering transparency and audit trails effectively.
  
- **Major Deductions (strict penalties for inaccuracies/logical flaws):**
  - **Constraint misattributions (severe, -1.5):** chainsuccession wrongly stated as "F  D" (actual: E  D); chainprecedence F  B called "likely typo" but speculated as "credit recheck after authorization" – illogical for loan flow (B is early intake), undermining sequence integrity. responded_existence D  E interpreted as "D requires E" but model labels suggest reverse response direction, creating semantic confusion.
  - **Incomplete coverage (-0.8):** 19 constraint blocks listed, but ~10 ignored or glossed (e.g., coexistence C-F, response AB, chainresponse DG, altprecedence HG, nonchainsuccession FH). Question demands "each...constraints"; selective grouping excuses this.
  - **Flow visualization flaws (-0.7):** Proposed ABCEDFG/H contradicts model (e.g., no direct DF or FG; precedence EF + chainsuccession ED leaves D-F order ambiguous; chainprecedence FB loops back illogically). Breaks "structure the sequence" requirement.
  - **Minor unclarities/overstatements (-0.6):** Reg ties plausible but stretched (e.g., altsuccession CE to Bank Secrecy Act? Loose fit); table's chainprecedence "note" dodges analysis without correction. Repetitive emphasis on Z but underplays init/response as process starters.
  - **No self-corrections needed (neutral):** <think> noted issues but final answer propagates flaws (e.g., chainprecedence oddity).

Nearly flawless would require 100% accurate constraint mappings, full coverage, contradiction-free flow, and zero hedges – absent here. Score reflects strong overall but critically flawed precision.
