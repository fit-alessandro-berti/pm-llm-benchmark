**9.2**

### Explanation of Grade
The final dictionary is syntactically correct Python, includes all required keys with appropriate types (sets of tuples for pairwise constraints, dict of activity-to-int-set for `activ_freq`), covers all 10 activities, and logically captures a strict linear sequence RO  CA  RI  PI  QC  PO  GSL  D  IC  RP via `directly_follows` (flawless) and `activ_freq` (all `{1}`, reasonable for mandatory unique steps in the described process).

- **Strengths (no penalties)**:
  - `directly_follows`: Perfect—exactly the 9 consecutive pairs.
  - `activ_freq`: Perfect—enforces exactly once per activity, aligning with "must be processed through a series of activities."
  - `equivalence`: Empty set correct—no linked occurrence counts mentioned.
  - `never_together`: Empty set correct—no mutual exclusions in scenario.
  - Structure: Valid, concise, no extras/missing activities.

- **Minor deductions (-0.5 total)**:
  - `always_before`: Correctly uses reverse-direct pairs (e.g., `('CA', 'RO')` enforces RO before CA per definition: if CA occurs, RO previously). But strictly incomplete—transitive pairs missing (e.g., `('RI', 'RO')`: if RI occurs, RO must precede). Chain + freq indirectly enforces, but declarative model should explicitly cover for hyper-strictness.
  - `always_after`: Correctly uses direct-forward pairs (e.g., `('RO', 'CA')` enforces CA after RO per definition: if RO occurs, CA in following events). Same incompleteness—transitive missing (e.g., `('RO', 'RI')`: RI sometime after RO). Redundant with `directly_follows` + freq, but definition warrants broader set; limiting to directs is pragmatic but not fully precise.

Nearly flawless (precise for minimal viable model, no errors/logical contradictions), but transitive omissions prevent 10.0 under hypercritical lens. High score reflects practical excellence for scenario.
