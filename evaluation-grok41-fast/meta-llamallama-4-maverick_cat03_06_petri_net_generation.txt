**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Fundamental Logical Flaws in Petri Net Semantics (Severe Deduction: -4.5)**: Multiple transitions (e.g., `fraud_check` with inputs from `after_dv`, `after_rds`, `after_ii`; `claim_assessment` with inputs from `after_fc`, `after_ii`) have **multiple input places**. In standard Petri nets, this enforces **AND-join** semantics (token required in *all* input places to enable firing), not OR/XOR as intended for process choices/loops. Result: key transitions like FC and CA are **never fireable** (impossible to have simultaneous tokens in disjoint paths), making the net deadlocked/incapable of reaching `end` from `start`. This renders the entire model non-functional for the scenario—catastrophic inaccuracy.
  
- **Incorrect Loop Modeling for DV-RDS (Major Deduction: -1.5)**: Task explicitly requires "loops (e.g., between DV and RDS)". Code allows only *one* RDS (after_dv  RDS  after_rds  FC), with no back-arc to `document_verification` or `after_dv`. Cannot model "re-submission if documents need re-submission" multiple times. Direct to FC after RDS contradicts logical re-verification expectation.

- **Missing Conditional Logic for AP (Major Deduction: -0.8)**: Scenario states AP "must be approved... *if* the amount surpasses a certain threshold" (explicitly conditional). Code forces linear CA  AP  P (no choice/skip to P), violating process description. Inconsistent with choice modeling elsewhere.

- **Omits Initial "Insurance Claim (C)" Activity (Minor-Major Deduction: -0.5)**: Scenario starts with bolded "**Insurance Claim (C)**, after which...". No transition/place for C; jumps to CR. Start place vaguely proxies, but task lists C as part of activities.

- **Syntax/Construction Correct but Superfluous (Minor Credit/Offset: +0.3)**: Correct use of `PetriNet`, `Marking`, `petri_utils.add_arc_from_to`. Labels match activity names. `im[start]=1`, `fm[end]=1` perfect. Places/transitions added properly.

- **Unnecessary Wrapper & Output (Minor Deduction: -0.2)**: Function wrapper and `print` statements bloat code beyond task's direct construction example (e.g., no function/prints needed). Minor unclarity.

- **Partial Credit for Intent (Base: +4.0, then deductions)**: Attempts choices (e.g., after_dv split, FC-II loop intent), sequential end (PNCL), pm4py API. Explanation text accurate to code but ignores flaws. II loop structure conceptually closer (but broken by multi-input).

**Overall**: Syntactically valid code, but logically/ semantically **broken net** fails core task ("logical sequence with possible loops"). Not "nearly flawless"—major inaccuracies prevent acceptance as accepting Petri net. Strict ceiling at 3.2.
