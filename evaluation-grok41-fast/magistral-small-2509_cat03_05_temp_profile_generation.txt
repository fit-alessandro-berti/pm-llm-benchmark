**7.0**

### Reasoning for Grade
The final output is a properly formatted Python dictionary with correct tuple keys (ordered pairs where the first activity precedes the second in the implied sequential process) and value tuples (average_time, standard_deviation), all using seconds as in the example. It includes a representative subset (15 pairs) ensuring complexity: all 9 consecutive pairs, plus 6 non-consecutive pairs spanning 1–9 steps (e.g., short skip `('SS', 'RC')`, medium `('SS', 'CA')`, long `('SS', 'AS')`), demonstrating understanding of "eventually following" in traces.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Major logical flaws in numerical consistency**: Averages for non-consecutive pairs do not align with sums of consecutive-pair averages, violating the sequential temporal model (e.g., for trace `<SS,OP,RC,QI,CA,PT,...>`, time(OP,PT) should  sum(OPRC + RCQI + QICA + CAPT) = 604800 + 86400×3 = 864000, but given as 345600—a 60% error. Similarly, RCPK = 86400×4 = 345600 but given 432000 (+25%); SSRC 691200 but 720000 (+4%); SSAS 1,470,400 (17 days) but 1,728,000 (+18%)). These are not rounding; they indicate flawed estimation logic for cumulative times.
- **Std dev approximations inconsistent**: Some match quadrature sum dominant var (e.g., SSRC std 172800), but others arbitrary (e.g., RCPK std=100000 despite small-variance steps, ignoring additivity (3600²×4)7200).
- **No unclarities or syntax issues**, but logical inaccuracies in core modeling (additive expectations for linear traces) prevent "nearly flawless." Minor issues alone would deduct sharply; multiples cap at mid-high score despite strong structure/variety/plausibility.
