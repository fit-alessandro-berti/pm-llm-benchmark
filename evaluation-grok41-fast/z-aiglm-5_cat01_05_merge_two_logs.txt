**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**:
  - **Complete Coverage**: All 10 input events are accounted for without duplication or omission (4 merges + 1 B-only + 1 A-only = 6 unified records). Non-overlapping events (Quality Check, Item Delivered) correctly kept separate with origin indicated.
  - **Chronological Order**: Perfectly sorted by primary (Log A) timestamp, as required.
  - **Attribute Integration**: Flawlessly combines attributes (e.g., user_id, resource_id, notes from B into A's sparser records). Missing data handled clearly with "—". Dual timestamps preserved for transparency.
  - **Output Format**: Table is clear, professional, self-documenting (columns for primary/secondary timestamps, unified name, source). Easy to audit.
  - **Reasoning Section**: Exhaustive, structured, and directly addresses prompt requirements. Details exact time diffs, semantic justifications, conflict resolutions (e.g., unified names prefer A), and methodology (primary timeline priority). Explicitly handles "slightly offset" via context (e.g., payment delay note).
  - **Semantic Matching**: Excellent (e.g., "OrderReceived"  "Order Received"; "Shipping"  "Item Shipped"). Confident but not overreaching except noted below.

- **Flaws/Deductions (Strict Penalties)**:
  - **Payment Merge Violates Tolerance (Major Logical Flaw, -0.5)**: Timestamps differ by **5 seconds** (A: 10:02:00Z, B: 10:02:05Z), exceeding the prompt's "small timestamp tolerance (e.g., if timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds)". While "e.g." allows interpretation and semantics/notes justify it plausibly, hypercritical strictness demands adherence to the explicit guideline for "confident" matching. This is not "<2s" (other merges are 1-2s); borderline overreach risks false positive merge. Should have left separate or flagged as low-confidence.
  - **Minor Unclarity in Unified Names (-0.2)**: "Payment Processed" (A) overrides "PaymentCheck" (B) cleanly, but subtle semantic gap ("Processed" implies completion vs. "Check" as verification) not fully caveated—could confuse if "Check" failed (though notes mitigate).
  - **Nitpicky Formatting (-0.1)**: Notes in table lack original quotes (e.g., "Event captured..." vs. `"Event captured..."`), reducing fidelity. "—" for missing fields is good but inconsistent with potential null standardization.

- **Overall**: Nearly flawless execution (comprehensive, logical, enriched log meets all specs). Single tolerance deviation prevents perfect 10.0; still exceptional vs. minimum requirements. No other inaccuracies, gaps, or ambiguities.
