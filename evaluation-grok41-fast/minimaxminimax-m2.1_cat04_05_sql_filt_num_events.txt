The provided answer is nearly flawless. The primary query correctly uses a subquery with `GROUP BY case_id` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to identify qualifying cases, then filters the full event rows via `WHERE case_id IN (...)`, selecting the exact relevant columns (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`). This precisely matches the requirements: excludes cases with >6 events, returns complete events for cases with 6 events total, with proper grouping and aggregate filtering.

The CTE alternative is equivalent, readable, and uses a standard `INNER JOIN`. Explanations are accurate (e.g., `HAVING` vs. `WHERE`, identical results), concise, and highlight key SQL concepts without errors. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or DuckDB incompatibilities. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., column aliases in CTE) are optimal, not penalizable.
