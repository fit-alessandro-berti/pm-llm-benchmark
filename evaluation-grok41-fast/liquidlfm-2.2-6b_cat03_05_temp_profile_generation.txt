**1.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Invalid Python Syntax (Fatal Flaw)**: The code does not define a functional dictionary. It lists keys without colons (`:`), values, or closing braces properly. This is not executable Python; it would raise a `SyntaxError`. No `temporal_profile` variable is usable.
- **Missing Core Requirement - No Numerical Values**: The prompt explicitly demands values as tuples `(average_time, standard_deviation)` with estimated numbers (e.g., seconds, as in the example `{('A', 'B'): (86400, 3600)}`). Zero values provided; comments vaguely approximate times (e.g., "~72 hours") but these are not in the dict. This alone disqualifies it entirely.
- **Incorrect Key Format**: Keys use verbose full names like `('Supplier Selection (SS)', 'Order Placement (OP)')` instead of required short labels `('SS', 'OP')`. Example in prompt is explicit: "tuples of activity labels (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`)".
- **Incomplete/Non-Representative Pairs**: Lists ~20 malformed entries, but many duplicates (e.g., `('Component Assembly (CA)', 'Product Testing (PT)')` twice; `('Receive Components (RC)', 'Quality Inspection (QI)')` twice). Fails to cover "pairs of activities that eventually follow each other" systematically (e.g., no SSAS, OPPK spans; ignores most multi-step like SSPT, RCDT). Includes illogical/reverse pairs violating process order (e.g., `('Distribution (DT)', 'Warehouse Storage (WS)')`—WS precedes DT; `('After-Sales Support (AS)', 'Distribution (DT)')`—AS follows DT; `('Product Testing (PT)', 'Supplier Selection (SS)')`—cycle-breaking speculation). Prompt assumes forward "eventually follow each other in at least one process execution."
- **Logical Flaws in Content**: Comments justify nonsense (e.g., "backwards dependencies... for resilience modeling"—temporal profile is for sequential followers, not cycles/returns). Edge cases like ASPK are speculative fiction, not "representative subset" of supply chain traces. No averages/std devs computed/estimated rigorously; just ad-hoc guesses.
- **Unclear/Irrelevant Additions**: Header comments like "# (Supply Chain Stage, Next Activity)" mislead (many not "next"). Explanation section is extraneous prose, not part of the dict, and doubles down on flawed rationale (e.g., "multi-step... over multiple processes"—temporal profile is per-trace pairs within executions).
- **No Complexity as Specified**: Claims "multi-step dependencies" but delivers broken list without numerical variance modeling (e.g., no STDEV reflecting "various factors like supplier lead times"). Fails "ensuring complexity by considering pairs... separated by multiple steps."

Nearly every aspect fails the prompt. This is not a "temporal profile" dict but broken pseudocode with errors. No credit for intent; output is unusable.
