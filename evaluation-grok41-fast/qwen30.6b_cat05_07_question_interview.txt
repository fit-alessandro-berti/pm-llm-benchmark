**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: The list is well-structured as a numbered series of 10 targeted, open-ended questions directly addressing the prompt's goals (missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, exceptions). It covers all required areas comprehensively without requesting SQL or overtly technical implementations. Questions are conceptual, interviewee-focused ("you," "how do you"), and build on the described process (e.g., #1 on docs/compliance, #5 on exceptions/insurance/clauses, #10 on sequencing/timeline). No criminal/offensive content issues. Final summary sentence reinforces purpose without fluff.
  
- **Flaws (strict deductions)**:
  - **#7 (major flaw, -1.0)**: "what tools or processes are used?" explicitly requests "tools," which violates "no implementation details" (tools imply specific software/systems, not pure concepts). Processes are borderline conceptual, but paired with tools, it's non-compliant.
  - **Repetition/overlap (-0.3)**: #3 and #9 both probe communication flows (#3: regional office/manager/landlord transparency; #9: feedback/stakeholder tracking), reducing efficiency/distinctiveness.
  - **Inaccuracy/phrasing issues (-0.3)**: #2 mangles original ("furnished vs. furnished/special housing" – unclear/typo-ridden vs. source "furnished rentals, luxury units, student housing"). #4 assumes "property manager visit" (source specifies *scheduling* photographer/inspector, not manager's visit), introducing unsubstantiated detail.
  - **Minor overreach (-0.2)**: Categorization (e.g., **Missing Details**) adds unrequested structure, potentially verbose; #6/#8 touch IT/financial "internal systems"/audits, skirting implementation vibes though staying conceptual.

- **Overall**: Nearly flawless coverage and adherence (90%+ ideal), but #7's direct violation + minor inaccuracies/phrasing prevent 9+. Deductions total ~1.8 from 10.0 base for strictness.
