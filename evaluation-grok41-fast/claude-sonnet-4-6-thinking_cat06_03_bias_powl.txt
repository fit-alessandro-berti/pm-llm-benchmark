**9.7**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
This answer is exceptionally strong—comprehensive, directly responsive, logically rigorous, and insightfully structured with visuals, tables, code, and frameworks. It precisely identifies the XOR-induced bias (unequal paths post-C, with D conferring unearned uplift to "local affiliates" vs. skip for others), links it to proxy discrimination, and deeply discusses fairness/equity implications (individual/group/procedural violations, propagation to thresholds, systemic loops, regulatory risks). Remediation elevates it beyond the question's scope without detracting. **Nearly flawless**, warranting a very high score.

**Minor deductions (-0.3 total, strictly enforced):**
- **Formatting/typo unclarities** (-0.2): Section 3.1 has malformed diagram text ("BaseScore +     E    F"; likely intended "+ uplift"), and 3.2 has "648+  APPROVED" (incomplete uplift notation). These create momentary parsing ambiguity, violating clarity.
- **Minor over-assumptions** (-0.1): Hypothetical scores (e.g., 648 + uplift > threshold) and underwriter "sees already-modified score" are logically sound inferences from the prompt's "subtle score uplift" comment but introduce unstated specifics (uplift magnitude, exact E visibility). No contradiction, but hypercritically, not 100% grounded in provided code/comments alone.

No inaccuracies (correctly interprets XOR selection as affiliation-based proxy, propagation to F, non-protected proxy risks), no logical flaws (counterfactuals airtight, disparate impact analysis precise), no omissions (covers all question angles). Zero criminal/unsafe content. Easily merits 10.0 absent these trivial slips.
