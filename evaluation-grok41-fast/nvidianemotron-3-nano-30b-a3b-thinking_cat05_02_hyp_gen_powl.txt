**6.2**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting >5.0)**: 
  - **Part 1 (Anomalies)**: Nearly flawless. 4 anomalies accurately identified with precise code references, clear explanations tied to ideal flow, and why they deviate. Tables/visuals enhance clarity. No logical flaws; POWL semantics correctly interpreted (e.g., LOOP allows exit but repeats; partial order lacks enforcement for concurrency/prematurity).
  - **Part 2 (Hypotheses)**: Excellent – 6 varied, plausible hypotheses in table format, each with explanation and manifestation link. Covers business, human, technical causes creatively yet realistically. No inaccuracies.
  - **Structure/Completeness**: Perfect matching of task (sections 1-3), summary, "putting it together" table. References schema indirectly well; suggests extensions (e.g., regions). Comprehensive.
  - **Ignore think/flow**: Followed; only final answer graded.

- **Fatal Flaws (capping at 6.2, not higher)**:
  - **Part 3 (Queries)**: Core task failure due to inaccuracies/unrunnable SQL. Strict penalty as verification is ~1/3 weight and explicitly requires "write database queries... against tables" that "identify claims closed without proper eval/approval, multiple approves, skipped N".
    | Query | Issues |
    |-------|--------|
    | **3.1 (Premature closure)** | **Unrunnable + wrong logic**. `ce_eval.seq`/`ce_approve.seq` reference non-existent `seq` (only in CTE; `claim_events` lacks it). INNER JOINs require **both** E **and** P before C (normal cases). WHERE detects **presence** before C (opposite of "closed **before** proper eval/approval"). Misses goal; selects compliant traces. |
    | **3.2 (Multiple approves)** | Flawless. Detects loops perfectly. |
    | **3.3 (Skipped N)** | **Messy + buggy**. `n.event_id IS NULL` catches no-N claims (good), but OR `NOT EXISTS` references undefined outer `c_e.timestamp`; convoluted logic (searches N after C?). LEFT JOINs on `claim_id` risk row explosion (multiple N/C). Doesn't cleanly prove "skip" vs. missing data. |
    | **3.4 (Early close)** | Solid (uses MIN timestamps correctly for first-occurrence violation). |
    | **3.5 (Loop pattern)** | Good intent (LAG detects PE), but raw SELECT lacks aggregation/filter (e.g., COUNT WHERE prev='P' AND activity='E' >0). Manual interp needed. |
    - Overall: 3/5 queries broken/wrong; ignores `adjusters`/`claims` joins mostly (e.g., no `claim_type`/`region` filters). No full "suite" execution example. "Representative sample" vague (no LIMIT/DATE filter).
  - **Minor issues (further deductions)**: Anomaly 4 slightly speculative ("some POWL semantics"); 3.1 comment mismatches query; summary claims "concrete statistics" but queries don't aggregate (%/counts). No edge cases (NULL timestamps, concurrent events).
  
- **Why not lower?** Half queries work; structure/parts 1-2 exemplary. Why not higher? Broken SQL is "inaccuracy" in key deliverable – "significantly lower"; not "nearly flawless." Equivalent to submitting non-compiling code.
