**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (partial credit basis):** Correctly identifies Case 2 as the sole normative violator and accurately explains *two* of its three major violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection). Correctly identifies all three desiderata issues in Case 3 (credit check delay, inform delay, no follow-up). Provides plausible interpretations/justifications overall, tied to process improvements. Structure is clear and covers all task parts superficially. Case 1 correctly not flagged for normative violations (implied).
- **Major Inaccuracies/Factual Errors (severe deductions):**
  - **Missed critical normative violation in Case 2:** No "Inform Applicant" event exists after Loan Decision (required universally post-decision, before close, per sequence and "must be informed"). This is a clear skip of a mandatory step ("skipping activities... not allowed"), comparable in severity to the caught violations. Omitting it makes the analysis incomplete and undermines Task 1.
  - **Invented desiderata violation in Case 1:** Falsely claims "Inform Applicant" at 13:00 is "4 hours after" 11:00 Loan Decision (actual: 2 hours) *and* "not within the recommended 48-hour window" (2 hours < 48 hours; even their erroneous "4 hours" is <48). This is a double factual error (miscalculation + illogical conclusion), creating a non-existent violation. Case 1 timings are *exemplary* (credit check in 30 min; inform in 2 hours), so this misrepresents the log.
- **Logical Flaws/Unclarities (significant deductions):**
  - Task 2 requires clarifying desiderata as "not severe, suboptimal." Done vaguely ("while not a strict rule"), but applied to a *fake* Case 1 issue, propagating error.
  - Task 3 interpretations/justifications reference non-issues (e.g., Case 1 "delay in informing" and "communication channels... overwhelmed" for a 2-hour non-delay) and ignore the missed Inform skip in Case 2. Case 1/2 also lack Follow-up Call (desiderata applies universally; log notes it only for Case 3, but implied for all), unaddressed.
  - Minor: Duplicate "Case 2:" headers under normative; no explicit "Case 1/3 compliant with normative" statement (implied but unclear); interpretations for Case 2 don't cover the missed Inform skip.
- **Overall:** ~60% accurate on violations (2/3 normative in Case 2 caught; all Case 3 desiderata; but +1 fake). Flaws are not minor (missed mandatory step; fabricated violation with math/logic error)—they distort conclusions. Not "nearly flawless"; mid-low score reflects partial utility despite errors.
