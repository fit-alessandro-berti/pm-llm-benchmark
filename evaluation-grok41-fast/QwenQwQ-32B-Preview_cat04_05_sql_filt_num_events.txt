The final query is logically correct, efficiently uses a window function with CTE for readability and performance in DuckDB, correctly filters cases to retain only events from those with 6 events total, and returns all original columns (plus one extra). The structured explanation clearly describes the approach without errors.

Minor deduction for including the extraneous `event_count` column in the output (via `SELECT *`), which augments the "full set of events" beyond the original schema. A flawless version would exclude it (e.g., via the equivalent `IN` subquery: `SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6);`), preserving exact original rows without additions. This is a small but unnecessary deviation under hypercritical scrutiny.
