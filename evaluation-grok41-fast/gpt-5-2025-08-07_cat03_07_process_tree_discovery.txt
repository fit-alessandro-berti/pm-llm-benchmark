**9.2**

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (supporting high score):**
- **Fitness (10/10)**: Perfectly replays all traces in the log. Case 2 (no loop): outer loop executes tau then exits  AE  AD directly. Case 1: one outer iteration with inner loop doing one RMI  RMI  VF. Case 3: one outer iteration with inner loop doing RMI  tau  RMI  exit  VF. Visible traces match exactly; silents (tau) hide appropriately.
- **Captures required behavior (10/10)**: Main sequence (RA  VF  AE  AD  SC  AC), optional repeating RMI (1+ per block via inner *), single re-VF per block, optional block entirely.
- **Simplicity (9/10)**: Concise nested structure using minimal nodes/operators; leverages tau elegantly for optionality/repetition without unnecessary X or +.
- **Notation (10/10)**: Matches prompt's textual syntax precisely (e.g., ->( 'label', ... ), single quotes, nesting, tau unquoted as indicated).
- **Label accuracy (10/10)**: Exact full names from log, including abbreviations in parens.

**Weaknesses (deductions for strictness; no flaw is overlooked):**
- **Precision (8/10  -0.8 total)**: Allows unseen behaviors, e.g., multiple remediation blocks like AE  RMI  VF  RMI  RMI  VF  AD (two re-VF). Log shows at most *one* re-VF (after 1-2 RMI); no evidence for repeating "re-validation" blocks. Scenario mentions "repetitions of requesting missing info *and* re-validation," but log contradicts re-validation repeating—logical overgeneralization harms precision balance. A X(tau, ->(*('RMI', tau), 'VF')) post-AE would be strictly precise (0 or exactly one block with 1+ RMI  VF), but this uses outer * unnecessarily.
- **Unclarity/Logical subtlety (-0.2)**: Inner *('RMI', tau) mandates silents *between* RMIs (after each but last), which works but is non-standard (typical repeat is *(tau, 'RMI') for 0+ or adjusted for 1+). Unnecessary for consecutive RMIs in log (timestamps close, no visible intervening activity), though invisible. Outer tau-first loop is idiomatic but adds complexity permitting extras.
- **Minor notation pedantry (-0.1)**: tau consistently unquoted (prompt okays), but strict parsing might expect 'tau' symmetry with labels; no functional issue.

**Overall**: Nearly flawless (exceptional for small log/discovery task), but precision flaw (unseen multi-re-VF) and subtle loop design prevent 10.0—hypercritical deduction ensures balance not assumed perfect. Equivalent to A-grade in discovery metrics (high fitness/simplicity, good-but-not-elite precision).
