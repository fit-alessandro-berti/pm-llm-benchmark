**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It fully complies with all requirements: correct Case ID usage (`order_id`), precise activity derivation (exactly matching suggested names and granularity, e.g., per-line "Item Picked", per-delivery dispatch/arrive, per-invoice/payment), accurate timestamps with perfect chronological ordering within each case, comprehensive resource resolution using the Resources table (logical carrier assignment for deliveries; appropriate "External/Unknown" for payments lacking data), rich yet relevant Other Attributes (cross-table enrichment from Orders, Products, etc., without bloat), inclusion of *every* available event across *all* order_ids (notably handling incomplete cases like 1004 correctly, without fabrication), and Markdown table format. Assumptions are explicitly documented, logical, and minimal. No inaccuracies, logical flaws, missing events, chronological violations, or ambiguities. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., semicolon-separated attributes, table sorting by case-then-time) are standard for event logs and unimpeachable. The optional extras add value without detracting. No deductions warranted.
