The answer correctly identifies the violating cases (2, 3, and 5) with precise alignment to the normative description's sequences and constraints. Case 1 and 4 are accurately cleared as compliant. Explanations reference the text directly (e.g., "directly proceed to Cancel," "never after a cancellation," "after authorization and before shipment"), interpret ambiguities well (e.g., Authorize before Cancel implies violating "sufficient inventory" precondition and "directly" clause), and use superior formatting (table, partial-order LaTeX) for clarity. Violations are logically dissected per case with no missed issues (e.g., Case 5's mandatory Package skip; Case 2's ordering reversal; Case 3's dual Ship-after-Cancel and Authorize-in-cancel-path errors).

Minor deduction (-0.8) for one imprecise phrasing in Case 2 table ("violates both 'payment-after-check' and 'package-after-authorisation'"), as Check  Package  Authorize still satisfies Authorize-after-Check (only Authorize-before-Package is breached). This is a non-critical wording slip amid otherwise flawless logic, but noted per strict criteria. No other inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws; conclusions are impeccable.
