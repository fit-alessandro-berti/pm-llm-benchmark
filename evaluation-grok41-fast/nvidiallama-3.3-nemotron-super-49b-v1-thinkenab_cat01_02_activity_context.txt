**7.0**

### Explanation of Grade (for transparency, not part of response):
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: Correctly identifies all recurring activities per case (Verify Documents in C001/C003; Call Customer in C002). Revised log presented in clear table format matching original structure. Renames for recurring instances are accurate and contextually justified (e.g., Initial/Document Re-verification in C001; Account Clarification/Adjustment Confirmation in C002; Physical/Post-Adjustment in C003). Justification section is concise, ties directly to contextual clues (position, descriptions, resources), and includes solid disambiguation logic.
- **Weaknesses (strict deductions)**: 
  - Major inaccuracy: C001's single-occurrence "Call Customer" wrongly renamed to "Account Clarification Call" (mismatches context of requesting missing docs; copies C002's unrelated "account discrepancy" purpose). This introduces inconsistency between activity name and its own row's context.
  - Logical flaw in scope: Task specifies renaming for activities recurring *within the same case*. Yet singles renamed inconsistently (C001 Call wrongly; C003 Call aptly but unnecessarily; C002 Verify correctly left alone).
  - Minor unclarities: Inconsistent bolding in tables (some renames bolded, C001 erroneous rename not). No justification for the erroneous/ extra renames. Slight markdown alignment issues (extra spaces in some cells).
- **Overall**: Strong core execution (~85% flawless), but the blatant contextual mismatch and scope overreach prevent "nearly flawless" status, warranting deduction under hypercritical criteria. Equivalent to B-/C+ in academic terms.
