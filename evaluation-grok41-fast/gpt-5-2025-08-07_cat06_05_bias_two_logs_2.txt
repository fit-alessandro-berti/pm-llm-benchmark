**9.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—concise, structured, directly responsive to the question (identifying Group B, explaining manifestation, implications for fairness/equity), evidence-based (specific CaseIDs, scores, counterfactuals), and extends insightfully to root causes/better practices without straying. It correctly infers hiring threshold (~60 vs. 65) from data patterns across groups. Logical flow is airtight, no contradictions.

**Strengths (Justifying High Score):**
- **Accuracy (flawless)**: Precisely IDs Group B as biased; quotes exact boosts/outcomes (e.g., U003 5863, U001 6065); ties to Group A disparities (e.g., P002/U002 at 60 rejected despite comparable/superior scores).
- **Clarity/Completeness**: Bullet structure mirrors question; manifestation explicitly links non-uniform adjustment to outcome changes; unfairness/implications cover process-level bias, proxy discrimination, legal/equity risks.
- **Logical Rigor**: Counterfactuals valid (e.g., "without boost, likely Not Hired"); notes small-sample hire rates similarity to emphasize *process* bias over outcomes; identifies proxy via association/local access.
- **Depth**: Adds homophily/nepotism, validity erosion, audits—relevant without fluff.

**Minor Deductions (Strict/Hypercritical—Preventing 10.0):**
- **Slight unclarity in phrasing (0.3 deduct)**: "U001: Cultural fit 60 becomes 65 Hired; the adjustment likely moved..."—omits explicit table progression (CulturalFitCheck 60  FinalInterview 65), assuming reader recalls; minor but could be "58 +5 63 (as shown in FinalInterview/HiringDecision)".
- **Tiny overgeneralization (0.2 deduct)**: "others at 60 were rejected"—true (P002/U002), but doesn't note all 60s rejected *across groups*, strengthening cross-group comparison; pedantic, but strictness demands explicitness.
- No factual errors, ambiguities, or flaws warranting >0.5 total deduct—**nearly flawless**, but perfection requires zero nits.
