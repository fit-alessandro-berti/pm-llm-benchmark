**8.2**

The answer correctly identifies **Group B's log** as exhibiting bias, accurately attributing it to the **+10 ScoreAdjustment** ("Community Boost") triggered by **CommunityGroup** (present in U001/U003), which is absent in Group A's log (all "None"). It properly notes **LocalResident** (TRUE in B, FALSE in A) as contextual but ties the mechanism correctly to CommunityGroup. The explanation of **systematic differences** is mostly sound: favoritism to B enables approvals for lower preliminary scores (e.g., U003: 695705 approved), disadvantaging A without boosts, with relevant examples like U001 vs. P001 and hypotheticals grounded in data.

**Strengths (supporting high score):**
- Precise conclusion: Bias favors unprotected B via unequal adjustments, disadvantaging protected A; B's log "explicitly documents" it.
- Structured analysis with observations, disparities, attribute impacts.
- Correct approval logic for cases (e.g., U002 mirrors P002 at 710 rejected sans boost).
- No factual errors in data transcription or group labels.

**Strict deductions (hypercritical flaws lowering from 10.0/9.5):**
- **Vague/ inaccurate threshold (major unclarity, -1.0):** Claims "effective cutoff 700–720" and "~720 for A," but data shows A rejects at 710 (P002), while B approves at 705 adjusted (U003). Range dodges this; no single threshold explains it without admitting per-group bias. Should specify: A implies 720 approve (710 reject), B approves <710 post-adjust (705), proving favoritism.
- **Missed direct comparison (logical gap, -0.6):** Hypotheticals (e.g., "Group B with 710 +10=720 approved" vs. P002 710) are valid but weaker than actual **P002 (710 rejected) vs. U003 (705 approved)**—B approved at *lower final score*. This "smoking gun" for post-adjustment bias is omitted, weakening "systematic disparities."
- **Minor overreach (slight inaccuracy, -0.2):** U001 vs. P001 "both approved, but adjustment ensures higher"—true but irrelevant (both pass anyway); dilutes focus. "Stricter threshold" for A implied but not quantified sharply.

Nearly flawless in identification/conclusion (flawless there), but analytical gaps prevent 9+. Solid professional response, just not surgically precise.
