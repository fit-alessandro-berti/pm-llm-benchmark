**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless: it precisely fulfills all three tasks with accurate timestamp-based calculations (all durations correctly approximated and verifiable), correctly identifies outliers (102, 104, 105) by direct comparison to fast cases (101, 103), pinpoints root causes with granular evidence (escalations in 102/105, idle gaps in all slow cases, overnight spillovers, minor triage delays), and delivers tightly linked insights/recommendations that are actionable, prioritized, and directly remedial (e.g., SLAs, alerts, on-call). No inaccuracies, ambiguities, logical gaps, or unsubstantiated claims; structure is exemplary, analysis exhaustive yet concise.
