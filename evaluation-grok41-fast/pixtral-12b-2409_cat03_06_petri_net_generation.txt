**4.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (partial credit only)**:
  - Correct imports and basic setup (PetriNet, Marking, petri_utils).
  - All relevant places and transitions defined and added with appropriate names/labels matching scenario activities.
  - Initial (im[start]=1) and final (fm[end]=1) markings correct.
  - DV-RDS loop correctly modeled: dv place splits to RDS trans  rds  DV trans  dv (multiple iterations possible, then to FC).
  - Basic linear flow from start  CR  cr  DV  dv  FC  fc mostly intact.
  - Extra print statements harmless (not required but don't break anything).

- **Major Inaccuracies/Logical Flaws (severe deductions)**:
  - **FC-II loop fundamentally broken**: fc  II trans  ca (direct to CA place, no loop back). No choice from fc place (always II, no direct to CA trans despite "if raises doubts"). ii place has outgoing arc (ii  FC trans) but **no incoming arc** (dead place/arc). Cannot loop multiple times as required; violates scenario.
  - **AP conditional not modeled**: assess_claim (CA)  ap  P trans **skips AP trans entirely** (no firing of "Approval" activity). approve_claim trans added but **dangling (no in/out arcs)**. No split after CA for "if amount surpasses threshold" (should branch ap or skip to P). Linear flow incorrectly bypasses required activity.
  - **End sequence invalid/broken**: n  cl (**place-to-place arc: runtime error**). cl  end (**another place-to-place arc: runtime error**). close_claim trans dangling (no arcs). Code **will not execute** without exceptions. No valid path to fire CL and reach end reliably.
  - **No choices for conditionals**: Scenario requires optional branches (DVRDS?, FCII?, CAAP?). Only DV split correct; others missing (single paths force mandatory II/AP skips).
  - **Dangling/unused elements**: approve_claim, close_claim transitions; ii place/arcs waste resources, indicate poor design.
  - **Incomplete process coverage**: No transition for initial "Insurance Claim (C)" (minor, as start implies it), but AP/FC/II/CL not properly reachable/fireable. Token cannot reach fm[end] due to invalid arcs.
  - **Unclear/inconsistent naming/flow**: Places named after activities (e.g., ca after II but before CA trans?), but II  ca skips FC decision logic.

- **Overall**: ~40% functional (basic chain + one loop), but critical paths (fraud, approval, closure) fail logically/syntactically. Not runnable, doesn't accept all traces (no choices/loops), violates scenario. Far from "nearly flawless" (requires perfect flow, no errors, full optionals/loops). Strict deduction: starts at 10, -6 for breaks/unrunnable.
