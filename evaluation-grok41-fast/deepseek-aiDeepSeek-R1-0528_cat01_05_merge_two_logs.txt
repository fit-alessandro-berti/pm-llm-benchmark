**9.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This grade reflects a near-flawless execution, with only minor, non-fatal deductions for two issues under utmost strictness. Strengths dominate: comprehensive merging, perfect inclusion of all events/attributes, logical structure, chronological ordering, and detailed reasoning. The final output (table + reasoning) fully addresses the task without loss of data.

#### Flawless Aspects (Full Credit):
- **Matching Logic (Core Task)**: Precisely identifies semantic pairs (e.g., "Order Received"  "OrderReceived", "Item Shipped"  "Shipping") using order_id + timing. Correctly rejects Payment events (5s > tolerance). Includes all non-overlapping events (Quality Check, Item Delivered). Unifies into single rows for matches.
- **Attribute Integration**: All fields preserved/enriched (both timestamps, event types, user_id, etc.). Missing values clearly marked (—), no data loss.
- **Timestamps & Ordering**: Primary_timestamp coherently defined (Log A priority for availability, else Log B). Ordering is strictly chronological by it. Both timestamps retained for transparency.
- **Output Format**: Table is professional, readable, chronological. Reasoning section methodically documents matches/unmatches, tolerance, conflicts, resolutions—directly fulfills "document your reasoning."
- **Handling Edge Cases**: Tolerates "slight offsets" sensibly; enriches Log A with Log B metadata; indicates origins implicitly via fields.
- **Comprehensiveness**: All 5 Log A + 5 Log B = 7 merged/unique events. No omissions/duplicates.

#### Minor Deductions (Hypercritical; Total -0.5):
1. **Tolerance Interpretation (-0.2)**: Prompt specifies "less than 2 seconds" (strict <2s). Answer uses "2 seconds (inclusive)" and matches exactly 2s diffs (e.g., Order Received: precisely 2s; Shipping: 2s). While justified semantically/reasonably (prompt's "e.g." allows flexibility, names align perfectly), it's a logical deviation from literal wording. No penalty if corrected self, but final states inclusive explicitly.
2. **Origin Indication (-0.3)**: Prompt requires "indicating its origin" for solo events. Table infers via field presence (e.g., timestamp_A present  Log A), but lacks explicit "source" field/label (e.g., "Log A only", "merged"). Readable but not explicit—minor unclarity.

No other inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws: No logical gaps, no invented data, no poor ordering, no ignored requirements. Easily 10.0 without these nitpicks; 9.5 enforces "even minor issues significantly lower" while recognizing excellence.
