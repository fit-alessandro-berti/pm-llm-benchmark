**6.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
**Strengths (supporting the score):**
- Strong overall structure: Uses tables for clarity, systematically addresses all three task parts, distinguishes normative (strict) from desiderata (recommended), and provides interpretations/justifications as required.
- Correctly identifies Case 1 as fully compliant.
- Accurately flags Case 2's core normative violations: Risk Assessment before Credit Check (ordering violation), Finalize Documentation after rejection (contradictory action).
- Correctly classifies Case 3's timing issues and no Follow-up as non-normative.
- Provides reasonable, on-topic interpretations (e.g., weekends for delays).
- Concise conclusion tying back to flagging only Case 2.

**Fatal Flaws (major deductions for inaccuracies and logical gaps):**
1. **Misses critical normative violation in Case 2 (Part 1)**: No mention of the **complete absence of "Inform Applicant"**, which is a *strictly required step* after Loan Decision ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; sequence: Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  ...). Log shows LD at 09:30  Finalize 10:00  Close 10:30, skipping Inform entirely. This is a clear sequence skip, independent of approve/reject. Not listing/explaining it makes the analysis incomplete and inaccurate—Case 2 has *at least four* violations, not three. (-2.0 points)
2. **Mishandles desiderata identification (Part 2)**: Fails to identify Case 3's timing delays (>24h for Credit Check, >48h for Inform Applicant) as desiderata failures, explicitly calling them "not violated" and "not even a desideratum violation" despite prompt text ("preferred... within 24 hours", "within 48 hours"; "failing to adhere to these timing recommendations"). Task requires "identify which cases fail to meet the desiderata conditions" and clarify as "suboptimal" (not severe). Table lists *only* Follow-up; ignores timings entirely. Contradicts prompt's equal treatment of timings/Follow-up as desiderata. (-1.5 points)
3. **Logical flaw/unclear table in conclusion**: Violation columns are *blank for all cases*, creating ambiguity (visually implies "no" for everyone). Notes contradict (e.g., Case 2 notes "serious normative violation"). Poor execution undermines readability and precision. (-0.5 points)

**Minor Flaws (further deductions per "hypercritical" instruction):**
- Imprecise wording: Case 2 summary calls it "skipped Credit Check" (it was performed, just out-of-order after Risk Assessment). (-0.3)
- Redundant/overlaps in Case 2 normative table: "Close Case after finalizing" is derivative of "Finalize after rejection" (rules prohibit finalize on reject, implying direct close). Not wrong, but inflates without adding value. (-0.2)
- Desiderata table note downplays all issues excessively ("minor deviation, not a violation"), partially undermining task's "suboptimal behavior" clarification by treating desiderata as non-violations. (-0.3)
- No explicit Case 2 desiderata analysis (timings were met-ish, but irrelevant due to normative fails; still, incomplete coverage). (-0.2)

**Total Rationale**: Starts at ~9.0 for structure/coverage of *most* issues, but major misses (Inform skip, desiderata timings) drop to 6.0. Not "nearly flawless"—core analysis omits obvious log facts and misreads desiderata scope. A 10.0 requires zero gaps; this has several preventing full credit.
