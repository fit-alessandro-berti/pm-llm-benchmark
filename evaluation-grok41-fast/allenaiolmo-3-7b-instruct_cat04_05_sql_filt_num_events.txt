**8.0**

### Evaluation Summary
- **Strengths (leading to 8.0 base)**: The primary CTE-based query is **flawless**—correctly computes event counts per `case_id`, filters `<= 6` accurately via JOIN + WHERE, and returns *all* events (`e.*`) only from qualifying cases. It handles the requirement precisely, is efficient in DuckDB, and preserves all columns. Structure with CTE is clear and matches the explanation's intent.
- **Minor deductions (-0.5 total)**:
  - Explanation point 2 inaccurately states "where the event count is 6" (missing "<= "), contradicting "6 or fewer" in the header and prompt; actual query is correct, but text is imprecise.
  - References "`CROSS JOIN LATERAL`" and "`HAVING`" in intro but uses neither (uses INNER JOIN + WHERE); superficial but unclear.
- **Major deduction (-1.5 total)**: The "alternative" query is **logically broken**:
  - `WHERE t.rn <= 6 AND t.total_events = t.rn` returns *only the last event* (where `rn == total_events`) per qualifying case, not "the full set of events." For a case with 5 events, only `rn=5` passes; others fail `total_events = rn`.
  - Unnecessarily adds `rn`/`total_events` columns (SELECT * includes them, bloating output).
  - Assumes `ORDER BY timestamp` for `ROW_NUMBER()` (works but arbitrary/unneeded; prompt doesn't require ordering).
  - Labeled as "more concise approach" despite being verbose, less efficient (full window scan), and incorrect—misleads users.
- **Other notes**: Extra politeness/fluff ("Certainly!", "Let me know...") is harmless. No syntax errors, DuckDB-compatible. Overall strong but not "nearly flawless" due to flawed alternative and textual slips; strict rubric demands perfection for 9+.
