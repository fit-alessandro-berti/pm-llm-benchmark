**2.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation:
- **Fatal Logical Flaw #1 (Deadlock in Document Verification Path, Score Killer):** Transition `t_dv` has **two input places** (`claim_registered` and `documents_submitted`). Standard Petri net firing rule requires **all** input places to have sufficient tokens (AND semantics, not OR). Initially: token reaches `claim_registered=1` after `t_cr`, but `documents_submitted=0`, so `t_dv` cannot fire. **Entire net deadlocks after first transition.** No path to `fm`. Invalid accepting Petri net.
  
- **Fatal Logical Flaw #2 (Deadlock in Fraud Check Loop):** Transition `t_fc` has **two input places** (`documents_verified` and `investigation_done`). Even if DV path worked, after `t_fc`  `fraud_checked`  `t_ii`  `investigation_done=1`, `t_fc` cannot refire because `documents_verified=0`. **Loops impossible; deadlocks.** Directly contradicts "multiple times" requirement.

- **Inaccuracy #1 (Missing Conditional Approval):** Scenario explicitly states AP is **conditional** ("if the amount surpasses a certain threshold"). Net forces linear `claim_assessed`  `t_ap`  `approved`  `t_p` (no bypass/split/merge). Fails to model optional AP  direct to P for low amounts. Logical incompleteness.

- **Inaccuracy #2 (Inconsistent State Modeling):** `documents_submitted` only for RDS loop, but initial DV skips it (`claim_registered`  `t_dv` directly). Creates asymmetric paths; reinforces deadlock. No unified "ready_for_DV" place. Unclear/unnatural.

- **Minor Flaws (Still Deduct Significantly):**
  - No place/transition for initial "Insurance Claim (C)" filing (start  CR skips it; "new claim arriving" vague).
  - Transition labels correct (activity names match), but internal names (`t_cr`) unnecessary/unused.
  - Loops "modeled" but non-functional due to deadlocks.
  - No concurrency/inhibitors for choices (fine for basic net, but nondeterministic OR not explicit).
  - Code syntax valid (imports, adds, arcs correct), im/fm correct, but net unusable for simulation/conformance.

- **Positives (Minimal Credit):** Syntax error-free; attempts all activities/loops; sequential end correct (P  N  CL); summary accurate in intent (but not execution).

**Overall:** Non-functional net (no firing sequence im  fm); core scenario (loops, conditional AP) broken/missing. Not "accepting." Equivalent to pseudocode with bugs. 2.0 for structure/effort; 1.0 too harsh for runnable code. Far from flawless.
