7.2

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (supporting ~8/10 baseline):**
- **Structure and Completeness**: Perfectly mirrors the task's 1-2-3 structure. Anomalies identified accurately and concisely (loop, XOR skip, premature C via A->C edge). Hypotheses are plausible and tied to each anomaly (business/regulatory/technical angles). Queries directly target anomaly verification with executable SQL.
- **Anomaly ID**: Spot-on; captures loop multiplicity, optional N, and loose ordering precisely from POWL code.
- **Hypotheses**: Reasonable and varied; covers business changes, bugs, policies—aligns with task examples without rote copying.
- **Queries Overall**: Functional PostgreSQL syntax; uses correct tables/joins; ordered by relevance (amount/type); HAVING/GROUP BY apt for aggregates. Extra analysis suggestions (distributions, timing, adjusters) show insight.

**Fatal Flaws (deducting -2.8 total; no 9-10 as "nearly flawless" requires zero logical gaps):**
- **No Use of `adjusters` Table (-1.2)**: Task explicitly mandates queries "against the `claims`, `adjusters`, and `claim_events` tables." All three queries ignore `adjusters` entirely despite relevance (e.g., `resource` in `claim_events` likely links to `adjuster_id`; could verify mismatches like non-specialized adjusters causing premature C or loops). End-mention of "adjuster assignments/specializations" is hand-wavy; no query. Major incompleteness.
- **Premature Closure Query Logically Flawed (-0.9)**: `NOT LIKE '%E%P%C%'` detects *absence of any E-P-C subsequence*, not *premature* C (e.g., sequence R-A-C-E-P-C2  'RACEPC' matches `%E%P%C%` via E(4)-P(5)-C(6), unflagged despite early C after A bypassing loop/XOR). Fails to use timestamps for true prematurity (e.g., `WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events c2 WHERE c2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND c2.activity='C' AND c2.timestamp < (SELECT MIN(ce.timestamp) FROM claim_events ce WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity IN ('E','P'))`). Approximate at best, misleading for hypothesis verification.
- **Skipped N Query Incomplete (-0.4)**: Arbitrary `INTERVAL '7 days'` on `submission_date` flags potentially open claims (no check for closure via `activity='C'`). Better: claims *with C but no N* (e.g., `LEFT JOIN ON activity='N' WHERE has_C AND e.claim_id IS NULL`). Risks false positives.
- **Unclarities/Minor Issues (-0.3)**: Meaningless `[1][2][5]` citations everywhere (no refs; sloppy/placeholder artifact). Multiple E/P query ignores loop semantics (#E  #P+1); doesn't correlate with `claim_type`/`amount` for hypotheses. No queries for other anomalies (e.g., A before R, region mismatches via `adjusters`).

**Score Calculation**: 10 - 2.8 = 7.2. Solid effort but flawed execution prevents higher; strictness demands precision in queries for "verify these hypotheses using the underlying database."
