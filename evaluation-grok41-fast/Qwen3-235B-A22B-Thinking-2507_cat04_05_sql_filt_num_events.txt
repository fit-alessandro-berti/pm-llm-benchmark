The provided answer is flawless. The final SQL query is correct, efficient, and precisely matches the requirements: it uses `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to identify valid `case_id`s, then filters the full `event_log` rows via `IN` subquery to return exactly the events from cases with 6 events total. The explanation is clear, accurate, and directly tied to the logic without extraneous details. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or deviations from standard SQL (fully compatible with DuckDB).
