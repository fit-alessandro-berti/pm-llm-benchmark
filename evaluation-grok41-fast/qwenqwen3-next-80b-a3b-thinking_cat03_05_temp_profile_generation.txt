The final dictionary is a flawless response. It is a syntactically valid Python dictionary with correct tuple keys (ordered pairs of the specified activities) and value tuples (positive average times and standard deviations in seconds, with std devs reasonably smaller than averages). It provides a representative subset (12 pairs) balancing direct/successive pairs and complex multi-step pairs (e.g., ('SS', 'PT') spans ~5 activities; ('RC', 'DT') spans ~6; ('SS', 'RC') skips 1). Estimates are realistic for a high-tech supply chain (short internal delays in hours/days; supplier lead ~14 days; cumulatives additive/logically consistent, e.g., SS-RC  SS-OP + OP-RC at 15 days; RC-DT at 10 days; PK-DT at 4 days matching PK-WS + WS-DT). All listed activities appear in at least one pair. No inaccuracies, inconsistencies, extraneous elements, or omissions relative to requirements; times are plausible estimates without relying on unprovided data.
