**5.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Anomalies (Partial Credit, ~6/10)**: Core contradiction (existence of `C` vs. noncoexistence `E`/`C`) correctly identified as a paradox, aligning with model logic (every trace requires `C`, but `E` blocks `C`, implying no `E` allowed ever). However, inaccurately states "both `E` and `C` must exist" (model mandates only `C`; `E` conditional on `A`). Point 2 mischaracterizes `responded_existence` ("E emerges *from* `A`", "neglects temporal sequence")—DECLARE's `responded_existence(A, E)` enforces `if A then E exists after`, not "irreversible" or neglected order; minor but flawed. Point 3 valid but superficial (partial chain undermines flow, true but obvious).
- **Hypotheses (Strong, ~9/10)**: Comprehensive, directly matches prompt examples (misinterpretation, policy changes, data issues, pressure/skipping). Creative additions (e.g., "undocumented rule change") enhance without straying. No flaws.
- **SQL Verification (Poor, ~2/10)**: Critical failures undermine utility:
  | Query | Issues |
  |-------|--------|
  | 1 | Works (finds `E`+`C` co-occurrence, correct for noncoexistence violation). Unnecessary `SUM` on scalar aggregate is sloppy (`HAVING has_evaluation > 0 AND has_closing > 0` cleaner). |
  | 2 | **Invalid SQL** (`claims.claim_id` undefined—no `claims` table; syntax error). Logic wrong (counts `C` > `E` events, not "without `E`"; ignores order despite stated goal). Should be `HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity='C' THEN 1 END) > 0 AND SUM(CASE WHEN activity='E' THEN 1 END) = 0`. |
  | 3 | **Wrong logic** for `responded_existence(A, E)` violation (checks `E` without `A`, but rule violated by `A` without `E`). Ignores timestamps/order ("precede"). Type mismatch likely (`resource` VARCHAR vs. `adjuster_id` INTEGER). |
  | 4 | **Irrelevant** (timings for `N` post-`E`; model has no `N`, no intervals). Syntax issues (subtracts timestamps without CAST; `HAVING` logic incoherent). |
  Overall: Only 1/4 functional/relevant; fails prompt examples (e.g., "closed without evaluation", "evaluation and closing coexist"—half-misses).

**Composite**: Strong hypotheses buoy score, but SQL flaws (core task) are severe inaccuracies/logical errors per strict criteria. No near-flawless execution.
