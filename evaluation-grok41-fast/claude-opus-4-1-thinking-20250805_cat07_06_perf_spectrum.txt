This response is exemplary: fully accurate in identifying the Sankey diagram's structure, labels, colors, time axis, flow mechanics (e.g., volume via thickness, progression of cases), and purpose. It provides clear, insightful interpretation without errors, speculation, or omissions—directly mirroring the visualization's elements (top gray "Send Fine" lines, pink middle "Insert Fine Notification" flows, bottom "Send for Credit Collection" sink). Concise yet comprehensive; no improvements needed.
