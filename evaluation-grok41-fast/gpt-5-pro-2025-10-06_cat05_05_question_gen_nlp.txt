The provided answer is exemplary and fully compliant with the prompt. It delivers exactly 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions ("How" and "What" structures ensure openness), all tightly derived from and expanding insightfully on the described process (e.g., multinational sourcing from named countries, Malaysian assembly, global distribution/logistics, quality/compliance, digital analytics, risks like recalls/customs, improvements like JIT/inventory/forecasting). No SQL queries, no extraneous text—just a clean numbered list. Questions hyper-focus on insights (e.g., visibility, traceability), issues (e.g., risks, disruptions), strategies (e.g., optimization, mitigation), and implications (e.g., ROI, lifecycle impacts). Jargon (e.g., S&OP, OEE, FTZs) is precise, standard for this domain, and logically inferred without inaccuracies or overreach. No unclarities, flaws, or deviations; it is flawless.
