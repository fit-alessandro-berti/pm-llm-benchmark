**10.0**

The provided SQL query is correct, efficient, and precisely matches the requirements. It accurately identifies `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via a subquery with proper `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then returns all columns (`SELECT *`) for events in those cases using `IN`. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, inefficiencies, or deviations from standard SQL (compatible with DuckDB). It handles the full event set per qualifying case without extraneous filtering or assumptions. Flawless execution.
