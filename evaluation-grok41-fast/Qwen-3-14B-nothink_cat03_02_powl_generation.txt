4.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (why not <4.0)**: 
  - Correct imports and class usage (StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition).
  - All labels accurately match scenario (e.g., "Service Request (SR)", "Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)").
  - Loop correctly modeled as `OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [BNC, D_R])`, matching exact semantics: BNC then optional (D&R + BNC repeat).
  - XOR correctly as `OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, [CD, MD])` (exclusive, no skip needed).
  - Core flow up to XOR perfect: SR  CS  {DA || ACI}  loop  XOR, with precise edges (CSDA/ACI, DA/ACIloop, loopXOR). Concurrent DA/ACI handled correctly (no edge between them).
  - `po_QA_SA` correctly created as `StrictPartialOrder([QA, SA])` with no internal edges (correct for concurrency/any order).
  - Structure intent and summary diagram match scenario perfectly.

- **Critical Flaws (major deductions, preventing higher score)**:
  - **Invalid edges crash the code**: `root.order.add_edge(xor_CD_MD, QA)`, `xor_CD_MD  SA`, `QA  GLA`, `SA  GLA`. QA/SA are **not** in `root.nodes` (only `po_QA_SA` is); these will raise errors (e.g., KeyError/NodeNotFound). Cannot link to nested internals from parent PO. Fatal runtime/logical inaccuracy.
  - **Missing essential edges (wrong semantics)**: No `xor_CD_MD  po_QA_SA`, so `po_QA_SA` (QA/SA) has **no predecessors**—can execute concurrently from start (e.g., parallel to SR/CS), violating "once deployment completed" and "after network configured".
  - **`po_QA_SA  GLA` insufficient/incomplete**: Even the "optional" edge doesn't enforce XOR precedence. PO completion requires *all* nodes done respecting orders, but without incoming edge to `po_QA_SA`, timing wrong. QA/SA/GLA block fundamentally broken.
  - **Unnecessary/misleading sub-PO**: QA/SA could be flattened into `root.nodes` (simpler, still concurrent via no edge), making their edges valid. Nesting shows misunderstanding of cross-level ordering. Scenario doesn't require sub-PO (just "partial order" meaning concurrency + both before GLA).
  - **Logical inconsistency**: Code comments/summary describe correct intent (XOR  {QA || SA}  GLA), but implementation fails to deliver. "Explicitly link po_QA_SA" comment reveals confusion.

- **Minor Flaws (further deductions)**:
  - Redundant "optional" edge doesn't fix issues; adds confusion.
  - No validation/testing implied (code un-runnable).
  - No handling of silent transitions (correct, but example in prompt uses them—minor nit).
  - `root.nodes` list unnecessarily mixes granular (DA/ACI) and composite (loop/XOR/po) nodes inconsistently.

**Overall**: ~70% flawless (pre-XOR perfect, operators perfect), but QA/SA/GLA (20% of scenario) is catastrophically wrong (unrunnable, semantically invalid). Not "faithful" representation—model doesn't enforce described dependencies. Hypercritical: multiple logical flaws + runtime errors = mid-low score. Flawless would be 9-10 (e.g., flatten QA/SA or correctly nest with `xor  po_QA_SA  GLA`).
