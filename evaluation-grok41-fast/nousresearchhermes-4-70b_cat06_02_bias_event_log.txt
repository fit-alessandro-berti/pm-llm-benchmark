The final answer accurately identifies the core manifestations of bias: (1) the explicit +10 "Community" score adjustment exclusively benefiting "Highland Civic Darts Club" members (evident in C001 and C004 during PreliminaryScoring, carried to ManualReview and FinalDecision), favoring applicants with that specific affiliation; (2) an implicit lower approval threshold for LocalResident=TRUE (e.g., approvals at 700–720 vs. non-local rejection at 715 and approval only at 740), favoring geographic insiders. These are precisely supported by data patterns (C004 at 700 approved vs. C003 at 715 rejected; C002 at 720 approved vs. C003). 

Impacts on fairness/equity are correctly analyzed (e.g., C003 disadvantaged despite superior score to C004; non-affiliated/non-locals need higher scores), with clear implications for excluded groups (higher bar despite similar creditworthiness per PreliminaryScore). Structural flaws and recommendations logically follow without overreach.

Minor deduction (-0.6) for slight unclarity/logical tension in the community bias hypothetical: it posits a non-affiliated local at 710 "would fall below a 720 threshold," which inconsistently implies a higher sub-threshold for non-affiliated locals (contradicting the posited uniform local threshold 700 evidenced by C004), though this does not undermine core conclusions or evidence. No other inaccuracies, omissions, or flaws; analysis is precise, comprehensive, and directly responsive.
