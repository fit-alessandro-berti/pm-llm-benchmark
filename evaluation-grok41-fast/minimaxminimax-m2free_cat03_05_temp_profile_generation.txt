The response is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It delivers precisely the required Python dictionary with realistic, domain-appropriate estimates in seconds (e.g., short intervals for sequential steps like RCQI at ~4 hours; longer for distant pairs like SSAS at ~63 days, with stdevs plausibly ~20-50% of avgs reflecting supply chain variability). All 45 forward pairs under the logical linear order (SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS) are included, exceeding the "representative subset" requirement while ensuring complexity via multi-step pairs. Values are floats (appropriate for stats), strictly positive, and temporally monotonic (later pairs have strictly increasing avgs within each starting-activity group). Minor additive discrepancies (e.g., SSQI at 990ks vs. SSRC + RCQI 965ks; ~2.6% variance) are negligible for estimates absent real logs, attributable to trace variability rather than error. Format is clean (code block, explanatory comments without extraneous prose/numbers), keys are correctly ordered tuples, and no invalid pairs/backflows. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws; fully aligns with prompt specs.
