**9.2**

### Strengths (why not lower):
- **Queries are 100% correct and efficient**: Both solutions precisely meet the requirements. The CTE+JOIN uses standard ANSI SQL (fully DuckDB-compatible), correctly groups by `case_id`, filters with `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`, and returns all original columns via `e.*`. The window function variant is equally valid, concise, and avoids self-joins while preserving all rows for qualifying cases. No logical flaws, no incorrect assumptions about schema (uses given columns), no performance issues.
- **Comprehensive**: Provides two idiomatic approaches, covering GROUP BY/HAVING and window functions—better than a single query.
- **Clear structure**: Code blocks, inline comments, optional ORDER BY (tidy and logical), and step-by-step explanation align perfectly with the task.
- **DuckDB-specific adherence**: Uses features like `USING` and window functions optimally; no vendor lock-in issues.

### Deductions (hypercritical flaws, preventing 10.0):
- **Textual inaccuracies/unclarities (minor but repeated, -0.5 total)**:
  - Intro: "case with  6 events" (double space; omits "or fewer"—misstates the condition despite correct `<= 6`).
  - First query comment: "keep only cases with  6 events" (same omission and spacing; inaccurate wording).
  - Explanation step 2: "that count  6" (incomplete/mangled phrasing, likely typo for "<= 6"; creates minor unclarity).
- **Unnecessary but harmless additions (-0.2)**: Optional ORDER BY not required by prompt (though useful); providing two queries exceeds "craft a ... query" (singular) but adds value without error.
- **Nitpicks (-0.1)**: Second ORDER BY uses unqualified `case_id, timestamp` (works since subquery aliases preserve them, but explicit `t.` would be pedantically safer).

Nearly flawless technically—queries execute perfectly on the described schema—but textual sloppiness (3 instances) justifies docking ~0.8 under utmost strictness. A 10.0 demands zero ambiguities, even cosmetic.
