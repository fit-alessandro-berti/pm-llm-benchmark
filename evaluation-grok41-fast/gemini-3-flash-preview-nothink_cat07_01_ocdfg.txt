**9.7**

### Grading Rationale
- **Accuracy (9.9/10):** Near-perfect match to the diagram. Correctly identifies all major nodes (e.g., "Approve Requisition" as hub, "Create Order" at 8.5M volume), colors, volumes (e.g., 5.0M PO, 3.5M SO), timings (100-800ms), and ~90% of flows. Minor issues: Vendor Invoice/Return Order paths slightly oversimplify (e.g., skips "Approve Payment" explicitly between "Process Return" and "Create Invoice"; Return Order doesn't clearly merge into "Close Order," which is Sales Order-exclusive).
- **Comprehensiveness (10/10):** Covers structure, legend, detailed flows, and key insights (e.g., bottlenecks, volumes, purpose). No omissions of visible elements.
- **Clarity & Structure (10/10):** Well-organized with sections, bullet points, and precise language. Easy to follow, professional tone.
- **Insightfulness (9.5/10):** Strong analysis (e.g., interconnectivity, volumes, timings, business purpose in ERP/process mining). Could add minor extras like total throughput or efficiency metrics for perfection.
- **Overall:** Exceptional response—detailed, visual-aid friendly, and actionable for analysts. Deduction only for tiny flow simplifications.
