**9.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Hypercritical Assessment):
- **Correctness and Functionality (9.5/10)**: Both queries logically achieve the goal perfectly—filtering cases to those with 6 events and returning their events. The CTE+JOIN (first query) is flawless: correctly groups, filters via HAVING, joins back for all original columns (`el.*`), excludes >6-event cases entirely. The window function (second) also works correctly in DuckDB (standard SQL), partitioning accurately and filtering post-computation. No data loss or inclusion errors. Handles "at least" columns fine; preserves rows for qualifying cases.
  
- **Completeness and Precision (8.5/10)**: First query returns **exactly** the "full set of events" (original columns only). Second adds an extraneous `events_per_case` column via `SELECT *`, which violates "returns only the events" strictly—it's events **plus** derived data, not "complete event records (all columns)" as claimed in explanation. Minor but clear inaccuracy per hypercritical lens; output schema differs from ideal (original table shape). Deducted significantly for this flaw in an "alternative" presented as equivalent.

- **Efficiency and DuckDB Suitability (10/10)**: Both optimal for DuckDB ( columnar store favors window funcs; CTE materializes efficiently). Window noted as "often more efficient" (true, single pass). No DuckDB-specific issues; standard SQL.

- **Clarity, Structure, and Explanation (9.5/10)**: Well-formatted code blocks. Numbered explanations precise and educational. Ordering by `case_id, timestamp` (unasked but logical/useful for event logs). Headers distinguish approaches. Minor deduct: Explanation glosses over second query's extra column ("complete event records (all columns)" implies originals only—slight unclarity/misstatement).

- **Logical Flaws or Edge Cases (10/10)**: Handles edges (e.g., cases with 0-6 events, ties on timestamp unnecessary). No self-joins, subquery explosions, or GROUP BY errors. HAVING used correctly pre-JOIN.

- **Overall Polish and Adherence (9.0/10)**: Provides **two** solid options (better than "a" query), but second's schema mismatch prevents perfection. No syntax errors, ambiguities, or overcomplication. Nearly flawless, but extra column + explanation imprecision = non-negligible deduct (strictness applied: minor output mismatch = significant penalty).

**Total: 9.2**—Excellent, production-ready, but not "nearly flawless" due to second query's unnecessary column altering the exact output shape expected for "events." A single perfect query (like first alone) would be 10.
