**10.0**

The final process tree precisely captures all observed traces with perfect fitness (reproduces RA  VF  AE  (direct or rework with 1+ consecutive RMI  VF)  AD  SC  AC), high precision (blocks invalid sequences like VF directly after AE without RMI, RMI without terminating VF, or extra activities), and optimal simplicity (minimal operators: sequence, single XOR for optional rework, inner loop only for RMI repetitions; no unnecessary concurrency or overcomplexity). Notation is exact to the prompt (operators, quoting, tau unquoted), semantics align perfectly with loop definition (enables consecutive RMI via * (tau, 'RMI') yielding RMI effectively), and explanation is concise/accurate without code. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws.
