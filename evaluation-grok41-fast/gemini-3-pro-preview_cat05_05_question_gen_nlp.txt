The response is exemplary and fully compliant with the prompt. It delivers exactly 20 distinct, open-ended, thought-provoking questions that directly derive from and probe the described supply chain process, emphasizing insights (e.g., Q12 on ML accuracy), issues (e.g., Q1 geopolitics, Q14 traceability), improvements (e.g., Q20 feedback loops), and implications (e.g., Q5 carbon trade-offs, Q9 currency risks). All questions are phrased as "how," "what," or "to what extent," ensuring openness. No SQL queries or extraneous content beyond a single, concise introductory sentence that frames the list without adding analysis. Bolded subtitles provide precise categorization without altering substance, enhancing clarity without violation. Every question accurately reflects process elements (e.g., specific suppliers/countries in Q1/Q10/Q14, 24/7 Malaysia ops in Q3/Q16, JIT/aggregated in Q4, etc.). No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, logical flaws, or off-topic deviations—structure, relevance, and depth are impeccable.
