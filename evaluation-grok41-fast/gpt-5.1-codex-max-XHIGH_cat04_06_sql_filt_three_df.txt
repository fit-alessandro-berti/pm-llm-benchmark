**10.0**

The provided solution is nearly flawless. It correctly uses window functions (`LEAD`) partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `"timestamp"` to detect the exact sequence in direct succession from the 'Approve Purchase Requisition' event. The time filter `(ts2 - ts1) > INTERVAL '5 days'` precisely targets the gap between 'Create Order' (lead 1 timestamp) and 'Confirm Order' (lead 2 timestamp). The CTE collects `DISTINCT case_id`s matching **both** criteria, and the outer query excludes **all events** from those cases via `NOT IN`, returning the rest ordered logically by `case_id, "timestamp"`. DuckDB syntax is accurate (intervals, quoting, etc.). No logical flaws, edge cases missed (e.g., multiple sequences per case, intervening events break `LEAD` matches), inaccuracies, or unclarities. Explanation reinforces correctness without extraneous content.
