**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This prompt is exceptionally strong overall—clear, structured, accurate, and directly aligned with the core objectives (anomaly identification, hypothesis generation, SQL proposal). It faithfully reproduces the schema, happy path, and data summaries without fabrication or error. The task decomposition (Diagnosis  Hypotheses  SQL) perfectly mirrors the requirements, enforces full-dataset pattern detection (not case-specific), and specifies PostgreSQL syntax. Output format is rigid and helpful. System role adds immersion.

**Strengths (Justifying High Score):**
- **Anomaly Encouragement**: Explicitly tasks analysis of deviant cases vs. happy path, prompting "skipped steps, out-of-order activities, or logical impossibilities" with a neutral example. Data snippets vividly expose deviations (e.g., payment before registration in 1004, shipping pre-credit/confirm in 1002/1003).
- **Hypothesis Depth**: Demands "business or technical" reasons per anomaly, with diverse examples (bypassing controls, retrospective logging, order_type). Ties to data attributes (e.g., priority/high-value).
- **SQL Focus**: Insists on investigative queries for *hypotheses*, generalizes to patterns, mandates joins (resources/orders implied via examples), avoids case_id limits. Examples are illustrative ("if you suspect..."), not solutions—encourages originality.
- **No Spoilers/Over-Guidance**: Data is raw sequences; no explicit anomaly lists. Hypotheses examples are suggestive but open-ended.
- **Fidelity**: Schema/data precise (e.g., 1002 priority noted); encourages full tables.

**Flaws (Strict Deductions, -0.8 Total):**
- **Minor Typo/Unclarity (-0.3)**: Task 1: "Compare them against the "Happy Path" (Case 1001). specific deviations,"—awkward punctuation, missing "Identify" or capitalization. Hypercritical: disrupts flow, could confuse LLM parsing.
- **Slight Over-Guidance in Examples (-0.3)**: SQL "Example requirement" snippets (e.g., "shipping before credit checks", "high-value orders") directly echo data anomalies (1002/1003 shipping pre-credit; 1004 high-value). Violates "without any hints or guidance provided here" spirit—guides hypotheses/SQL toward exact issues, reducing pure discovery. Not egregious (phrased conditionally), but strict: should be more generic (e.g., "sequence violations generally").
- **Edge Imprecision (-0.2)**: Hypothesis example "Maverick Buying" is procurement jargon, loosely fits O2C deviations (better: "maverick processing"). 1004 snippet omits "incompleteness" explicitly (no final payment), but implied—minor missed emphasis for "undesirable behaviors".

**Why Not 10.0?** Not "nearly flawless"—guidance/examples border on hints, typo exists. But deductions minimal; 9.2 reflects elite quality (95%+ perfection). Fixes would yield 10.0.
