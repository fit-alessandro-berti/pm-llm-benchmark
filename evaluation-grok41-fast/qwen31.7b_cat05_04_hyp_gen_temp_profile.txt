**3.5**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Anomalies Identification (Partial Credit, ~7/10)**: Correctly spots RP (low STDEV) and PN (high STDEV) as primary, matching example. Formats clearly. However, omits or downplays example-highlighted AC (quick closure post-assign, potentially skipping steps) and EN (unrealistically rapid), limiting completeness. Minor: Uses "~25 hours" casually without precise 90000s reference.
  
- **Hypotheses (Weak, ~4/10)**: Aligns superficially (automation for short times, backlogs/resources for delays). But RP alternative ("systemic delays... causing large gaps") contradicts the short/rigid anomaly—logical flaw, mismatches prompt examples. PN repetitive ("backlogs" and "inconsistent resources" overlap). Too brief, misses prompt suggestions like "automated steps skipping checks" or "bottlenecks." No coverage for other example anomalies.

- **SQL Queries (Fail, ~1/10)**: Fundamentally broken—**major inaccuracies rendering unusable**:
  | Issue | Details | Impact |
  |-------|---------|--------|
  | **Non-existent columns** | `timestamp_of_P`, `timestamp_of_R`, etc., don't exist. `adjustment_id`  no such column (`resource` is VARCHAR, not ID). | Queries won't parse/run. |
  | **No per-claim logic** | No `GROUP BY claim_id`, CTEs, LAG(), or pivots (e.g., `FIRST_VALUE(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp)`). Scans all rows illogically. | Can't compute per-claim intervals. |
  | **Invalid comparisons** | TIMESTAMP diff yields INTERVAL, not numeric. Can't `< 25*60` directly—needs `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (diff)) < 90000`. Units sloppy: RP as minutes (25*60=1500min=25h, coincidentally ok), PN as hours (5*24=120h=5d, ok) but inconsistent/unreliable. Assumes ±2*STDEV arbitrarily (prompt implies ZETA, unmentioned). |
  | **Incomplete correlations** | Query 4 uses wrong column (`adjustment_id='X'`), no joins to `claims`/`adjusters` for types/regions/customers. Misses prompt: "correlate with adjusters, claim types... customer or region segments." No "claims closed immediately after assignment" or "approval to notification... long." |
  | **Pseudocode masquerading as SQL** | Presented as executable but isn't. No full queries (e.g., how to get timestamps?). Includes extraneous AC despite not flagging as anomaly. |

- **Overall Structure/Independence (Good, ~8/10)**: Clean, markdown-formatted, no meta-references to instructions. Self-contained.

**Why not higher?** SQL is ~1/3 of prompt, core to "verification methods using SQL queries"—catastrophic flaws (won't execute, illogical) outweigh decent anomalies/hypotheses. Logical mismatches + incompleteness = not "nearly flawless." Strict penalty for "any inaccuracies... logical flaws." Equivalent to a student submitting broken code for a coding-heavy task.
