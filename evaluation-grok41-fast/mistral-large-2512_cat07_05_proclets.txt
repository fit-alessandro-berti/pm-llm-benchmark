**8.2**

### Breakdown
- **Part (a) Process Diagram (6.5/10)**: Good overall structure identifying the two protocol classes (Lab Visit, Lab Test), key actions (e.g., order entry, blood sample, receive result, judge, send report, perform test, chemical analysis), and channels. However, inaccuracies include misinterpreting the decision diamond ("Everything fine?" likely branches to "Do test again" on no/else and proceed on yes; answer flips this as "need to be fine-tuned (Everything fine)"). Minor issues: "lab appointment" not in diagram; order system slightly oversimplified; some flows (e.g., HIS, lab assistant) omitted or vague.
- **Part (b) Class Diagram (9.5/10)**: Accurate description of classes (Lab visit, Lab test as events) and relationship (1..* multiplicity matches diagram intent, even if rendered as "1 Lab test").
- **Part (c) Performative Table (9.5/10)**: Excellent match to table details (time, channel as "Order system," sender/receivers, action, content, scope, direction). Strong explanation of message purpose/flow.

**Strengths**: Well-organized, comprehensive coverage of all parts, clear language.  
**Weaknesses**: Process flow has logical errors and minor omissions/misreads.  
This is a strong student-level answer but loses points for precision in dynamic elements.
