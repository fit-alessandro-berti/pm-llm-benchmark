**9.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Correctness (Flawless)**: The SQL query is logically perfect. The CTE accurately computes event counts per `case_id`, `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` correctly filters to cases with 6 events (matching "six or fewer"), and the `INNER JOIN` precisely retrieves all events (`e.*`) for qualifying cases only. No data loss, no extras; handles grouping/filtering exactly as required. Works in DuckDB (standard SQL features).
- **Efficiency/Style (Excellent)**: Concise CTE approach is efficient (single pass for counts, join reuses), readable, uses `USING (case_id)` idiomatically. `SELECT e.*` is appropriate for "full set of events."
- **Completeness (Excellent)**: Explanation clearly maps to steps, confirms intent.
- **Deductions (-1.0 total)**:
  - **Minor inaccuracy in inline comment**: `-- 2. Keep only the cases with  6 events` misleadingly implies *exactly* 6 events (ignores "or fewer"), despite correct `<= 6` code and accurate step-2 explanation. Hypercritical: any textual inaccuracy, even in comments, counts as a flaw.
  - **Nit: Unused `num_events` alias**: Harmless (common/idiomatic), but hypercritical pedantry notes it's vestigial since `HAVING` repeats `COUNT(*)`.
- **Why not 10.0?** Not "nearly flawless"—the comment flaw is an inaccuracy, warranting deduction per "even minor issues... significantly lower score." 9.0 reflects excellence with trivial imperfection. A flawless version would fix the comment to `-- Keep only cases with <= 6 events`.
