**3.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Major logical flaw in fitness (critical inaccuracy, -4.0+ penalty)**: The proposed loop `* (tau, -> ('Request Missing Info (RMI)', 'Validate Form (VF)'))` generates traces like `AE  RMI  VF  AD` (case 1, ok) or `AE  RMI  VF  RMI  VF  AD` (two iterations). However, case 3 shows `AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD`—consecutive `RMI` *without* an intervening `VF`. The model forces a `VF` after *every* `RMI`, making case 3 completely unreplayable (zero fitness for 1/3 traces). This directly violates "capturing these possible repetitions of requesting missing info and re-validation" from the observed log, where repetitions are consecutive `RMI` followed by *one* `VF`.
- **Failure to balance fitness/precision/simplicity**: Poor fitness (can't replay full log); over-precise on non-observed `VF`-interleaved `RMI`; simple structure but wrong behavior. A correct model might use `* (tau, 'RMI')` then conditional `VF`, but this doesn't.
- **Misleading explanation (-1.0 penalty)**: Claims "optional repetition of requesting missing information and re-validation" is captured, ignoring case 3's consecutive `RMI`. Uncritical and false.
- **Minor syntax/pedantic issues (-0.5 cumulative)**: Task requests "just the final structure, no code that needs to be executed"—includes unrequested explanation. `tau` quoted as `'tau'` (prompt uses unquoted `tau`). Indentation aids readability but not specified.
- **Partial credits (+1.5 total)**: Correctly places loop post-`AE`/pre-`AD`, uses `tau` for optionality (fits cases 1-2), captures main sequence (`RA  VF  AE  ...  SC  AC`), uses proper notation/operators.

Nearly flawless would replay *all* traces exactly (10.0); this has a fatal behavioral mismatch, warranting low-mid score despite good intent/structure.
