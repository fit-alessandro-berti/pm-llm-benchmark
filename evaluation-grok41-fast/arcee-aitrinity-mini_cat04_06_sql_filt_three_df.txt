**3.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Major Logical Flaw (Primary Deduction: -5.0+)**: The `sequence_occurrences` CTE **completely omits the filter for the first activity (`er1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'`)**. It identifies *any* consecutive event  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order' (with >5 days between Create and Confirm), not the *specific* required sequence starting with 'Approve Purchase Requisition'. This incorrectly excludes cases that lack the full sequence (e.g., excludes cases with 'Email'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order' delayed >5 days). Fundamentally violates requirement #1. No amount of explanation excuses this omission—the code as written is incorrect.
  
- **Incorrect Output Columns (-1.0)**: Final SELECT uses `FROM event_rank el` with `el.*`, injecting the extraneous `event_seq` column not present in `event_log`. Prompt explicitly requires "all events from `event_log`" (original schema only). Forces consumer to drop the extra column post-query.

- **Missing Ordering (-0.5)**: No `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` (or equivalent) in final query, despite prompt's explicit call for "proper ... ordering". Relies on undefined table order; result may not be "solely ... events from the cases that are not filtered out" in expected sequence.

- **Minor Positives (Partial Credit: +0.5)**: Correctly uses `ROW_NUMBER()` for consecutive detection (`event_seq +1`), proper timestamp diff (`> INTERVAL '5 days'` works in DuckDB), `DISTINCT case_id` for exclusion, and `NOT IN` for whole-case filtering. Structure *almost* matches a correct row-number join approach.

- **Explanation Issues (-0.0 additional, but noted)**: Claims "Specific activities in order" but doesn't reflect code (no Approve filter). Calls result "optimized pass" despite flaws.

**Overall**: Approach shows understanding of consecutiveness/time exclusion (~50% right), but critical inaccuracies make it unreliable/non-compliant. Not "nearly flawless"—fails core sequence identification. Equivalent to a buggy prototype, not production-ready.
