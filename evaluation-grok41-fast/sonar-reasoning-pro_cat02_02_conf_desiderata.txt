**7.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Strict Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: Excellent structure with clear sections, tables, and summary matching the task. Accurately identifies Case 2 normative violations for ordering (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) and post-rejection Finalize Documentation. Correctly deems Case 1 and 3 normative-compliant. Desiderata analysis precise (distinguishes minor/suboptimal, lists delays/no Follow-up for Cases 1/3, N/A for Case 2 reasonably). Provides interpretations/justifications (e.g., error/backlog) aligned with task 3. Clarifies desiderata non-severity. Covers all cases comprehensively.
- **Critical Flaws (major deductions for utmost strictness)**:
  - **Inaccuracy in normative violations (primary deduction)**: Completely misses the explicit skipping of "Inform Applicant" in Case 2, a **mandatory normative step** ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed"; sequence explicitly requires Decision  Inform  [...]). Case 2 log has Decision (09:30)  Finalize (10:00)  Close (10:30) **with no Inform at all**—this is a clear "skipping activities" violation under "What is Not Allowed" and ordering rules. Listed only 2 violations instead of 3; summary table omits it. This is a logical flaw and incompleteness in task 1, not fixed or corrected.
  - **Minor unclarities**: Unexplained citations ([1][3] etc.) appear arbitrary/professional lapse. Case 2 desiderata "N/A (normative failures supersede)" dodges explicit identification despite prompt inform recommendation (never done = fails desiderata, even if tied to normative).
- **Overall**: Nearly strong (structure/content ~85% flawless), but the missed normative violation is a **significant inaccuracy** (core to task 1, hypercritical trigger), warranting substantial deduction per instructions. Not "nearly flawless" (e.g., 9+ requires zero issues). 7.0 balances quality against strict penalties.
