**9.2**

The final answer is strong overall: correctly identifies **Group B's log** as exhibiting bias, accurately ties it to **ScoreAdjustment (+10 Community Boost)** for CommunityGroup members (absent in Group A), highlights **systematic differences** in decisions (e.g., U003 approved at 705 vs. Group A's 710 rejection and 720+ approvals), and notes **LocalResident** as a potential amplifier (with U002 as counterexample handled implicitly). Structure is clear, evidence-based, and concludes with structural inequities disadvantaging Group A (Protected).

**Minor deductions for hypercritical strictness** (total -0.8):
- **Unclarity/inaccuracy ( -0.4)**: "relaxed criteria for **protected** CommunityGroup members" – misleading; Group B is *Unprotected*, and "protected" misapplies to CommunityGroup (Highland Civic Darts Club). Should be "certain" or "CommunityGroup-affiliated."
- **Overstatement ( -0.2)**: LocalResident "amplifies systemic advantages" is speculative (U002 disproves standalone effect); better as "correlates with" or secondary.
- **Minor logical gap ( -0.2)**: Assumes uniform "720 cutoff" from small Group A sample without noting inference limits, though U003's 705 approval starkly evidences disparity.

Flawless on core question elements; issues are phrasing nitpicks, not undermining conclusions.
