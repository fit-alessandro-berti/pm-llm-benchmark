**3.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Major Code Errors (deduct 3+ points)**: AS is defined but **not included in `StrictPartialOrder.nodes`**, yet `add_edge(iqc_loop, AS)` and `add_edge(AS, test_loop)` reference it. This renders the code syntactically invalid and non-executable in pm4py. RT, TST, IQC similarly encapsulated but testing loop misused. No import for `Operator` (used as `Operator.LOOP` but should be `pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.Operator` per prompt example).
- **Incorrect Loop Modeling for IQC/AS (deduct 2+ points)**: `LOOP(AS, IQC)` executes AS  (exit | IQC  AS  ...), but edges `QS  iqc_loop  AS  test_loop` force **extra AS** after loop exit (e.g., case 4: AS  exit  AS  TST = two AS, but log has one; looped cases get 1+ extra AS). Fails to capture case 3's consecutive IQCs (IQC  IQC without AS).
- **Completely Wrong Testing Loop (deduct 2+ points)**: `XOR(RT, TST)` is a **one-time choice** (either RT or TST), not a loop. Log shows TST  (exit | RT  TST  ...), requiring `LOOP(TST, RT)`. Case 1/3/5 (TST  RT  TST  PK) impossible in model.
- **Incomplete/Inaccurate Sequence (deduct 1+ points)**: No edge `optional_lb  DP` wait no, it has it, but chain assumes strict sequence without concurrency (correct per log), yet flawed due to above. Case 4 skips IQC but model mishandles. IQC "loop" placed wrong—log interleaves AS/IQC variably post-QS.
- **Minor/Unclear Issues (deduct 0.8 points)**: Text description mismatches code (e.g., "loop exit from IQC or directly after AS" ignores extra AS). No handling for multiple RT in case 5 (though LOOP would fix). "Skip" for LB correct but generic. No root-level silent/start/end if needed. Overly linear `StrictPartialOrder` ok, but underutilizes POWL (e.g., no nested PO for assembly phase).
- **Strengths (partial credit only)**: Correctly identifies ORMSQS prefix, PKoptional LBDPD suffix, uses `SilentTransition()` for skip, attempts operators. Covers key activities/variability.

**Nearly flawless requires**: Executable code, exact log fidelity (all variants), precise POWL semantics (proper LOOP/XOR nesting/ordering, no extras). This is ~60% conceptual fit but critically broken—unusable model.
