**10.0**

The answer is exemplary: precisely identifies Group B as biased with zero factual errors (e.g., accurate case comparisons, boost mechanics, raw vs. adjusted scores). Analysis of manifestation is comprehensive, logically structured (e.g., step-by-step bias introduction, disparate treatment/impact, hypotheticals grounded in data). Implications and mitigations are insightful, relevant, and actionable without overreach or speculation. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or omissions—even minor formatting quirks (e.g., "60 65") are self-evident in context and do not impede understanding. Fully addresses the question's requirements on bias identification, manifestation, and fairness/equity implications.
