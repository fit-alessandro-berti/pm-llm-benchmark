The provided code is a flawless representation of the described POWL model. It correctly constructs all required `Transition` nodes with exact labels matching the scenario (including "D&R"), builds the `OperatorPOWL` nodes for the loop (`LOOP` with BNC first, then D&R) and exclusive choice (`XOR` with CD and MD), and uses a single root `StrictPartialOrder` to enforce all precise ordering constraints via `.order.add_edge()` calls. These edges perfectly capture:

- Sequential SR  CS.
- CS preceding both DA and ACI (with no edge between DA/ACI for concurrency).
- Both DA and ACI preceding the loop node.
- Loop preceding the XOR node.
- XOR preceding both QA and SA (no edge between QA/SA for concurrency).
- Both QA and SA preceding GLA.

No unnecessary silent transitions, nesting, or deviations; semantics align exactly with POWL definitions (e.g., partial order edges mean "target cannot start before source completes"; operators handle loop exit/choice internally). Imports match requirements; code is executable, commented accurately, and concise without errors, ambiguities, or logical flaws.
