**8.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Assessment):
- **Strengths (accounting for ~80% of score)**:
  - Correct overall structure: Single start place (`p_start`) with `im[p_start]=1`, single end place (`p_closed`) with `fm[p_closed]=1`.
  - Main sequence accurately modeled: C  CR  DV  FC  CA  AP  P  N  CL.
  - Loops correctly implemented with choices:
    - DV loop: `p_after_DV`  RDS  `p_after_CR`  DV (allows multiple RDS  DV cycles; proceeds to FC if no RDS).
    - FC/II loop: `p_after_DV`  FC  `p_after_FC`  II  `p_after_DV` (allows multiple FC  II  FC cycles; proceeds to CA if no II).
  - Proper use of `pm4py` APIs: Places/transitions added via `update()`, arcs via `petri_utils.add_arc_from_to()`, markings as `Marking()` dicts.
  - Code is runnable, well-commented, self-contained, with legend and description matching intent.
  - Nondeterminism at choice points (`p_after_DV`, `p_after_FC`) logically fits "if incomplete/doubts" without guards (acceptable for basic Petri net).
  - Path from `im` to `fm` exists, modeling accepting behavior.

- **Major Flaws (deducting ~1.5 points)**:
  - **Unused place `p_before_FC`**: Defined, named meaningfully ("waiting for Fraud-Check"), added to `net.places`, but **zero arcs to/from it**. This creates an extraneous, isolated place in the net—direct inaccuracy in construction. Violates clean modeling (scenario has no such state); bloats the net unnecessarily. Hypercritical: Equivalent to dead code in a programming task; net is semantically ok but structurally flawed.
  - **AP modeled as mandatory**: Scenario explicitly conditional ("if the amount surpasses a certain threshold"), implying optional skip (e.g., CA  P directly or via silent transition). Code forces linear CA  AP  P (no branch/skip arc). Logical inaccuracy; doesn't fully capture "complex" conditional flow despite task mentioning "logical sequence with possible loops."

- **Minor Flaws (deducting ~0.5 points total)**:
  - Transition labels: `label` set to full names (e.g., "Insurance Claim") instead of scenario's activity labels/abbreviations (e.g., "C", "CR"). Task specifies "transitions labeled with the activity names"; example uses descriptive labels, but inconsistency with legend/scenario abbreviations (C/CR/DV/etc.) is unclear pedantry.
  - RDS loops back to `p_after_CR` (post-CR, pre-DV): Logically ok but semantically odd—re-submission shouldn't conceptually revisit post-registration state; minor naming/granularity issue.
  - No explicit handling of "multiple times" beyond loops (fine, as loops allow it), but no capacities/inhibitors for fraud/docs (not required).
  - Style: Semicolons in some arc lines (un-Pythonic but harmless); `update()` with sets ok but `net.places.add()` iterative possible.

Nearly flawless would require: No unused elements, conditional AP (e.g., fork after CA: AP  P or  P), exact labels. Current is strong (~85% perfect) but flaws prevent 9+. 8.0 reflects excellent effort with fixable but strict-deductible errors.
