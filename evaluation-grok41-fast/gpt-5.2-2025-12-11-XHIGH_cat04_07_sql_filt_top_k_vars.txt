**9.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Assessment)
This query is **excellent overall** and functionally correct, correctly implementing all core requirements: ordered sequence extraction via `string_agg` with `ORDER BY timestamp` (handles per-case ordering perfectly), variant grouping/counting, top-K selection via `ORDER BY case_count DESC LIMIT 10`, case filtering, and returning filtered original events ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp`. It uses efficient CTEs, proper joins, and DuckDB-compatible syntax (e.g., quoted `timestamp`). No logical flaws, data loss, incorrect filtering, or performance killers. Handles edge cases reasonably (e.g., ties in counts, empty cases unlikely).

### Deductions for Minor Issues (Strict Penalty Applied)
Despite near-perfection, minor inaccuracies prevent 10.0:
- **Extra column (`tc.variant`)** (-0.5): Prompt specifies "Return **all events from the original event_log**" (implying `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp` only). Adding `variant` alters the schema, repeats per event unnecessarily, and deviates from "original event log" output. Harmless functionally but inaccurate to spec. Flawless = `SELECT el.*`.
- **Hardcoded K=10** (-0.5): Prompt says "top **K** variants" (general). Query assumes 10 with a comment to replace—practical but not generalizable (e.g., no `?` parameter or `LIMIT K`). Benchmark likely tests specific K; this requires manual edit.

### Why Not Lower?
- No unclarities (clear structure/comments), logical errors, or failures (e.g., ordering correct, aggregates precise, filtering exact—excludes non-top-K cases perfectly).
- Extras like `ORDER BY` (unrequired but enhances usability) and `'->'` separator (consistent/adequate for grouping) are bonuses, not flaws.
- **Nearly flawless** (+9.0 range): Single-digit deductions only for the two minors; zero major issues.

To reach 10.0: `SELECT el.*` (no extra col), parameterize K (e.g., `LIMIT ?`), drop unneeded `ORDER BY` if pedantic.
