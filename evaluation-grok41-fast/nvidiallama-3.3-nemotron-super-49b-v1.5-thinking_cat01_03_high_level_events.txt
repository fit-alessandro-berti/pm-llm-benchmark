The response fully satisfies all instructions with precise, logical groupings that comprehensively cover every low-level event in the sample log across both cases. Rationales are detailed, evidence-based (citing temporal proximity, resources, sequence, and domain logic), and free of contradictions. Names are domain-relevant and descriptive. The output format is exemplary—structured sections with lists/rationales, plus a clean, accurate JSON representation matching the steps exactly. Grouping principles explicitly align with prompt criteria. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, omissions, redundancies, or logical flaws; it flawlessly transforms granular events into coherent, glanceable high-level workflow stages.
