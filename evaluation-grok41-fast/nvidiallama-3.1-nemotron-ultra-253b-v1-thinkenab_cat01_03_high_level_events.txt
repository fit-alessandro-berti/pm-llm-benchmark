The final output is a precise, structured JSON-like representation that fully addresses all instructions without inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. All low-level events are exhaustively grouped into coherent high-level steps with domain-relevant names (e.g., "Material Preparation" exactly matching the prompt example). Rationales are concise, evidence-based (citing sequence, resources, phases), and justify separations (e.g., distinct quality checks at different stages). Grouping criteria are explicitly summarized, confirming consistency across cases. Single-event steps are logically valid as distinct gates/phases. No omissions, redundancies, or deviations from the event log.
