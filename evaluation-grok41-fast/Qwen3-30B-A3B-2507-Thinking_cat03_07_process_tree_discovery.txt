**10.0**

The final process tree structure is accurate, complete, and precisely captures the event log traces:
- Perfect fitness: Replicates Case 1 (RA  VF  AE  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC), Case 2 (RA  VF  AE  AD  SC  AC), and Case 3 (RA  VF  AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC) via the XOR choice and loop semantics (* (RMI, tau) generates 1+ RMIs with silents invisible).
- High precision: Prevents invalid behaviors (e.g., no RMI after AD/SC/AC, no extra VFs in skip path, no VF without preceding loop entry when needed).
- Simplicity: Minimal use of operators (one XOR, one LOOP with tau), no redundancy, balanced hierarchy.
- Notation flawless: Matches problem syntax (->, X, *), full activity labels, proper nesting, tau used correctly as silent leaf.
No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws.
