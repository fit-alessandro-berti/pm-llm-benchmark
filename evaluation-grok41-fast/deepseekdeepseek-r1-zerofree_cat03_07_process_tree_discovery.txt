**3.0**

The final process tree `* ( tau, -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) )` after `'AE'` produces loop traces with zero or more *pairs* `RMI -> VF` (e.g., , `RMI VF`, `RMI VF RMI VF`), due to loop semantics: `tau` (exit option), then optionally `RMI -> VF` and repeat. This perfectly fits cases 1 (one pair) and 2 (), but **fundamentally fails case 3** (`RMI RMI VF` after `'AE'`), as consecutive `RMI` without interleaving `VF` is impossible—fitness is incomplete (cannot replay all log traces). The model misrepresents "repetitions of requesting missing info" by forcing `VF` after *every* `RMI`, contradicting case 3's clustered `RMI`s before a single re-validation `VF`. No correction in the final structure despite think-step awareness of case 3. Minor: `tau` notation unquoted (prompt uses `tau`, leaves use `'X'`). Balances simplicity but sacrifices fitness/accuracy; not nearly flawless.
