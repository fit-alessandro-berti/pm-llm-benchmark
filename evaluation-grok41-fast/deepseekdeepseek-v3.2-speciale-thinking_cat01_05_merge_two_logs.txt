**10.0**

The final answer (post-<think>) is exemplary and fully meets all requirements with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. 

- **Reasoning** is comprehensive, structured, and explicitly addresses matching criteria (semantic + temporal, with justified 5s tolerance for the sole outlier), mappings, unmatched events, primary timestamp choice (Log A's for merged, respecting "primary timeline"), attribute integration, and ordering—directly fulfilling "document your reasoning for how events were matched or left separate, and how conflicts were resolved."
- **Merged Log** is chronologically ordered by the explicitly chosen primary timestamp, enriches with all attributes (B's added to merged/A-only where applicable; empties for missing), preserves both timestamps (ideal for slight diffs), indicates origins implicitly via timestamps + note, uses canonical event_types appropriately, and employs a clear, professional markdown table format.
- No over-merging/under-merging: 4 confident merges (within/near 2s tolerance, plus reasoned Payment), 2 separate (correctly identified). No logical inconsistencies (e.g., Quality Check slots perfectly post-Payment). Tolerance decision is defensible per prompt's flexibility ("attempt to align... where possible," "confidently match") and documented. All data exact, no inventions/extrapolations.
