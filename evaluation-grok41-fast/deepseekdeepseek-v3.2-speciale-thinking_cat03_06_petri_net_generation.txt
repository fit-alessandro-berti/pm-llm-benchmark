**10.0**

The provided code is a flawless implementation of an accepting Petri net for the described scenario. It precisely captures the linear flow (CR  DV  FC  CA  P  N  CL), the optional approval via non-deterministic choice post-CA (AP or silent skip), and the loops (DV  RDS  back to pre-DV; FC  II  back to pre-FC) using dedicated places to prevent cross-enabling of irrelevant transitions. All activity names are exactly matched in transition labels (e.g., "Document Verification", "Re-Document Submission", "In-depth Investigation"). Silent transitions are minimally and correctly used for pure routing (post-DV complete and post-CA skip), which is standard Petri net practice and not prohibited by the prompt. Structure follows pm4py conventions perfectly: correct imports, place/transition creation/addition, arc additions via petri_utils, and precise im/fm definitions. All paths reach fm from im, loops allow multiples, no deadlocks or extraneous elements, descriptive naming enhances clarity without redundancy. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws whatsoever.
