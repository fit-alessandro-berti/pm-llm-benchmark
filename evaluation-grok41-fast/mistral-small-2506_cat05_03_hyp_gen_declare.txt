4.2

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Anomalies Identification (Major Flaws: -4.0 impact)**: Fundamentally inaccurate. Claims `existence` requires "E" (false; it's for "C"). This invalidates the primary "contradiction" described. Real core anomaly (unaddressed): `existence["C"]=1.0` + `noncoexistence["E","C"]` + `responded_existence["E" after "A"]` forbids any "A" (intended step), as "A" forces "E", but "E" forbids required "C". Ignores `init["R"]`. Anomaly 2 ("precedence") is not anomalous (it's correct/logical). Anomaly 3 vaguely ties issues but builds on errors. Undermines "intended flow" partially noted but not sharply.
- **Hypotheses (Minor Strengths: +1.0)**: Generic but directly matches prompt examples (misinterpretation, incremental, technical, expedite). No flaws, but lacks depth tying to specific model errors (e.g., why forbid "A"?).
- **Verification Approaches (Partial Accuracy: +1.2)**: Structure good; 4 queries cover key checks. Query 1 (C w/o E): relevant (tests allowance). Query 2 (E + C): perfect for noncoexistence. Query 4 (C w/o prior R): spot-on for precedence. **Query 3 flawed**: Checks "E w/o prior A" (precedence E after A), but `responded_existence` requires "A  E" (violation: A w/o subsequent E). Wrong logic; misses timestamps properly for sequence. No query for `init["R"]` or `existence["C"]` (e.g., traces w/o "C"). No `adjusters` join (despite schema/prompt).
- **Overall Structure/Clarity (Strength: +1.0)**: Clean sections, independent presentation, no hints leaked. Concise SQL.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Not "nearly flawless" (core model misread is catastrophic for analysis task). Minor unclarities (e.g., assumes format meanings without precision) compound. 10.0 impossible; 4.2 reflects ~40% accuracy on critical analysis despite polish.
