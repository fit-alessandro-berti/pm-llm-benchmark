**5.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies Case 2 as the sole normative violator (Cases 1 and 3 implicitly compliant). Accurately flags the two main violations in Case 2 (order reversal: Risk Assessment before Credit Check; forbidden Finalize Documentation after rejection). Properly distinguishes desiderata deviations for Cases 1 (missing follow-up call) and 3 (timing delays + missing follow-up), clarifies they are "not severe/suboptimal," and provides some interpretations/justifications (e.g., delays due to bottlenecks/external factors). Structure uses tables/summary for clarity. Covers task parts 1-3.
- **Major Flaws (heavy penalty)**:
  - **Missed critical normative violation in Case 2**: Completely overlooks the **skipped "Inform Applicant" step** after Loan Decision (required strictly: "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed"; "no skipping steps"). Log has no such event—direct jump to Finalize Documentation  Close Case. This is explicitly forbidden ("skip steps"). Answer falsely claims "skips no steps" in table and "All cases completed due processes" in summary. Invalidates completeness.
  - **Logical/structural confusion**: Unnecessarily fragments Case 2 into "Subcases 1-3" (invented; Case 2 is one case). Typo "Cases **2** and **2**" implies multiple cases. "Subcase 3" redundantly repeats prior issues without adding value.
- **Minor but Significant Flaws (further penalty)**:
  - **Timestamp inaccuracies**: Case 3 Credit Check described as "10:00 on next day" (false: 2024-01-12 09:00 to 2024-01-14 10:00 = ~49 hours, *two days* later). Inform Applicant "15:00 next day" (from 14th 12:00 to 16th 15:00 = ~51 hours, *two days* later; exceeds 48h desideratum but mislabeled). Undermines precision.
  - **Unclarities/omissions**: No explicit statement that Cases 1/3 *comply* with normative rules (task requires "identify which cases are violating"). Case 1 desiderata only notes follow-up (correct) but ignores perfect timings. Vague "Case 1/3 Discrepancy Explanation" (undefined "discrepancy"). Extra unasked "Recommendations" dilute focus.
  - **Overstatements**: "No Critical Failures" contradicts Case 2's severity; justifications speculative ("program may have...") without tying tightly to constraints.

Overall: Competent core but undermined by incomplete violation analysis (missed skip = sequence integrity failure), factual errors, and sloppiness. Not "nearly flawless"—mid-tier at best under strict criteria.
