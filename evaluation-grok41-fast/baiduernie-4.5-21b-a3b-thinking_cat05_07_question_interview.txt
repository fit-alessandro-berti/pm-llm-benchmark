**9.4**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is **exceptionally strong**—comprehensive, well-structured, and precisely aligned with the prompt's goals (targeted, open-ended questions focused on conceptual deepening in specified areas: missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, exceptions). It covers the process end-to-end without gaps, avoids SQL/tech, and uses categories for superior organization (enhancing usability beyond a flat list). Questions are predominantly single-focus, probing nuances effectively (e.g., weighting in Q3, timelines in Q5-Q7). Closing note reinforces intent perfectly.

**Minor Deductions (strictly applied, preventing 10.0):**
- **Compound sub-parts (0.3 deduction)**: Q1 (3 clauses), Q3 (2), Q4 (2), Q6 (2), Q9 (examples+criteria), Q10 (how+who+discrepancies). These are *mostly* cohesive but technically overload single questions, risking interviewee overload vs. "targeted" purity.
- **Slightly leading/speculative phrasing (0.2 deduction)**: Q3 ("scoring system or ad-hoc?"), Q6 ("standard... or custom?"), Q10 ("e.g., 30-day follow-ups"—unmentioned timing), Q7 ("ready earlier than expected"—hypothetical not in desc). Implants ideas subtly.
- **Assumed examples (0.1 deduction)**: Q9/Q12 use "e.g." for unmentioned specifics (income stability, tenant requests); fine for openness but hypercritically introduces non-text elements.

No inaccuracies, logical flaws, redundancies, or coverage holes (e.g., marketing in Q12, audits in Q10/Q13, comms in Q11, regions in Q14). Far exceeds "good"—nearly flawless under utmost scrutiny.
