**2.0**

The final proposed process tree structure fails to reproduce the observed trace in Case 3 (AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD), producing instead either 1 RMI + VF, or 3+ RMI + VF (due to the LOOP semantics requiring A (potentially 2 RMI if choosing RMI in X) + B + further A). This results in zero fitness for Case 3, violating the core requirement to capture the "possible repetitions of requesting missing info and re-validation" as shown (exactly two RMI followed by VF). The model also duplicates AD nodes unnecessarily across branches, reducing simplicity without semantic benefit. Notation is mostly consistent with the defined operators but embeds the logical flaw. No precision or simplicity balance is achieved; the structure overcomplicates without fidelity.
