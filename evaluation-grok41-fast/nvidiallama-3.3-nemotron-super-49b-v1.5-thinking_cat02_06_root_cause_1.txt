**9.0**

The answer is exceptionally strong overall: perfectly structured to match the three tasks with clear tables, precise total duration calculations (all verified accurate), correct identification of outlier cases (102, 104, 105), detailed per-case breakdowns, insightful pattern recognition (escalations in 102/105 but not 104, consistent overnight gaps), logical explanations of factors (escalation handoffs, resource constraints, end-of-day postponements, prioritization gaps), and actionable, targeted recommendations (SLAs, cross-training, carryover protocols, metrics tracking). It ties everything to cycle time impacts and ends with a concise conclusion.

**Sole deduction (minor but factual inaccuracy warranting strict penalty):** In Case 105 root causes, the post-escalation gap is stated as "**31 hours later**" (Mar1 10:00 to Mar2 14:00), but exact calculation is 28 hours (Mar1 10:00–Mar2 10:00 = 24h; Mar2 10:00–14:00 = 4h). This is a small arithmetic error in a time-critical analysis but does not undermine the broader logic or patterns (e.g., it still correctly flags a major multi-day delay). No other inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, omissions, or extraneous content found.
