**10.0**

The answer is exemplary: comprehensively identifies all anomalies across Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 with precise timestamp references and sequences; correctly deems Case 1001 normal; provides airtight explanations grounded in standard P2P logic (e.g., three-way matching, approval precedence, PO before goods); highlights exact violations (e.g., payment pre-invoice/goods, goods pre-PO, skipped approvals); elucidates business risks (fraud, overpayment, audit failures) with no speculation or overreach; structures output for maximum clarity (sequences, tables, impacts); offers actionable recommendations without fluff. Zero inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws—flawless execution.
