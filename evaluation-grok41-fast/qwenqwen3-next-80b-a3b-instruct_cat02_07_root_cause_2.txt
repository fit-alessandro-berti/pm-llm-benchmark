**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (supporting the score):**
- **Structure and Completeness**: Excellent organization mirroring the task (1. ID cases, 2. Analyze attributes, 3. Explanations + mitigations). Uses tables effectively for clarity. Covers all attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity). Recommendations are practical, actionable, and tied to findings (e.g., SLAs, automation, training).
- **Key Insights Mostly Accurate**: Correctly identifies high complexity + multiple doc requests as primary cause (evident in 2003/2005). Notes sequential delays and post-request gaps. Region correctly deemed indirect. 2005/2003 rightly flagged as worst.
- **Quantitative Rigor**: Lead times tabulated (mostly precise: 2001/2002/2003/2004 correct within rounding). Averages computed. Gaps quantified (e.g., 20h in 2002, 19h in 2005).
- **Proactive/Forward-Looking**: "Pro Tip" quantifies impact (60% reduction). Dashboard rec smart.

**Fatal Flaws (major deductions: -2.8 total):**
1. **Factual Data Errors (Repeated & Systemic: -1.5)**:
   - **2002 Complexity Mislabeled as "High" Multiple Times**: Called "high-complexity" explicitly 3x (Resource A insight, Region notes "2 out of 3", root summary "2/3 of all high"). It's **Medium**. Inflates Lisa's "high-complexity" count from 1 to 2, fabricating evidence for her as secondary cause.
   - **Wrong High-Complexity Counts**: Lisa "handled 2/3 of all high" (false: high cases=2003 Mike, 2005 Lisa  1/2). Recs: "3 high-complexity cases" (false: only 2005). Region B "2 high out of 3" (false: only 2005; 2002=med).
   - **2005 Lead Time Miscalculated (77.1h actual vs. 79.1h)**: ~2.6% error (72h exact to same time +5.08h=77.08h). Propagates to Region B avg (actual ~35.8h? still higher but less so). Minor alone (-0.2), but compounds.
   - These aren't typos—permeate analysis/tables/conclusions, leading to flawed causation (overblames Lisa/Region B).

2. **Logical Flaws & Unclarities (-0.8)**:
   - **Averages Mix Apples/Oranges**: Resource/Region avgs unadjusted for complexity (e.g., Lisa's 35.5h mixes low/med/high; notes it but derives "key insights" from raw). Masks true drivers.
   - **Downplays 2002 Inconsistently**: Calls it "notably longer" then "moderate/reasonable for medium" then outlier, then not primary. 26h (17x low cases) *is* significant—should be "performance issue" per task, not dismissed.
   - **Assumptions Without Evidence**: "Delayed internal processing" in 2005 (ignores implied customer response time post-request). No receipt events in log, so speculative.
   - **Pro Tip Typo**: "from 31" (obvious 31, but unclear/ sloppy).

3. **Minor Issues (cumulative -0.5)**:
   - Incomplete resource coverage (e.g., Finance_Alan in fast 2001/2003 slow—notes "no pattern" but doesn't explore).
   - 2003 requests both same-day by Mike—hints escalation failure, unaddressed.
   - Over-relies on Lisa/Bill despite Mike/Bill also slow on 2003.
   - No sensitivity (e.g., what if Region B volume bias?).

**Why Not Lower?** Core thesis (complexity  requests  delays) flawless + data-driven. Structure elevates it above mediocre. Not criminal negligence, but not "nearly flawless" (requires 9.5+). Errors undermine credibility—strictly, a data analyst would fail QA on these. 7.2 reflects "strong but critically flawed."
