**9.4**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Completeness (Perfect: +2.5/2.5)**: All low-level events across both cases are exhaustively grouped with zero misses, overlaps, or orphans. Sequence preserved perfectly (e.g., timestamps implicitly respected via logical/temporal rationale).
- **Logical Groupings (Near-Flawless: +2.4/2.5)**: Coherent stages: Prep (setup/positioning/thermal), Assembly (tool-to-measure weld cycle), Coating/Drying (apply-dry pair), QI (final visual). Justifications align with prompt criteria (temporal proximity, resource types, logical flow). Measure weld correctly inline with assembly (not shoehorned into QI); Coating/Drying as distinct finishing phase is domain-appropriate. No arbitrary splits/combines.
- **Rationales (Strong but Minor Flaw: +2.3/2.5)**: Clear, specific explanations per group (e.g., "tightly coupled" for weld-measure). Ties to resources/timing/logic well. **Deduction (-0.2)**: Factual inaccuracy in Coating/Drying rationale ("Heating Unit #1" vs. actual #2 in log—preheat was #1, irrelevant here). Minor but verifiable error undermines precision.
- **Naming (Flawless: +1.0/1.0)**: Domain-relevant, concise, intuitive (e.g., "Coating & Drying" aptly combines sequential pair).
- **Structure/Output (Excellent: +1.2/1.5)**: Detailed sections + table + summary exceed prompt's "structured representation." Table is crisp, scannable. **Minor deduction (-0.3)**: QI lists "Additional quality checks (if any)"—unnecessary hedge; log has *only* visual check (measure weld is elsewhere). Introduces slight unclarity/logical fluff.
- **Overall Fidelity to Goal (+0.0)**: Simplifies workflow elegantly; inferential rules from sample scalable to full log.

**Total: 9.4**. Nearly flawless (strongest possible under strictness); tiny inaccuracies prevent 10.0. No major flaws, no logical gaps, no unclarities beyond nitpicks.
