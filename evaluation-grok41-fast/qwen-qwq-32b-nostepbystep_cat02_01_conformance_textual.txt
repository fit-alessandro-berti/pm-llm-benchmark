The answer correctly identifies the violating cases (2, 3, and 5) and valid cases (1 and 4), with conclusions and summary sections that accurately reference the normative constraints (e.g., order dependencies, no fulfillment after cancel, mandatory steps). Explanations interpret the description well (e.g., Cancel implies insufficient inventory, so no Authorize; missing Package breaks sequence), resolving ambiguities logically. Minor deductions for phrasing issues in Case 3 details (misstated Authorize position in one bullet despite correct sequence listing and later clarification; awkward "missing" Close phrasing despite noting its presence)—these are inaccuracies but do not alter conclusions or miss violations. Overall nearly flawless under strict scrutiny, as core task fulfillment is precise.
