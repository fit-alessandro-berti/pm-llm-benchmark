**9.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Correctness (excellent, but not perfect)**: The query logically achieves the goal perfectly—subquery correctly identifies `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, main query filters via `IN` to return events only from valid cases. No errors in grouping, aggregation, or filtering. Handles the requirement precisely without data loss for valid cases.
- **Completeness**: Selects the exact columns mentioned in the prompt (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`), which represent the core event data. However, strictly, "full set of events" from a table with "*at least* these columns" implies `SELECT *` to preserve any additional columns (e.g., if `event_log` had `user_id` or `status`). This is a minor but clear logical gap—events aren't *fully* returned. Deduct 0.5.
- **Efficiency/Idiom**: Standard, efficient approach for DuckDB (no unnecessary scans; subquery optimizes well). `HAVING` usage is precisely correct vs. `WHERE`.
- **Clarity/Explanation**: Crystal-clear code formatting, step-by-step breakdown, and rationale (e.g., why `HAVING`). Explains optional `ORDER BY` honestly.
- **Unnecessary Additions**: `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` is logical for event logs but **unrequired** by the prompt (no mention of sorting). Adds unrequested performance overhead (minor in DuckDB, but hypercritically, deviates from minimal exact match). Explanation admits "optional," mitigating slightly, but still extraneous. Deduct 0.3.
- **No Other Flaws**: No syntax errors, ambiguities, edge cases missed (e.g., empty table/cases fine), or DuckDB-specific oversights. Explanation has zero inaccuracies.

Nearly flawless (flawless would be `SELECT *` sans `ORDER BY`, or noting column assumption). Strict deduction for the two minor-but-specified issues prevents 10.0.
