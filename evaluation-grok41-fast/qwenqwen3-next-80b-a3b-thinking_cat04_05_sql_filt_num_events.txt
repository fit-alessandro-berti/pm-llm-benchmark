**10.0**

The provided SQL query is correct, efficient, and precisely matches the requirements. It uses a subquery with `GROUP BY case_id` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to identify qualifying `case_id`s, then filters the full `event_log` table via `IN` to return all events from those cases only. This accurately excludes cases with >6 events while preserving all columns and rows for valid cases. No syntax errors, logical flaws, ambiguities, or deviations from standard DuckDB SQL. Fully flawless.
