**2.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Summary
This answer fails catastrophically on accuracy, logical consistency, and fidelity to the scenario and constraint definitions, warranting a minimal score. Major flaws include:

- **Always_before constraints are entirely inverted**: Definition requires pair `(A, B)` to mean "if A occurs, B occurred *before* A" (B always precedes A). All 8 pairs (e.g., `('CA', 'RI')`) are backwards per comments and scenario (CA *before* RI requires `('RI', 'CA')`). This breaks the entire chain (ROCARIPIQCPOGSLDICRP). Fatal error.
  
- **Equivalence misused**: `('RO', 'IC')` implies identical occurrence counts (they always co-occur equally), but scenario has RO always first, IC much later post-Dispatch. Explanation falsely claims "same point in process." No scenario support; pure invention.

- **Always_after errors**: `('RP', 'D')` implies "if RP occurs, D after RP," but scenario has DICRP (payment *after* dispatch). Comment "Record payment before dispatch" contradicts scenario and constraint. Other pairs ok but tainted.

- **Never_together illogical**: `('RP', 'IC')` forbids *any* co-occurrence in a case, but scenario mandates IC always, RP optionally after (both in same case). Comment confuses "same time" (undefined here) with "same case." Wrong constraint type.

- **Directly_follows under-specified/incomplete**: Only 2 pairs despite linear flow (e.g., missing PIQC, QCPO, etc.). Arbitrary; ignores "directly" for rest.

- **Activ_freq minor but acceptable**: Reasonable (all {1} except RP {0,1}), covers all activities. Single positive.

- **Explanation riddled with errors**: Reinforces inversions (e.g., always_before "must occur" order mismatches pairs); equivalence falsehood; never_together timing confusion; claims "accurately represents" despite contradictions.

- **Minor issues compounding deduction**: Unnecessary `print`; equivalence set has trailing comma (valid but sloppy); no constraints for RO start or end (e.g., RO always first via always_before/after); ignores scenario complexity (e.g., no branching for RP).

No redemption—core model is broken, misrepresents process. Equivalent to wrong answers on key mechanics. Only bare structure prevents 1.0.
