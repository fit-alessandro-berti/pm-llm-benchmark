**8.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (supporting high base score):**
- **Complete coverage**: All events from all tables are included for every `order_id` (1001-1005). No missing events (e.g., partial case for 1004 correctly handled with only supported data; multiples for 1002 handled as separate events).
- **Correct data integration/linking**: Perfect use of foreign keys (e.g., payments  invoices  orders; deliveries/picks/invoices per order_id). All timestamps, attributes, notes, quantities, amounts accurately pulled and assigned.
- **Activity derivation**: Logical and matches prompt examples ("Order Created", "Item Picked" *per item* for granularity, "Order Dispatched"/"Order Arrived" *per delivery*, "Invoice Issued"/"Payment Received" *per instance*). No inappropriate summarization or inventions.
- **Enrichment**: Exemplary—resolved all resource_ids to names/roles from Resources table (sales, pickers, carriers, billing). Added useful "Role" column and "Additional Attributes" (priority, customer_type, item details, notes, amounts, refs). Products table unused but optional.
- **Chronological timestamps**: All individual timestamps 100% accurate and reflect real flow (e.g., picks before dispatches where possible; invoices after arrivals).
- **Output format**: Clean Markdown table. Notes document assumptions/decisions well (e.g., multiples, missing data).
- **Process mining readiness**: Granular (per-item/per-delivery/per-invoice/payment), traceable, sortable by case/timestamp.

**Flaws (strict deductions totaling -2.0):**
- **Major: Non-chronological row ordering within cases (-1.5)**: Claimed "Events are sorted by timestamp" and "ordered chronologically," but 1002 block is disordered (11 events, ~4 misordered rows): disp2 (01-05) after arr1 (01-07); inv2 (01-10) *after* pay1 (01-12), despite inv2 preceding pay1; pay1 before inv2/pay2. Violates "placed in sequence," "chronological correctness," "reflect the actual sequence." Visual/logical flaw hinders manual tracing; undermines process flow clarity. Other cases perfect, but one bad case = systemic sloppiness.
- **Minor: Inconsistent/invented payment resources (-0.3)**: "Credit Card System"/"Wire Transfer System"/etc. reasonable (system entity), but ad-hoc naming (3 variants for CC across cases) + uniform "System" role feels arbitrary. Tables lack payment actors; better blank or uniform "Payment System"/payment_method.
- **Minor: No explicit assumptions doc for inventions (-0.2)**: Payment resources/roles inferred but not noted (e.g., "Assumed system-based actors for payments lacking explicit resources").

**Overall**: Nearly flawless (complete, accurate, enriched) but presentation inaccuracy (ordering claim + execution) prevents 9-10. Hypercritical: sequence is core to event logs/process mining; flaw is "significant" per criteria. Equivalent to 85-90% perfection  8.0.
