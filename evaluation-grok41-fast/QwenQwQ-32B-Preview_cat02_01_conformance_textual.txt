**10.0**

The final conclusion correctly identifies Cases 2, 3, and 5 as the violating cases with no inaccuracies. The preceding explanations (not penalized per instructions) precisely reference the normative description's constraints—e.g., Authorize before Package (Case 2), no Ship after Cancel (Case 3), Package required before Ship (Case 5)—resolving ambiguities logically (e.g., Authorize implies sufficient inventory, sequences are mandatory). Cases 1 and 4 are correctly cleared. No logical flaws, unclarities, or omissions; analysis is comprehensive and strictly adherent.
