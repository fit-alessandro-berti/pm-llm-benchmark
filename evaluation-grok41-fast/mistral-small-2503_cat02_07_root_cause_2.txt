**9.7**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
This answer is exceptionally strong—structured perfectly around the three tasks, with accurate calculations, clear attribute correlations, and relevant explanations/mitigations. It directly addresses the prompt's focus on lead times, attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity), and root causes like multiple document requests. Minor deductions only for:
- **Lack of quantitative threshold** (-0.1): "Significantly longer" is visual/qualitative (e.g., no mean/median comparison like low ~1.5h vs. others >25h, or percentiles); assumes reader agreement without stats, minor unclarity in small dataset.
- **Slight overgeneralization in resource analysis** (-0.1): Correctly notes patterns (e.g., Lisa/Bill in long cases), but hedges ("could be due to") without quantifying involvement (e.g., Lisa in 3/3 B-region cases, 2 long; Mike slower only on high). Doesn't flawlessly isolate resource vs. confounding complexity.
- **Medium complexity (2002) attribution** (-0.1): Ties to complexity/region well, but 2002 has only *1* doc request (vs. 2-3 for high), with delays more from overnight waits post-request; slightly blurs causality without event-level timing breakdown (e.g., 4.25h evaluate-to-request, 20h request-to-approve).
- **Mitigations slightly generic** (-0.05): Practical and tied to causes (e.g., dedicated high-complexity team), but lacks specificity (e.g., "cross-train Region B adjusters on doc requests" or "cap requests at 2 with escalation").

No factual errors (durations precisely correct, even informal format consistent), no logical flaws (strong correlations: high complexity  multiple requests  delays), fully comprehensive/clear. Flawless on 95%+; these nits prevent 10.0 under hyper-strict criteria.
