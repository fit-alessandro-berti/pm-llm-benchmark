**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**:
  - **Adherence to Prompt Core Requirements**: 100% open-ended questions. Perfectly targets missing details (e.g., specific docs in Q2.1, red flags in Q8.2), decision criteria (e.g., metrics in Q4.1, negotiations in Q8.2), roles/responsibilities (e.g., stakeholders in Q7.1, compliance officer in Q10), timing/sequencing (e.g., timelines in Q6.1, immediate actions in Q7.2), and exceptions (Q11 fully dedicated). Maps directly to description's phases without SQL or overt tech implementation.
  - **Comprehensiveness & Structure**: Thorough coverage of all described stages (initial contact/docs  database  assignment  meetings  inspection  marketing  screening  lease  audits), plus logical extensions like exceptions/comms. Numbered sections with bold headers enhance clarity without fluff; 24 questions form a tight "series" without redundancy.
  - **Conceptual Depth**: Questions probe nuances (e.g., Q4.2 examples for experiential insight, Q9.1 legal focuses) purely conceptually, avoiding code/scripts. Closing statement reinforces intent without excess.
  - **No Major Inaccuracies/Flaws**: All questions logically derive from description; no contradictions (e.g., Q3 aligns with "records... into database," Q6 with "schedules photographer/inspector").

- **Minor Deductions (Strict Hypercriticism Preventing 10.0)**:
  - **Q12 (Feedback/Improvement)**: Slight scope creep—description ends at audits/exceptions/comms; this adds an undescribed "lifecycle" element. Useful but not strictly clarifying *the given process*. (-0.4)
  - **Borderline Implementation Probes (3 instances)**: Q3.1 (db "fields mandatory/optional/structure"—schema-like, edges toward impl details), Q5.2/Q11.2 ("tools/frameworks/channels"—description already mentions email/CRMs/project tools; asking specifics risks impl). Conceptual enough (not SQL), but hyperstrictly, these could be purer (e.g., rephrase to processes sans tools). (-0.2 each, total -0.4)
  - **Nitpicks**: Q1.2 assumes "initial conversation" gathers key info (desc starts with contact then doc review—minor sequencing ambiguity). Q7.2's "promotional strategies" slightly speculative (desc mentions "short-term discounts" indirectly). No logical flaws, but -0.1 total for unclarities.

- **Overall**: Nearly flawless (92% perfection)—exceptional quality, exhaustive yet focused. Only tiny deviations from *absolute* prompt fidelity prevent 9.5+. Far exceeds "good" (e.g., vs. shallow lists scoring ~6-7).
