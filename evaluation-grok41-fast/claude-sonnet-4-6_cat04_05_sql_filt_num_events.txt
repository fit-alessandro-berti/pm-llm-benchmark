**8.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**: The primary SQL query is **logically correct** and achieves the exact requirement: it accurately identifies cases with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via `GROUP BY` + `HAVING`, then retrieves **all events** from those cases via `INNER JOIN`. All provided alternatives (window, CTE) are also **correct, efficient, and valid DuckDB SQL**. Explanations are generally clear, structured, and educational (e.g., `HAVING` vs. `WHERE`, avoiding `SELECT *`). Explicit column selection makes schema predictable. No syntax errors, no performance issues, handles grouping/filtering perfectly.
- **Flaws Deducting Points (strict deductions for each)**:
  1. **Inaccuracy in explanation (major deduction: -1.0)**: Step 2 table states "`Retains only `case_id`s with 6 events`", implying *exactly* 6 events. This contradicts the `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` (six or *fewer*) and prompt ("six or fewer"). Misleading; could confuse readers into thinking it's `= 6`.
  2. **Incomplete "full set of events" (significant deduction: -1.0)**: Queries select *only* `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`, but table has "**at least**" these columns (implying possible others, e.g., `user_id`, `resource`). "Full set of events" requires `SELECT *` (post-filter) to preserve all columns per row. This truncates data, violating "full set." Window alternative exacerbates by selecting 3 from `*` (discards others).
  3. **Unnecessary additions (minor deductions: -0.5 total)**: `ORDER BY` is not required (prompt doesn't specify ordering); adds unasked complexity. Double space in table ("with  6") is sloppy Markdown.
- **Overall**: Nearly flawless functionally (9+ potential), but explanation error + column omission are **logical flaws** per strict criteria ("inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws"; "minor issues...significantly lower"). Extras are bonuses but don't offset. 10.0 reserved for zero issues.
