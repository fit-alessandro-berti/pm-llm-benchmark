**6.0**

### Reasoning for Grade
- **Strengths (supporting mid-high score)**: Perfect syntactic format (valid Python dict with tuple keys/values, seconds units matching example). Comprehensive "representative subset" (~45 pairs, covering direct and multi-step, adding desired complexity). Logical structure (all pairs respect process order SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS). Realistic magnitudes for supply chain (e.g., procurement ~1 week, manufacturing/shipping days/weeks, full end-to-end ~2-3 weeks; SD scaling with distance/variability). Helpful explanation ties to domain knowledge.
- **Flaws (preventing >7.0; hypercritical deductions)**:
  - **Major logical inconsistencies in times (fatal for temporal model)**: Averages violate transitivity/monotonicity for linear flow. Examples:
    | Violated pair | Issue | Implied absurdity |
    |---------------|--------|-------------------|
    | ('SS', 'AS'): 1,296,000 (15d) | < ('SS', 'DT'): 1,641,600 (19d) | Time to AS < time to prior DT |
    | ('OP', 'AS'): 1,555,200 (18d) | = ('OP', 'DT'): 1,555,200 (18d) | No time for DTAS |
    | ('RC', 'AS'): 1,036,800 (12d) | < ('RC', 'DT'): 1,555,200 (18d) | Time to AS < time to prior DT |
    | ('CA', 'AS'): 691,200 (8d) | < ('CA', 'DT'): 777,600 (9d) | Time to AS < time to prior DT |
    - Systematic: Multiple cases where ('X', 'PT') = ('X', 'PK') despite PTPK (e.g., ('SS', 'PT')=1,036,800 = ('SS', 'PK'); same for OP/RC/QI prefixes). Breaks "eventually follow" model.
  - These ~10+ violations make profile unusable for deviation detection (e.g., ZETA thresholds incoherent).
  - Minor numerical slop: Non-round seconds (e.g., 483,840 5.6d ok but imprecise); mismatched comments (e.g., ('RC', 'AS') SD comment "5.6 days" but 432,000=5d).
  - Overkill scope: ~45 pairs exhaustive (not "subset"), risking dilution vs. focused representation.
- **Overall**: Strong effort/understanding but undermined by core logical flaws in data integrity. "Nearly flawless" requires consistent, usable values—no such errors. 6.0 reflects good format/domain fit offset by strict penalties for inaccuracies.
