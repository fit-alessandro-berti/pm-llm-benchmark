**6.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This grade reflects a strong structural adherence to the task (clear sections, per-case analysis, summary) and correct identification of *most* key issues, but is significantly penalized for **critical inaccuracies and omissions in normative violations**, **logical flaws in desiderata analysis**, and **minor unclarities/inconsistencies**. Even though the answer is mostly competent, the misses are not minor—they directly undermine completeness on core requirements like "identify...violating the normative rules and explain the reasons" and "identify which cases fail to meet the desiderata conditions." Under hypercritical standards, these result in a mid-tier score; a 9+ requires near-flawlessness.

#### Major Deductions (-2.0 total equivalent):
1. **Critical omission in Case 2 normative violations (-1.5)**: The answer correctly flags Risk Assessment before Credit Check and Finalize Documentation after rejection but **completely misses the skipping of "Inform Applicant"**, a mandatory step ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; sequence explicitly includes it after Decision for *both* approve/reject; "no skipping activities"). The log has *no* Inform Applicant row after Decision (09:30) before Finalize (10:00). This is a clear, separate normative violation (skipping required sequence step), yet the activities summary omits it without noting absence, and explanations ignore it. This is not pedantic—it's a core constraint violation parallel to the finalize error.
2. **Logical flaw in Case 2 desiderata (-0.5)**: Claims "none" and "not applicable due to...normative violations"—incorrect. Desiderata are explicitly *separate* ("In addition to the strict sequence"; "not considered a serious problem"). Case 2 fails desiderata independently: no Inform Applicant at all (fails "promptly...within 48 hours of the loan decision"), no Follow-up Call. Dismissing them creates a false hierarchy not in the problem statement.

#### Moderate Deductions (-1.0 total equivalent):
1. **Inconsistent/unclear handling of Follow-up Call desideratum (-0.6)**: Desiderata encourage it "sometime before closing the case" for *all* cases ("it is also encouraged"). Logs show none for *any* case (only explicitly noted for Case 3), yet answer flags only Case 3, calls it "not necessary" for Case 1 (wrong—it's encouraged, so suboptimal failure), and ignores for Case 2. This is selective/incomplete identification of desiderata failures across cases; task requires identifying *which cases* fail them.
2. **Minor incompleteness in Case 2 normative sequence explanation (-0.4)**: While ordering violation is flagged, doesn't tie it fully to "reverse their order" or full sequence diagram (e.g., Decision occurs without proper pre-Risk Credit *and* without post-Decision Inform). Partial credit, but hypercritical lens sees it as underdeveloped.

#### Minor Deductions (-0.6 total equivalent):
1. **Formatting/typo unclarities (-0.2)**: Case 1/3 activities lists use erratic spacing ("Application Received  Credit Check" instead of arrows/lists)—minor readability flaw.
2. **Overly vague justifications in Part 3 (-0.2)**: Generic ("administrative error", "workload") without tying to timestamps/logs (e.g., Case 2's ~1-hour Risk-before-Credit gap suggests specific rush error). "Might be necessary" hedges weakly.
3. **Summary slight overgeneralization (-0.2)**: Correctly notes Case 2 normative bad, Case 3 desiderata, but implies Case 1 perfect without acknowledging potential Follow-up desideratum miss.

#### Strengths (Supporting the Base ~8.0 before deductions):
- Excellent structure mirroring task (per-case, explanations, interpretations).
- Correct on Case 1 (flawless normative/desiderata).
- Correct timings for Case 3 desiderata (precise >24h/>48h calcs implicit).
- No new inventions; stays grounded in log/policy.
- Good clarification of desiderata as "not severe/suboptimal" in Case 3.

A 10.0 needs *zero* misses (e.g., full Case 2 violations: wrong order *+ skip Inform + wrong finalize); 8-9 for minor phrasing only. This is competent but flawed ~62% perfection.
