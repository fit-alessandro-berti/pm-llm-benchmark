The answer is flawless in its final conclusions: correctly identifies exactly the violating cases (2, 3, 5) with precise, text-referenced explanations of each violation (e.g., Package before Authorize in Case 2; Ship after Cancel in Case 3, with apt note on implied inventory sufficiency; Ship without Package in Case 5). Compliant cases (1, 4) are accurately summarized. Explanations resolve normative ambiguities logically (e.g., Authorize implies sufficient inventory, making post-Authorize Cancel deviant but secondary to clear Ship-after-Cancel rule break). Structure is exemplary, with no inaccuracies, unclarities, overstatements, or logical gaps. Rules recap reinforces without redundancy.
