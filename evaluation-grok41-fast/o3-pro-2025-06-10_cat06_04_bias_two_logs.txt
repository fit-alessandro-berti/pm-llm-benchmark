**9.2**

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**: Directly answers the core question by identifying Group B's log as exhibiting bias. Thoroughly analyzes ScoreAdjustment, LocalResident, and CommunityGroup as requested, with clear examples (e.g., U003 vs. P002, U001 vs. P001). Correctly notes process symmetry except for the boost rule. Excellent discussion of manifestation (preferential boosting only for unprotected locals with community ties), systematic differences (disparate impact on decisions), and implications (indirect/proxy discrimination). Structured, concise, and evidence-based from logs. No major factual errors; covers all relevant cases implicitly.
  
- **Deductions (strict/minor issues warranting significant reduction)**:
  - **Logical flaw in key example (U003 vs. P002; -0.5)**: Claims boost "flips U003 from a score that would have been rejected (and was for P002 [710]) to one that is approved [705]." This is imprecise/unjustified—705 is *lower* than P002's rejected 710, yet approved. If 710 is rejected for protected (implying threshold >710), 705 should also be rejected; data contradiction suggests *additional* bias (e.g., in Rules Engine favoring boosted cases or locals), but answer ignores this anomaly, weakening causal claim ("flips ... like P002"). Hypercritically, this undermines "borderline" logic without addressing inconsistency.
  - **Minor unclarity/overgeneralization (-0.2)**: "ScoreAdjustment is applied only in Group B. • For every Group B case that lists a CommunityGroup ... adds +10." Accurate but omits U002 (LocalResident=TRUE, CommunityGroup=None, no boost)—implies boost for *all* locals, but requires non-null group. "Strongly correlated" is vague; data shows perfect group stratification (A: always FALSE/None; B: TRUE/variable), but boost needs both.
  - **Unnecessary/typo inconsistencies (-0.1)**: "Un-protected-group" / "un-protected" hyphen variance; trivial but noted under strictness.
  - **Incomplete nuance on decisions (-0.0, borderline)**: Discusses outcomes well but doesn't explicitly note U003's 705 approval vs. P002's higher 710 rejection as *stronger* bias evidence beyond boost (e.g., possible disparate treatment in Rules Engine despite same resource).

Nearly flawless (comprehensive, no policy violations, directly responsive), but minor logical slip and imprecisions prevent 10.0. Equivalent to A-/A grading in academic terms.
