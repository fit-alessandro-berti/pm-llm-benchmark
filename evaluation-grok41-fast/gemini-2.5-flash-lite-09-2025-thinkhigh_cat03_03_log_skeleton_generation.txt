**2.1**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
- **Structural correctness (minor positive, +1.0)**: Dictionary has all required keys with correct types (sets of tuples for relational constraints, dict of sets for `activ_freq`). Python syntax is valid (curly braces denote sets).
- **Equivalence (+0.8)**: Correctly empty; no logical pairs in scenario.
- **Never Together (+0.9)**: Correctly empty; all activities co-occur in sequence per scenario.
- **Activity Occurrences (+1.2)**: Reasonable for "successful path" assumption (all {1}), covers all 10 activities. Minor deduction for RP ({1} ignores "once the customer pays" implying potential {0,1}), but not fatal.
- **Directly-Follows (+2.5)**: Excellent—captures precise linear flow (ROCARIPIQCPOGSLDICRP) matching scenario logic. No inaccuracies; assumes direct succession correctly for standard path.
- **Always After (+0.5)**: Partially correct but sparse/incomplete. ('RO','CA') and ('QC','PO') valid (sometime after), but ignores obvious others (e.g., ('RO','RI'), ('PI','PO')) derived from flow. Under-specified.
- **Always Before (catastrophic failure, -3.0)**: **Fundamental misunderstanding of definition**. Def: If *first* occurs, *second* previously (i.e., second  first). All 4 tuples inverted: e.g., ('CA','RI') wrongly implies RI before CA (opposite of scenario: CARI). ('PI','PO') explicitly notes "QC in between" (correct precedence PIPO) but codes wrong direction. Introduces *false* constraints, polluting model. Worse than empty set.
- **Overall completeness/logic (-1.8)**: Assumes rigid linearity (good for direct_follows) but fails to derive consistent constraints elsewhere (e.g., no ('D','GSL') in always_before for if D then GSL prior). Intro assumption stated but not fully enforced. Unclear/inaccurate comments exacerbate errors.
- **Clarity/pedagogy (-0.5)**: Comments reveal confusion (e.g., describes correct precedence but codes inverse).

**Total rationale**: Strong direct_follows/activ_freq carry weight (~40%), but core definitional error in always_before (25% of model) is disqualifying—actively incorrect constraints invalidate usability. Incompleteness elsewhere prevents "nearly flawless." Hypercritical lens demands near-perfection; this is ~20% accurate.
