**8.2**

### Justification (strict evaluation):
- **Strengths (driving high base score)**:
  - Perfect format: Valid Python dictionary with tuple keys `(activity1, activity2)` and tuple values `(avg, stdev)` in **seconds**, matching the example precisely (e.g., 86400 for 1 day, 3600 for 1 hour).
  - **Representative subset with complexity**: 21 pairs, including direct (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`, `('OP', 'RC')`) and multi-step indirect (e.g., `('SS', 'DT')`, `('QI', 'DT')`, `('CA', 'AS')`), spanning the full chain (SS to AS). Covers all 10 activities logically, assuming sequential order from scenario.
  - **Plausible domain estimates**: Times align with supply chain realities (e.g., OP-RC ~5 days/432000s for lead time, assembly/testing ~days, distribution/AS ~weeks). Stdevs are realistic (typically 20-50% of avg, higher for variable steps like supplier/distribution).
  - **Logical progression**: Averages increase with distance in chain (short: ~43k-86k s; long: ~1M-1.8M s). No reverse orders (e.g., no `('OP', 'SS')`).

- **Weaknesses (hypercritical deductions, -1.8 total)**:
  - **Minor logical flaws/inconsistencies (~ -1.0)**: Some indirect avgs don't perfectly sum direct segments (e.g., `('RC', 'PT')`: 345600s/~4d vs. RC-QI+QI-CA+CA-PT=~6d; `('QI', 'PT')`: 259200s/~3d vs. ~5d; `('RC', 'CA')`: ~3d vs. ~4d). Close approximations (10-30% off) acceptable for "estimated" from "multiple traces," but strict: sloppy math visible from direct pairs. Stdevs sometimes don't add variances properly (e.g., `('SS', 'RC')` stdev matches OP-RC alone, ignoring SS-OP).
  - **Unclarities/extras (~ -0.5)**: Inline comments (e.g., `# 1 day, 1 hour`) are explanatory but bloat the "pure" dictionary (example has none); not invalid Python, but unnecessary/verbose.
  - **Minor incompleteness (~ -0.3)**: Subset good, but no pairs like `('PT', 'AS')` or `('WS', 'AS')` for full coverage; stdevs occasionally arbitrary (e.g., `('PK', 'WS')` 21600s=~6h overly precise/low for storage variability).

Nearly flawless execution of core task (format, scope, estimation logic), but penalized heavily for avoidable inconsistencies per "utmost strictness." Perfect would require exact path-sum consistency + no extras.
