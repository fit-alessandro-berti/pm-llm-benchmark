**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
This answer is strong in structure, coverage, and clarity—using sections, tables, numbered lists, and a conclusion to systematically address every element of the question (process explanation, step purposes, gateways, paths/convergence/loops, standard/custom differences, approval/rework triggers). It accurately describes nearly all tasks, gateways (XOR exclusive choices, AND parallel split/join), convergence (post-path merge to approval XOR, post-approval to G then I), looping (type-specific back to D/E1, implying re-entry to approval), and early termination (custom no  E2  end). Inferences for purposes/triggers are plausible and detailed without fabricating unsupported elements.

However, **strict deductions for inaccuracies, logical flaws, and unclarities** (per instructions: even minor issues significantly lower score; not nearly flawless):

- **Major inaccuracy ( -1.0)**: Differentiation table (Section 5, core to question's "how tasks differ") wrongly states custom has **"Parallel Checks | Only if feasible (after B2)"**. Pseudo-BPMN has **no parallel checks (C1/C2) for custom**—they are exclusively in standard path after B1. This fabricates a conditional path that doesn't exist, misrepresenting process differences and potentially confusing flow. Custom skips parallels entirely (B2  XOR feasible  E1 or end).
  
- **Minor logical flaws/unclarities ( -0.3 each, total -0.6)**:
  - B1 purpose includes "product availability" and "customer credit limits," but these are explicitly handled later in C2/C1—implies premature/overlap validation not in diagram, muddying step distinctions.
  - Differentiation table "Approval Risk | Lower... | Higher...": Process uses **identical post-path XOR ("Is Approval Needed?")** for both types; no diagram evidence custom inherently triggers it more. Inferred bias distorts neutrality.
  - Section 6 triggers ("order value exceeds threshold," "customization exceeds standard capabilities"): Plausible but **unspecified in diagram**; over-specifies without caveat, risking presentation as fact.

- **Minor presentation issues ( -0.2 total)**: Table gateways (Section 4) accurate but could note custom rejection bypasses approval entirely. Conclusion slightly repetitive but ok.

**Total deductions: -1.8 from 10.0 baseline**. 8.2 reflects comprehensive excellence marred by one significant process misrepresentation and small flaws—strong but not "nearly flawless" under hypercritical standards. A 9.5+ requires zero substantive errors.
