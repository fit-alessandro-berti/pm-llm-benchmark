**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Base Score)**:
  - **Task 1 (Identification)**: Correctly identifies Cases 2002, 2003, 2005 as significantly longer (outliers vs. 2001/2004). Relative comparisons (e.g., 5–7x longer) hold logically even with calc errors.
  - **Task 2 (Analysis)**: Excellent structure with table, correlations precise (Complexity  #requests  duration; cautious on Region/Resource small sample). Accurately counts requests (0/1/2–3) and links to delays. No logical flaws in deductions.
  - **Task 3 (Explanations/Suggestions)**: Root causes well-explained (e.g., iterative requests add wait time, with examples). Mitigations practical, targeted (e.g., pre-identify docs, AI, training, alerts). Summary concise and comprehensive.
  - Clarity/Structure: Flawless—tabular, bulleted, readable. Covers all attributes (Resource/Region/Complexity).

- **Weaknesses (Strict Deductions for Inaccuracies/Flaws)**:
  - **Factual Inaccuracies in Durations** (Major Penalty: -1.0): 
    - 2002: Stated 27.9h; actual ~25.92h (04-01 09:05 to 04-02 11:00 = 24h + 1h55m).
    - 2003: Stated 50.5h; actual ~48.33h (04-01 09:10 to 04-03 09:30 = 48h + 20m).
    - These ~5–8% errors undermine precision; durations are core evidence for "significantly longer."
  - **Minor Misstatements** (Penalty: -0.5): 
    - "Case 2003’s second request took 6 hours (17:00–23:00)": No event at 23:00; next is 04-02 16:00 (~23h later). Implies nonexistent timeline.
    - 2004 duration "1.4 hours" (actual 1.42h): Trivial but cumulative sloppiness.
  - **Unclarities/Overstatements** (Penalty: -0.3): Region B "longer waits... compared to Region A" is vague (driven by #requests, as noted, but not quantified, e.g., no inter-step time analysis). Resource conclusion solid but could note Lisa's 4 requests total vs. Mike's 2 for balance.

- **Overall**: Nearly flawless analysis/logic (9.5+ potential), but numerical inaccuracies (even if not outcome-changing) and minor misstates prevent "very high score." Hypercritical adjustment yields 8.2—strong but penalized for precision lapses.
