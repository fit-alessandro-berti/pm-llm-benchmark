**7.2**

### Rationale for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: Questions are consistently open-ended ("How," "What," "Who"), avoid SQL/technical implementation entirely, and generally aim at conceptual deepening (e.g., #2 on decision criteria, #5 on exceptions). Good coverage of roles (#4), exceptions (#3, #5), compliance (#7), and communication (#6). List format with categories aids clarity. Correct self-correction from <think> ignored.
- **Weaknesses (major deductions for strictness)**: 
  - **Incomplete coverage of key prompt areas**: Minimal focus on **timing/sequencing** (only #11 vaguely touches it; no probes on e.g., order from docs to activation, move-in scheduling). Weak on **missing details** from description (e.g., no questions on property manager assignment factors like workload/geography/experience, photographer/inspector specifics, marketing/pricing models, tenant screening logistics like credit checks/references, security deposit collection).
  - **Irrelevant or mismatched questions**: #8 (lessons learned/feedback), #10 (long-term success metrics), #12 (training for "new protocols"/"smooth adoption") stray into meta-process improvement/company ops, not clarifying *this* onboarding process—logical flaw, as they don't "enhance clarity on this complex property onboarding process." #11 introduces unmentioned "seasonal demands."
  - **Vague/unprecise phrasing**: #1 ("current resources"—ambiguous); #3/#5 add external examples (supplier issues, culturally specific tenants) not in description, diluting targeting. #4 ("technical needs"—process lacks early "technical" emphasis). Wordiness/buzzwords (e.g., "seamless collaboration," "dynamic adaptations") reduces sharpness.
  - **Missed opportunities for direct ties**: No questions on core description elements like landlord intro call, repair handling post-inspection, multi-tenant complexity, CRM/email tracking, or audits (compliance officer/financial/IT roles vaguely implied but not probed).
  - **Minor logical flaws**: Summary claims "avoiding... procedural queries" (prompt allows procedural if conceptual); overemphasizes "systemic"/"human-centric" vs. process-specific.
- **Overall**: Solid ~70% alignment (good structure/relevance in 6-7 questions), but gaps in coverage, 3 flawed questions, and imprecisions prevent >8.0. Nearly flawless would require 100% tight mapping to description's steps/areas with zero drift.
