**3.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Strengths (partial credit)**:
  - Format: Valid Python dictionary syntax (Python 3.6+ underscore literals work). Keys are correct ordered tuples of all listed activities. Values are tuples of (avg, stdev) in seconds. Code block is clean and executable.
  - Coverage: Excellent—41 pairs covering direct (9/9), skip-1 (8/8), and multi-step (24+), nearly exhaustive (45 possible in linear order). Adds complexity as required ("pairs separated by multiple steps").
  - Plausibility: Individual estimates are realistic for supply chain (e.g., supplier delays 1-2 days, assembly/testing 1-2 days, distribution/after-sales weeks). Std devs scale roughly with distance (~30-50% of avg, reasonable for accumulated variance). Comments aid readability.
  - Explanation: Clear categorization (direct/skip/long-range); acknowledges estimates need real log data.

- **Major Inaccuracies & Logical Flaws (heavy deductions)**:
  - **Non-accumulating averages violate core model**: In a linear process (SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS, as implied by "each execution involves the following activities"), avg time for AC *must*  avg(AB) + avg(BC) if B always interleaves. This answer fails catastrophically:
    | Pair | Expected Sum (days) | Listed (days) | Error |
    |------|---------------------|---------------|--------|
    | QIPT | 1 + 2 = 3 | 2 | Major (shorter than subsegment!) |
    | PTWS | 0.25 + 1 = 1.25 | 3 | Major (inflated) |
    | WSAS | 3 + 7 = 10 | 7 | Major |
    | OPCA | 2 + 0.5 + 1 = 3.5 | 3 | Significant |
    | RCPT | 0.5 + 1 + 2 = 3.5 | 2.5 | Significant |
    | SSAS | ~17.8 | 14 | Significant |
    | QIWS | ~4.25 | 3 | Significant |
    | CADT | ~6.25 | 4 | Significant |
    | PTAS | ~11.25 | 7 | Major |
    - ~80% of skip/multi-step pairs mismatch sums by 20-50%+. Some (e.g., QIPT < QICA) *impossible* on average without negative times or frequent skips (unsupported by scenario).
  - **Std dev inconsistency**: Scale proportionally but ignore accumulation (should be (var_i)  proportional to distance, not distance). Minor but compounds flaw.
  - **Explanation mismatch**: Claims "accumulated uncertainty" for long-range, but values don't accumulate—self-contradictory.

- **Minor Issues (further deductions)**:
  - Intro text: Typos ("temporalprofile", "globalsupplychain", "average_timesecondsstandard_deviationseconds" run-on). Unnecessary bold/prose; prompt wants just dict.
  - Not *all* pairs, but "representative subset" ok—yet near-exhaustive with errors worse than sparse but consistent.
  - No evidence of trace-based computation (e.g., no variance formula); pure invention without internal logic.

Nearly flawless requires consistent, logical estimates matching linear chain semantics. This has ~dozens of arithmetic/logical errors despite great structure—unacceptable for "temporal profile" model. Equivalent to correct skeleton with garbage data.
