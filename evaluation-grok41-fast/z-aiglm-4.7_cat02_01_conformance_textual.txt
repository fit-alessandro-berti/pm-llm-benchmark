The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It correctly identifies exactly the violating cases (2, 3, and 5) with no omissions or false positives (Cases 1 and 4 implicitly conform by exclusion, which aligns with the task). Explanations are precise, directly quote or paraphrase key textual constraints (e.g., "Once the payment is authorized...", "'Ship order' should... never after a cancellation", "Only after items have been properly packaged..."), resolve ambiguities logically (e.g., no authorization in cancel path; strict sequencing), list multiple violations per case where applicable without overreach, and use clear structure with sequences for verifiability. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or extraneous content in the final conclusions.
