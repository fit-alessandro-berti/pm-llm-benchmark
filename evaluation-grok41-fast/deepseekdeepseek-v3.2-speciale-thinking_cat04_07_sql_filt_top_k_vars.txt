**10.0**

The provided SQL query is nearly flawless and fully satisfies all requirements with precise DuckDB syntax, correct logical structure, and robust handling of ordered sequences via `ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp)`. 

### Key Strengths (Hypercritical Validation):
- **Ordered sequence extraction (Req. 1)**: `ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp)` per `case_id` correctly produces comparable array representations of variants, preserving timestamp order. Handles variable-length sequences, single-activity cases, and equal timestamps (stable per SQL aggregate semantics).
- **Grouping and counting variants (Req. 2-3)**: Groups by `variant` array (equality-comparable in DuckDB), counts cases accurately via `COUNT(*)`.
- **Top K selection**: `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC)` deterministically ranks (though tie-breaking relies on internal stability; minor but acceptable as spec omits tie specification—ROW_NUMBER ensures *exactly* K variants). Filters precisely to top K.
- **Event filtering/return (Req. 4)**: Correctly identifies qualifying `case_id`s via `IN` subquery on arrays, joins back to `event_log` for `SELECT e.*`, excluding non-top-K cases entirely. Returns original columns/events unchanged.
- **DuckDB compatibility**: Fully valid syntax (`ARRAY_AGG` with `ORDER BY`, CTEs, window functions, array `IN`, parameter `?`). Efficient for typical process mining logs.
- **Parameterization**: `?` for K with clear comment enables flexibility without hardcoding.
- **Extras**: Final `ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp` enhances readability without altering semantics (not required but beneficial).
- **No extras/inaccuracies**: No extraneous columns, no mutations, no assumptions on data (e.g., unique timestamps). Edge cases (empty log, K=0/1, all cases same variant) handled implicitly.

### No Deductions Applied:
- No syntax/logic errors, ambiguities, or inefficiencies impacting correctness.
- Tie-handling: Spec-agnostic; ROW_NUMBER is a valid, common choice (deterministic enough; full tie-breaker like `ORDER BY case_count DESC, variant` optional).
- Parameter: Placeholder with replacement instruction is standard for benchmarks.
- Performance/readability: Optimal CTE chaining, no redundant scans.

This query executes correctly on any conforming `event_log` and produces the exact required output.
