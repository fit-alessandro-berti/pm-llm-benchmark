**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (supporting score above 5)**:
  - Correct format: Valid Python dictionary with tuple keys (earlier-to-later activities) and value tuples (avg, stddev in seconds).
  - Realistic sequential order assumed: Matches scenario's listed order (SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS).
  - Includes multi-step pairs for complexity (e.g., ('SS', 'DT'), ('CA', 'AS')), fulfilling "representative subset" and "separated by multiple steps."
  - Times generally realistic for supply chain: Short for adjacent (e.g., ('RC', 'QI'): 1 day), longer for distant (days/weeks for manufacturing, months for AS). Std devs scale reasonably with distance/variability.
  - Many short/medium pairs additive (e.g., SS-RC 7d = SS-OP 2d + OP-RC 5d; PT-DT 4d = PT-PK 1d + PK-WS 1d + WS-DT 2d).
  - 40/45 possible ordered pairs (91% coverage), representative and complex (~40 entries vs. example's 2).

- **Inaccuracies/Logical Flaws (deducting to 7.2)**:
  - **Non-additive averages (major flaw, -1.5)**: In sequential process, avg(A,Z)  avg(A,Y) + avg(Y,Z) for Y between. Holds for most (e.g., to DT/PK), but *all* *-AS avgs inflated vs. chain sums by ~10-13 days (e.g., SS-AS 60d vs. SS-DT 17d + DT-AS 30d = 47d, extra 13d; PT-AS 47d vs. 34d chain, extra 13d; OP-AS 55d vs. 45d, extra 10d). Inconsistent extras (13d common, OP 10d mismatch). Violates temporal model logic for "average times between... activities that eventually follow."
  - **Incomplete/odd pair selection (moderate flaw, -0.8)**: Misses exactly 5 pairs to WS (('SS','WS'), ('OP','WS'), ('RC','WS'), ('QI','WS'), ('CA','WS')), but includes pairs skipping WS (e.g., ('SS','DT'), ('CA','DT')) and all post-PT to WS. Arbitrary/unrepresentative gap for "eventually follow" in every trace; undermines completeness despite "subset."
  - **Minor std dev issues (minor, -0.3)**: Scale with distance but not rigorously (e.g., no clear sqrt-sum-squares for variance propagation); some large for short intervals (e.g., ('SS','OP') std 1d  avg 2d, plausible but not derived).
  - **No traces/logs justification (minor unclarity, -0.2)**: Estimates ungrounded (prompt bans "explicit numerical... in prompt," but no derivation shown); slight OP-AS mismatch suggests calculation error.

- **Why not higher/lower?** Nearly flawless would require *all* ~45 pairs, perfect additivity (e.g., fix AS chains to sum precisely), derived std devs, no gaps/mismatches (10.0). Below 7 ignores strong structure/coverage/effort. 7.2 reflects "good but flawed" under utmost strictness—logical inconsistencies prevent "very high."
