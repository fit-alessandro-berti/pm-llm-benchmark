**9.8**

The graded answer is nearly flawless in its final content: it precisely identifies the XOR branching as creating divergent paths (D with uplift vs. skip without), correctly links this to subtle bias via institutional assumptions favoring locals (a non-legally protected group per the query), and rigorously discusses implications (disproportionate advantage, structural inequity excluding migrants/rural/etc., cumulative disparities, opacity). Logical flow is tight, evidence ties directly to model comments (e.g., "subtle score uplift"), and recommendations enhance equity analysis without overreach. Minor deduction only for slight overgeneralization in "higher scrutiny" for skips (model implies no uplift, not necessarily more scrutiny) and phrasing "unconscious/external biases" (uplift could be explicit policy, though query frames it as subtle bias). No factual errors, ambiguities, or flaws in conclusions.
