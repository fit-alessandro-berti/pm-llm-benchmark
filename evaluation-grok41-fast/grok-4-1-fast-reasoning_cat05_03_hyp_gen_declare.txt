**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies Identification (10/10)**: Flawless. Precisely identifies core contradictions (responded_existence forcing E after A, noncoexistence blocking C after E, clashing with existence of C). Correctly highlights impossibility for intended flow (RAEPNC), undesired shortcuts (e.g., RC), and under-specification (no P/N sequencing). Logical, clear, comprehensive—no flaws.
  
- **Hypotheses Generation (10/10)**: Perfect match to prompt examples. Four distinct, plausible reasons (misinterpretation, incremental changes, data issues, business pressure). Insightful, business-relevant, no redundancies or stretches.

- **Verification Approaches (5.5/10)**: Major logical flaws and inaccuracies in SQL execution undermine credibility, despite good intent and coverage of prompt examples (closed w/o eval, E+C coexistence, assignment-eval links). 
  - **Strengths**: Queries 2 (E+C coexistence: correct GROUP/HAVING on filtered events) and partial 3/5 (count-based AE checks). Good purposes tied to anomalies; includes adjusters as per schema/examples; suggests refinements (e.g., timestamps).
  - **Fatal Flaws**:
    | Query | Issue | Severity |
    |-------|--------|----------|
    | 1 | WHERE `activity='C'` excludes E rows; COUNT(CASE `activity='E'`) always 0. Returns **all** C-claims, not C w/o E. Requires subquery/NOT EXISTS/LEFT JOIN. | Critical—core example query fails entirely. |
    | 3 | Counts totals, ignores temporal "responded" (E **after** A). Self-notes need for timestamp subquery but doesn't implement—half-baked. | Major—misses DECLARE semantics. |
    | 4 | CTE GROUP BY `claim_id, activity` yields multiple rows/claim; WHERE `activity!='R'` doesn't isolate **first** event (needs ROW_NUMBER()/MIN per claim). UNION mishandles init/existence. Incorrect for `init`/`precedence`. | Critical—fails basic first-event logic. |
    | 5 | Risky `resource::INTEGER` cast (VARCHAR may fail/non-numeric "system"). Groups by `resource`/adjuster (misses cross-resource E after A). No `claims.claim_type` join for specialization check despite mentioning it. | Moderate—assumptive, incomplete. |
  - Overall: 2/5 executable/correct; others buggy. No aggregation/visualization executes flawlessly. Undermines "empirical check" claim.

- **Overall Structure/Clarity (10/10)**: Matches prompt exactly (3 sections, independent). Concise, professional, PostgreSQL-specific.
- **Composite**: Weighted average (anomalies/hypotheses 10, SQL 5.5) 8.2. Strong conceptual work elevated by structure; SQL bugs prevent 9+ ("nearly flawless"). Minor: Redundant query 5; no full temporal/precedence checks (e.g., C **after** R).
