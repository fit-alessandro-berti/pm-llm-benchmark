**9.7/10.0**

### Reasoning:
- **Strengths (excellent coverage)**: Accurately identifies all major starting nodes with exact volumes (2.0M, 3.5M, 5.0M), key processes (e.g., Create Requisition, Approve Requisition, Pack Goods, Process Return, Create Invoice, Ship Goods, Confirm Delivery, Close Order), timings (e.g., 300ms, 400ms), color-coding, branching (parallel/sequential flows), and multiple End nodes. Captures the overall purpose (business process flow for purchasing/sales/inventory) and metrics effectively.
- **Minor deductions (-0.3)**: Slightly misses explicitly naming the fourth start ("ReturnItem"), groups some processes loosely (e.g., "Send Order and Check Stock" aligns but isn't verbatim), and "Overall" metrics phrasing is interpretive (volumes are mostly at starts/process headers, not always labeled "Overall"). No major inaccuracies or omissions.
- **Why not 10?** Near-perfect, but tiny gaps in exhaustive label precision prevent max score. This is publication-ready analysis.
