**4.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Hypercritical Assessment)
- **Structure and Format (Perfect: +2.0)**: Dictionary uses correct tuple keys (earlier-to-later activities, assuming linear order), values as `(avg, stdev)` tuples, all in seconds. Presented in a clean Python code block. Representative subset (23 pairs) includes direct (~9) and indirect (e.g., skips 1–4 steps), adding complexity as required.
- **Coverage of Pairs (Good: +1.5)**: Includes logical "eventually following" pairs (no reverses, all valid in sequential SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS). Misses some (e.g., no SSAS, RCPT, full triangle completeness), but "representative subset" allows this.
- **Domain Realism (Poor: -2.0)**: Estimates wildly unrealistic for "global supply chain" high-tech electronics. Procurement (OPRC: 2h), receipt/inspection/assembly (days compressed to hours), distribution (WSDT: 3h; global shipping = days/weeks), after-sales (DTAS: 4h; post-sale support = days+). Rationale contradicts itself (e.g., "12h–2 days" but avg 2h; supplier lead times "1h–1d" avg 1h). Ignores "global" factors like international logistics, customs (should be 10^5–10^6s for many pairs).
- **Logical Consistency/Internal Math (Very Poor: -2.5)**: Fatal flaw—indirect avgs do **not** sum directs despite explicit claim ("sum of the average times"). Examples:
  | Pair | Listed Avg | Expected Sum of Directs | Mismatch |
  |------|------------|-------------------------|----------|
  | SSQI | 36000 | 3600+7200+1800=12600 | +234% |
  | QIPT | 18000 | 43200+3600=46800 | -62% |
  | RCCA | 21600 | 1800+43200=45000 | -52% |
  | CAWS | 18000 | 3600+1800+7200=12600 | +43% |
  | PKDT | 3600 | 7200+10800=18000 | -80% |
  Stdev RSS claimed but fails (e.g., SSRC: (1800²+3600²)4025 5400).
- **Estimation Quality/Variability (Mediocre: +0.5)**: Stdevs plausible ratios (~0.25–0.5×avg), but tainted by flawed base avgs. No zeros/negatives.
- **Extra Content (Minor Ding: -0.5)**: Task is "Produce a Python dictionary"; rationale is helpful but bloated/unnecessary, with false claims ("realistic... computed as sum", "RSS approximation... simplified") undermining credibility. Note on synthesis ok but admits invention.
- **Overall Flawlessness**: Multiple major logical/domain errors prevent >5.0. Effort evident, but hypercritical lens demands consistency, realism, and precision for high scores. Not "nearly flawless."
