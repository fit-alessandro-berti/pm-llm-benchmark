**1.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
- **Anomalies Identification (Fail, ~10% accuracy):** Lists the correct pairs from the profile (R-P, P-N, A-C, E-N), earning minor credit. However, descriptions are factually demolished: R-P (25h avg, 1h STDEV) falsely called "Receive to Assign" (actual R-A is 1h) with wrong STDEV ("10 minutes" vs. 1h); P-N correctly noted but hypo later swaps it; E-N description ok but no mention of low STDEV suspiciousness; A-C ok but ignores process skips. No quantification of "suspiciously short/long" deviations (e.g., no ZETA reference or thresholds). Misses others like low R-P STDEV or E-C. Unclear/inaccurate prose (e.g., "25 hours... STDEV 10 min").
- **Hypotheses (Fail, ~20% accuracy):** Mismatched to anomalies (e.g., hypo1 assigns R-A delay to R-P; hypo3 wrongly calls E-N "long 7 days" when it's P-N 5min short; hypo2/4 vague/redundant). Hypo reasons generic/not tied to profile (e.g., no backlog for P-N high STDEV, no rigid schedule for R-P low STDEV, ignores automation skips for E-N). Logical flaws: "manual entry for initial claim" ignores R already done; "rushed evaluation" contradicts own 7-day hypo swap. No coverage of profile anomalies like artificial rigidity.
- **SQL Verification (Catastrophic Fail, 0% functional):** Every query is invalid/broken:
  | Query | Issues |
  |-------|--------|
  | 1 | Wrong table (`claims` only); nonsensical `submission_date - date >25` (units? no events/timestamps); no time diffs; arbitrary dates unlinked to profile. |
  | 2 | No `adjuster_id` in `claim_events` (use `resource`); no time calc; pointless subquery. |
  | 3 | `claim_type`/`closure_time` absent from `claim_events` (join `claims` needed); no timestamp logic. |
  | 4 | No `closure_time`; vague `resource='home'`. |
  | 5 | No `evaluation_time`; `>5` meaningless. |
  No deviation calcs (e.g., `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ts2-ts1)) > avg + zeta*stdev`); no joins (`claims`, `adjusters`); no filters by anomaly pairs/resources/claims; no ZETA/grouping. Useless for verification.
- **Overall Structure/Independence (Partial, ~40%):** Follows sections; no direct instruction refs. But extraneous "Okay, let's tackle... Let me know..." violates "present independently"; verbose fluff.
- **Strictness Penalty:** Major factual errors (mislabels, swaps), logically incoherent (mismatched hypo/query), zero usable SQL = disqualifying. Minor structure saves from 1.0; nothing "nearly flawless."
