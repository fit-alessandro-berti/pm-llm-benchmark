**9.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is excellent overall—comprehensive, well-structured, logically sound, and directly addresses all requirements with a clear table, chronological ordering, attribute enrichment, source tracking, and detailed reasoning. It correctly identifies semantic alignments (e.g., "OrderValidation"  "Order Validated"), preserves unique events (Quality Check, Item Delivered), and enriches attributes thoughtfully. However, under utmost strictness, several issues prevent a perfect or near-perfect score:

#### Major Deductions (Logical Flaws / Inaccuracies, -0.5 total):
- **Tolerance violation on Payment event (-0.3)**: Prompt specifies "<2 seconds" tolerance *example* but emphasizes "if cannot confidently match, leave separate." 5s exceeds even "a few seconds" generously; merging as an "exception" admits uncertainty while proceeding, introducing a logical inconsistency. Semantic similarity is valid per "combination" rule, but hypercritically, this bends the explicit guideline without including *both* timestamps (as allowed) or leaving separate for confidence.
- **Primary timeline contradiction (-0.2)**: Prompt designates Log A as "“primary” timeline"; answer explicitly prioritizes B's timestamps (sound reasoning re: received vs. occurrence time, but overrides without acknowledging A's primacy in sorting/merging base. Minor rebellion against spec.

#### Minor Deductions (Unclarities / Inaccuracies, -0.3 total):
- **Timestamp formatting inconsistency (-0.1)**: Originals use ISO `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`; table uses non-standard `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (drops T/Z). Harmless but inaccurate reproduction; "UTC" header doesn't fully compensate.
- **Typo / unclarity in reasoning (-0.1)**: "Strict Matches ( 2s):" (missing <, extra space)—renders tolerance rule ambiguous.
- **Incomplete attribute handling for uniques (-0.1)**: Uses "—" for missing B attrs on A's Item Delivered (good), but doesn't explicitly note if/why no A attrs added to B's Quality Check (implied but undocumented).

#### Strengths (Supporting High Score):
- Perfect chronological order using justified primary ts.
- All attributes merged correctly (B's rich data + A's names).
- Semantic matching flawless (e.g., Shipped/Shipping at exactly 2s).
- Output format exemplary (table with sources).
- Reasoning exhaustive, transparent on choices/conflicts.
- No inventions, omissions, or extraneous events.

Nearly flawless execution elevates it to top tier, but strict policy on "any inaccuracies... significantly lower" caps below 9.5. Fixes above yield 10.0.
