9.0

The primary query (subquery with `IN`) is flawless: correctly uses grouping via `GROUP BY case_id`, `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`, and `SELECT el.*` to return the full set of events (all columns) for qualifying cases, precisely matching the requirements.

The CTE approach is also flawless: equivalent logic, explicit readability, `INNER JOIN` correctly filters to full events via `el.*`.

The window function approach has a significant flaw: it explicitly selects only `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp` (omitting any other columns the table "at least" has and the required "full set of events"), making it incomplete for the task. To fix, it would need `SELECT *` (excluding or including the window column post-filter). The claim that "All three approaches will... 2. Return all events belonging to those cases" is inaccurate and a logical error, as the window query demonstrably does not.

Explanations are accurate on functionality (for the working queries) and performance notes (window scans once, true in DuckDB), with good readability discussion. No syntax errors; all valid DuckDB SQL.

Overall excellent, exceeding the "a" query request with valid alternatives, but the window flaw + overstated claim prevent 10.0 under hypercritical standards (not "nearly flawless"). Minor over-delivery (three queries vs. one requested) is neutral/positive.
