**10.0**

This query is correct, efficient, and precisely fulfills the requirements without any inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. It accurately identifies `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via a subquery with proper `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then returns the full rows (`SELECT *`) for only those cases using `IN`. No unnecessary clauses, no performance issues for the task (subquery scans are standard and optimal here), and it handles all edge cases (e.g., empty table, cases with exactly 6 events, multiple events per case). Fully compliant with DuckDB SQL syntax and the event log schema. No deductions warranted.
