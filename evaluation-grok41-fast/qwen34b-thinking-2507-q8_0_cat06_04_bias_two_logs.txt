**9.5**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**:
  - **Correct Identification**: Accurately identifies **Group B** as exhibiting bias. Group A is correctly deemed unbiased (no adjustments, uniform treatment).
  - **Precise Manifestation**: Clearly explains bias via **ScoreAdjustment (+10 Community Boost)** tied to **CommunityGroup** ("Highland Civic Darts Club"). Key example (U003: 695  705 Approved vs. P002: 710 Rejected) is factually exact and demonstrates systematic advantage for lower base scores.
  - **Attributes Addressed**: Fully covers **LocalResident** (noted as baseline for B, not bias source), **CommunityGroup** (triggers boost), and **ScoreAdjustment** (direct mechanism). Links to **systematic differences** in decisions (reproducible approvals for club members).
  - **Structure & Clarity**: Table and numbered points are flawless—concise evidence mapping. Conclusion restates core without fluff.
  - **Logical Flow**: No contradictions; ignores irrelevancies (e.g., timestamps); infers threshold implicitly via examples without assuming unstated rules.
  - **Comprehensiveness**: Discusses real-world implications (e.g., non-transparency, harm) without speculation.

- **Minor Deductions (Strict Hypercriticism)**:
  - **Slight Overreach (0.3 pts)**: Claims boost at "*every stage*"—true for U001/U003 logs, but U002 has "0" (not N/A/boost); phrasing implies universality across all B cases, minor unclarity vs. "for club members."
  - **Interpretive Stretch (0.2 pts)**: "Unprotected label is misleading" and "false equity" add opinionated framing (bias as "deliberate privilege"); strong but not purely factual—question seeks *explanation of manifestation*, not policy critique.
  - **Tiny Incompleteness (0)**: No explicit approval rate comparison (both 2/3), but unneeded as focus is *systematic mechanism*, not aggregates.

Nearly flawless: Zero factual errors, no logical flaws, hyper-precise data use. Deduction only for phrasing polish; 10.0 requires zero subjectivity.
