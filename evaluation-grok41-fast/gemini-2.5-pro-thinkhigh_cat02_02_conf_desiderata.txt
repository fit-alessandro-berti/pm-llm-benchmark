**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It precisely addresses all three task components with accurate identification, clear explanations, logical structure, and no factual inaccuracies, unclarities, or omissions. 

- **Task 1 (Normative violations):** Correctly identifies only Case 2 as violating (Cases 1/3 compliant), with three precise, distinct violations directly tied to rules (ordering, skip of mandatory Inform Applicant, prohibited Finalize post-rejection). No extras/misses; quotes rules accurately.
- **Task 2 (Desiderata):** Logically scopes to normatively compliant cases (Cases 1/3) as "technically correct but suboptimal" per the problem's distinction ("in addition to the strict sequence"), clarifying non-severe nature explicitly. Identifies all relevant issues (Follow-up miss for both; timings for Case 3 with exact hour calcs). Case 2 appropriately excluded here (its Inform issue escalated to normative; timings compliant anyway; Follow-up miss secondary/not scoped).
- **Task 3 (Interpretations):** Provides balanced, plausible justifications for all cases aligned to constraints (e.g., "happy path" for 1, "weekend" for 3 delays, error causes for 2), without speculating beyond evidence.

Minor stylistic strengths (e.g., bolding, summaries) enhance clarity without flaws. No logical gaps, miscalcs (timings exact: Case 3 Credit ~49h >24h rec; Inform 51h >48h rec), or unaddressed log details. Perfect match.
