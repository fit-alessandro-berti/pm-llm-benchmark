**10.0**

The provided SQL query is correct, efficient, and fully satisfies all requirements with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws:

- **Sequence detection**: Uses `LEAD(activity, 1/2)` and `LEAD(timestamp, 1/2)` correctly over `PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp` to identify *direct* succession (immediate next events) of exactly `'Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order'`, with no intervening events.
- **Timing filter**: Precisely computes elapsed time as `next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp` (> `INTERVAL 5 DAY`), targeting the interval between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` in the matched triplet.
- **Case exclusion**: `NOT IN` subquery correctly identifies and excludes *all events* from cases with 1 matching (sequence + timing) triplet; retains all events from other cases.
- **Completeness**: Handles edge cases (e.g., incomplete sequences yield `NULL` LEADS, filtered out); deduplicates case_ids implicitly; no false positives/negatives.
- **Syntax/idioms**: Valid DuckDB SQL (`INTERVAL 5 DAY` is supported for interval literals; window functions efficient). No unnecessary grouping/ordering needed (prompt requires result correctness, not specific sort).
- **No extraneous issues**: No assumptions violated (e.g., timestamp ordering); scalable; readable.

Nearly flawless—zero deductions under hypercritical review.
