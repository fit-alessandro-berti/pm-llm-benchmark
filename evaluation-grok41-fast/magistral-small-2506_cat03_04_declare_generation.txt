**2.0**

### Critical Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Format Violations (Fatal, ~50% deduction)**: Binary keys ('response', 'precedence', 'succession', 'noncoexistence', 'nonsuccession') use invalid flat dicts with string values (e.g., `'CE': 'AG'`). Per prompt, binary constraints require nested dicts like `{act1: {act2: {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}}` (as correctly done only in 'coexistence'). No support/confidence values provided, rendering the dict unusable in pm4py. Inconsistent with even its own 'coexistence'.
- **Logical Flaws in Scenario Modeling (~30% deduction)**: Sequence mismatches list order (PC/LT/UT before AG, but model places AG before PC). Contradiction: 'existence' mandates all activities (including IG/FL) at support/confidence 1.0, but 'noncoexistence'('FL':'IG') forbids both occurring together—impossible in any valid trace. Arbitrary/unjustified 'coexistence' (only IG-DD, DD-TFC) and 'nonsuccession' add no value to linear flow.
- **Minor Issues (~10% deduction)**: Redundant 'precedence'/'succession' chains (succession implies direct, unnecessary duplication). 'exactly_one'/alternatives empty reasonable, but model ignores potential branches (e.g., no 'alt*' for testing variations). Verbose keys/comments irrelevant to dict validity.
- **Positives (Minimal Credit)**: All required keys present; single-activity keys ('existence', 'init') perfectly formatted; empties appropriate; attempts sequential logic.

Not nearly flawless—core dict is invalid for pm4py and logically incoherent. Minimal partial credit for structure/partial nesting.
