**7.5**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (why not lower)**:
  - Correctly uses `STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp)` in `sequence_per_case` CTE to extract ordered sequences per `case_id` (flawless handling of requirement 1).
  - Properly groups by sequence and counts cases per variant in `sequence_counts` (requirement 2 & 3 partially met).
  - Joins back to `event_log` correctly via `sequence_per_case` and `top_k_variants` to filter and return **all events** only from qualifying cases, excluding others (requirement 4 flawless; preserves original columns via `el.*` and adds sensible `ORDER BY`).
  - Clear structure with CTEs, readable explanation mapping to steps.
  - Handles ties in timestamps implicitly (acceptable, as unspecified).

- **Critical Flaws (major deductions)**:
  - **Top K selection is logically incorrect/unreliable**: `sequence_counts` has `ORDER BY case_count DESC`, but `top_k_variants` does `SELECT ... FROM sequence_counts LIMIT K` **without its own `ORDER BY`**. In DuckDB (and standard SQL), CTE order is **not preserved** downstream—`LIMIT K` on an unordered reference yields arbitrary rows, not the true top K by frequency. This fails requirement 3. Fix: Nest as subquery `SELECT activity_sequence FROM (SELECT ... ORDER BY case_count DESC LIMIT K)`. (-1.5 points; semantics broken, though might "work" coincidentally).
  - **K undefined/invalid SQL**: `LIMIT K` is not valid SQL (K unbound); comment "Replace K" makes it a template, not executable query. Benchmark expects general "top K" handling (e.g., parameter or subquery). Minor syntax error, but hypercritical: invalid as-is. (-1.0 point).

- **Minor Issues (further deductions)**:
  - Arbitrary `'->'` separator: Works but unspecified; could use `','` or none, but consistent so negligible (-0.0).
  - No handling for zero variants or K=0 edge cases: Implicitly fine via LIMIT.
  - Verbose explanation repeats query; not penalizing per instructions.

Nearly flawless structure/logic (90% correct), but core top-K flaw + invalid K = not "very high." Equivalent to B-/A- in strict academic grading.
