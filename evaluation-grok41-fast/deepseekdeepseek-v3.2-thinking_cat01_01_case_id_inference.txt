The final answer accurately identifies and groups all 18 events into exactly three cases based on unique patient profiles (45M, 62F, 28M), with perfect matching of every event's `patient_age` and `patient_gender`. Event lists are complete and exhaustive (Case 1: 5 events; Case 2: 7 events; Case 3: 6 events; total 18). Within-case timestamps are strictly increasing, and activity sequences are medically logical (e.g., registration  triage/tests  consultation/diagnosis  treatment  discharge/recovery). Cross-department referrals (Radiology for 45M's X-ray; Laboratory for 62F's lab test) are correctly retained in their respective cases without forcing implausible merges. Pathway summaries precisely reflect activities and `additional_info` (e.g., "hairline_fracture", "minor_infection", "scheduled_knee_surgery"). Case labels are descriptive yet objective. Rationale explicitly justifies groupings via attributes, logic, and interleaving, with no ambiguities, omissions, or errors. Presentation is structured, concise, and unambiguous.
