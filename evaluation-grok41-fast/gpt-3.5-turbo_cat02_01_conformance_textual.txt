**4.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Strengths (partial credit basis):** Correctly identifies Case 2 violation with accurate explanation tied to normative text ("Authorize before Package"). Partially correct on Case 3 (flags Ship after Cancel, which is explicitly forbidden; good reference to no fulfillment after Cancel). Clear structure, references normative description.
- **Major Inaccuracies (severe deductions):**
  - **Wrong classification of Case 4:** Labels as violating, but it perfectly matches the insufficient inventory path ("Receive, Check, Cancel, Close"). Normative text explicitly states "directly proceed to 'Cancel order'" after Check, with no mention of requiring "Authorize payment" in this branch—it's the *short sequence without fulfillment steps*. Claiming "skipping the payment authorization step before cancellation deviates" *invents a nonexistent rule*, directly contradicting the description ("shorter sequence—Receive, Check, Cancel, Close"). This is a fundamental misreading.
  - **Misses Case 5 entirely:** Case 5 violates by skipping "Package items" (sequence: Check  Authorize  *Ship*  Close). Normative mandates "Package after authorization and before shipping" ("items should be prepared... Only after... packaged is it appropriate to... Ship"). Implicitly treats Case 5 as compliant by omission, but it's deviant. Failing to identify all violating cases (actual: 2, 3, 5) fails Task 1.
- **Logical Flaws/Unclarities (further deductions):**
  - Case 3 explanation incomplete: Ignores "Authorize payment" after Check then Cancel (normative branches *directly* to Cancel if insufficient; Authorize implies sufficient path, making Cancel illogical/contradictory). Only flags Ship, missing full deviance.
  - Case 4 logic flawed: "Cancel occurs before Authorize" is meaningless (Authorize absent, as required); pretends pre-Cancel sequence includes Authorize, unsupported by text.
  - No explicit compliance statement for Cases 1/5 (Task implies full coverage; ambiguity left).
  - Minor: Generic closing sentence adds no value; doesn't resolve "ambiguities" (e.g., Case 3's Authorize-then-Cancel).
- **Overall:** ~66% case identification accuracy (2/3 listed correct, but wrong set + miss = incomplete). Explanations strong for listed items except Case 4 disaster. Not "nearly flawless"—core task botched by misclassification/invention of rules/miss. Strict rubric demands perfection for 9-10; this is competent-but-fatally-flawed analysis.
