**7.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**:
  - Excellent structure mirroring the task's 1-2-3 parts, with clear headings, bullets, and summary.
  - Accurately identifies Case 1 as fully compliant (normative and desiderata).
  - Correctly flags Case 2's two highlighted violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection) with precise timestamps and rule references.
  - Properly analyzes Case 3: no normative issues; desiderata violations correctly identified (Credit Check >24h, Inform >48h, no Follow-up) with timestamp calculations and clarification of "suboptimal/not severe."
  - Task 3 interpretations are reasonable, on-topic, and tied to behaviors (e.g., human/system error for Case 2; resource constraints for Case 3).
  - Summary is concise and accurate *for the violations it identified*.

- **Fatal Flaws (significant deductions for utmost strictness)**:
  - **Major inaccuracy in Task 1 (normative violations)**: Completely misses that Case 2 skips the mandatory "Inform Applicant" activity entirely. Rules explicitly state: "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision"; sequence requires it before Close Case (even for rejections); "skipping activities" not allowed. Log has Loan Decision (09:30)  Finalize (10:00)  Close (10:30), with no Inform Applicant. This is a clear, independent strict violation (third one), making Case 2 have *three* normative issues, not two. Not mentioning it renders the analysis incomplete and logically flawed—Case 2's close is invalid without it per "decision logic."
  - **Logical flaw spillover**: Interpretations (Task 3) and summary ignore this, failing to justify/interpret the skip. No suggestion (e.g., "perhaps notification bundled in decision, but log shows absence violating 'must inform'").
  - **Minor inaccuracy in Task 2 (desiderata)**: For Case 2, claims "no additional timing recommendations specified for this case" and "focus was on order rather than timing"—misleading, as desiderata (24h Credit Check, 48h Inform) are general/process-wide, not case-specific. Timings happen to be fine (Credit Check ~1h post-app), but phrasing implies they don't apply, showing unclarified logic.
  - **Minor unclarities**: Case 1 normative sequence uses spaces ("Application Received  Credit Check") instead of arrows/symbols (as in query), slightly unclear. Case 1 desiderata assumes "no missteps" without noting absent Follow-Up Call (encouraged for all; log lacks it, like Case 3).

- **Overall**: 85%+ flawless on structure/content, but missing a core normative violation (explicit "must"/sequence/skip rule) is a significant inaccuracy for Task 1 (primary). Per strictness directive, this alone warrants major deduction (e.g., from 10 to ~7 range); not "nearly flawless." Equivalent to ~70-75% completeness on violations. No criminal/low-policy issues.
