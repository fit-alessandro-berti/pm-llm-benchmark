**10.0**

The final process tree perfectly captures the observed behavior with optimal fitness (reproduces all traces exactly, including consecutive RMIs in case 3 via loop redo with tau), precision (prevents invalid traces like VF after AE without RMIs or RMI without subsequent VF; enforces single VF per optional block), and simplicity (minimal operators, binary nesting as defined, no extraneous elements like parallelism). Notation is precise (operators, tau unquoted, labels abbreviated consistently with log/example, balanced parentheses). No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws.
