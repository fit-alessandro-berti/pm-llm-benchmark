**1.0**

The graded portion (post-<think>) is catastrophically incomplete: it outlines a structure and begins Task 1 but provides zero actual data (no resolution times listed, no identification of long cases), and entirely omits Tasks 2 and 3 (no root causes, explanations, insights, or recommendations). This fails to address any of the prompt's requirements, rendering it non-responsive and logically void. No conclusions or final statements exist to evaluate positively.
