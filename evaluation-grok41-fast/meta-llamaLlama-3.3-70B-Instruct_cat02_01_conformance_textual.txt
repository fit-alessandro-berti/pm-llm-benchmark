**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (accounting for ~9.5 base)**: Correctly identifies all violating cases (2, 3, 5) and spares the compliant ones (1, 4) implicitly but clearly. Explanations are well-structured, directly reference the normative description's key constraints (sequence, conditionality, logic), and interpret ambiguities reasonably (e.g., cancellation must directly follow check for insufficient inventory; authorize only makes sense post-check for sufficient cases). Case-specific violations are accurate: Case 2's reversed package/authorize (violates "before packaging"); Case 3's ship-after-cancel (explicit "never after cancellation") and cancel-after-authorize (violates direct branch); Case 5's skipped package (violates "only after packaged to ship"). General explanation reinforces principles without fluff. Clear, concise, logical flow.

- **Deductions (hypercritical flaws totaling -0.8)**:
  - **Minor incompleteness in Case 3 explanation (-0.4)**: Identifies two violations accurately but omits the explicit third: shipping without any preceding "Package items," which independently violates the general rule ("Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order'"). This is noted precisely for Case 5 ("bypasses... Package items") but not Case 3, creating a subtle inconsistency in thoroughness when explaining "what rules... are being violated." Even though subsumed under "ship after cancel," strict task requires full enumeration of violated expectations per case.
  - **Slight overgeneralization in phrasing (-0.2)**: Case 3's second violation says "cancellation should occur *immediately* after checking" (emphasis added)—"immediately" is interpretive (description says "directly proceed," not timestamp-strict), introducing minor ambiguity resolution not explicitly supported, though defensible.
  - **Lack of explicit compliance note (-0.2)**: Task asks to "identify which cases... deviate," but best practice (for completeness) would briefly confirm non-violators (1, 4 match flows perfectly); omission is minor but leaves tiny unclarity on full coverage.

Nearly flawless overall—precise, evidence-based, no major errors—but these nitpicks (even minor) warrant deduction per instructions. A 10.0 requires zero issues.
