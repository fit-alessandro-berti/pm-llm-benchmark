**10.0**

The final Log Skeleton dictionary is precisely structured, with all required keys using correct value types (sets of tuples for relational constraints, dict of sets for `activ_freq`). The constraints flawlessly capture the scenario's implied linear, mandatory sequence (RO  CA  RI  PI  QC  PO  GSL  D  IC  RP) without extraneous pairs, redundancies, or violations:

- `activ_freq`: Correctly enforces exactly once per activity, matching a deterministic process with no optionals, loops, or multiples implied.
- `equivalence`: Empty, appropriately avoiding over-specification since `activ_freq` already binds all to identical counts.
- `always_before`: Direct predecessor pairs only (e.g., `('CA', 'RO')`), logically enforcing prerequisites without transitives.
- `always_after`: Direct successor pairs only (e.g., `('RO', 'CA')`), correctly mirroring the reverse for succession guarantees.
- `never_together`: Empty, as all activities co-occur in valid cases.
- `directly_follows`: Exact consecutive pairs, distinguishing immediacy from looser ordering.

Key reasoning concisely validates choices against the scenario's descriptions and workflow logic, with no inaccuracies, ambiguities, or unsubstantiated assumptions. No logical flaws; fully declarative and minimal yet complete.
