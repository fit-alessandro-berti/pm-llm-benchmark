**9.2**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: Correctly identifies violating cases (2, 3, 5) with no misses or false positives (1 and 4 properly cleared). Explanations are structured, tabular, and directly reference the normative text (e.g., "directly proceed," "illogical to continue," "package before ship"). Interpretations resolve ambiguities logically and conservatively (e.g., "directly" as strict, Package as mandatory, no exceptions for shipping post-cancel). Summary is concise and accurate. Coverage of multiple violations per case is comprehensive.
  
- **Inaccuracies/Logical Flaws (deductions)**:
  - **Minor logical misattribution (Case 5 under rule b)**: Rule b specifies "Authorize payment ... **before** 'Package items'." Case 5 has no Package, so it vacuously satisfies "before Package" (no Package after to violate it). The violation is sequence omission (properly under c/d), not positioning relative to a non-existent Package. Phrasing "breaking the 'authorisation packaging shipping' sequence" papers over this; deducts 0.4 for flawed rule application.
  - **Imprecise phrasing (Case 5 violations table)**: "Ships the order without ever performing ... (i.e., shipping occurs **before** packaging)." Logically false—no packaging occurs at all, so shipping cannot precede it (no temporal "before" relation). This is sloppy logic, implying packaging happens later. Deducts 0.3.
  - **Overreach in rule e (Case 3)**: Claims "*the very next activity must be Cancel order*" based on "directly." Text says "should directly proceed," not "must" or "very next." Interpretation is reasonable but not ironclad ("directly" could allow brief gaps); minor overinterpretation. Deducts 0.1.

- **Unclarities**: None major; tables are clear, but rule b's inclusion of Case 5 creates slight confusion (why list under b if c covers it?).

Nearly flawless in substance (95%+ accuracy), but strict policy demands significant penalty for even these minor issues (total -0.8). No other flaws (e.g., no misses on Case 2's reversal or Case 3's ship-post-cancel).
