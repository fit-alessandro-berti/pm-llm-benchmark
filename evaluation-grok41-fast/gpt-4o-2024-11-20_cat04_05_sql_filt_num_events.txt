The provided answer is nearly flawless: the SQL query is logically correct, syntactically valid for DuckDB (standard SQL features like CTEs, GROUP BY, HAVING, and INNER JOIN work identically), and precisely achieves the task. It accurately identifies `case_id`s with 6 events via the CTE's `HAVING` clause (post-aggregation filter), then retrieves *all* events (`e.*`) for exactly those cases via INNER JOIN, excluding all events from cases with >6 events. No data leakage, no extra rows/columns, no inefficiencies impacting correctness (e.g., CTE materializes efficiently in DuckDB).

The explanation is precise, step-by-step, and mirrors the query logic without errors or ambiguities. Minor stylistic elements (e.g., aliasing unused `event_count`, lack of ORDER BY) are irrelevant as they do not affect results and are not required by the prompt. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws detected under hypercritical scrutiny.
