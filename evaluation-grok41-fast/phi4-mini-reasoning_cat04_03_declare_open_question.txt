**6.2**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Well-structured with clear sections, covers high-level concepts (compliance via absence, exactly_one for credit check, sequences via precedence/succession, regulatory speculation like KYC/AML). Addresses question elements like interplay (e.g., credit check once, QA mandates, fund prevention), real-life meanings, business goals (risk, transparency), and scenarios. Speculates reasonably on rigidity.
- **Major Deductions (inaccuracies/logical flaws, -2.0 total)**:
  - **Factual model misinterpretation**: Succession incorrectly stated as "Preliminary_Credit_Check  Quality_Assurance_Review" (BE); model specifies BC (Gather_Additional_Documents). This is a core error in explaining sequence shaping.
  - **Logical flaw in noncoexistence**: Claims it "blocks funds unless application processed" (implying prerequisite); DECLARE noncoexistence(G, A) means G *and* A cannot both occur (not(exists G  exists A)), contradicting loan logic where both must occur (A first, G last). Misrepresents constraint's practical enforcement.
  - **Directionality error in altresponse**: Describes "Transfer_Funds  Notify_Customer" as "requir[ing] notification *before* disbursement"; model arrow implies G then H (post-disbursement notify?), inverting real-life (notify before transfer). Undermines transparency claim.
- **Minor Deductions (unclarities/incompleteness, -1.5 total)**:
  - Skips/explains shallowly many rules (e.g., init, responded_existence DE, chainprecedence FB [backward/illogical], nonchainsuccession FH, chainresponse DG). Question demands "each...constraints"; grouping hides gaps.
  - Vague/overgeneralized interplay (e.g., "preventing circular dependencies" unsubstantiated; no deep dive on "exactly once" preventing duplicates or noncoexistence blocking premature G).
  - Speculation good but superficial (e.g., no specific regs like FCRA for credit checks, Dodd-Frank for QA).
  - Unclear phrasing: "Succession...lead[ing] to QA" despite error; scenarios invent "re-run credit checks" loosely tied to model.
- **Why not lower?** No outright fabrication; structure aids readability; corrects to positive real-life framing. **Why not higher?** Model analysis core to question—multiple verifiable errors prevent "nearly flawless." Strict rubric demands precision.
