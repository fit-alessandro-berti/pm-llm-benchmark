**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**: The list is exceptionally well-structured by process phases, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all required areas (missing details, e.g., Q2/Q10/Q17; decision criteria, e.g., Q1/Q5/Q13; roles/responsibilities, e.g., Q4/Q11/Q16; timing/sequencing, e.g., Q3/Q9/Q25; exceptions, e.g., Q8/Q10/Q19). All questions are open-ended, targeted, and directly tied to the described process without requesting SQL or overt implementation details. They deepen conceptual understanding effectively (e.g., Q20/Q22/Q23 address process improvement and flexibility holistically). No factual inaccuracies or logical flaws in question logic; progression is logical and builds clarity.

- **Minor Flaws (Deductions for Strictness, Preventing 10.0)**:
  - Q27 ("How has the onboarding process evolved...") deviates slightly from the prompt's focus on clarifying *the described process*—it's retrospective/meta rather than uncovering missing details/decision criteria/etc. of the current flow (-0.3).
  - Q26 ("communication channels and tools") borders on implementation details (e.g., specific tools like CRMs mentioned in the process), though conceptual; prompt explicitly avoids "implementation details," making this a gray-area risk (-0.2).
  - Q6 ("training or resources") and Q7 ("prevent burnout") introduce unsubstantiated assumptions (training/burnout not in description), slightly leading vs. purely clarifying (-0.2).
  - Excessive length (28 questions) risks dilution/overkill for "a series," though structured well; minor redundancy (e.g., exceptions in Q19-20/Q23) (-0.1).

Nearly flawless execution, but these nitpicks warrant deduction under hypercritical standards.
