**6.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Output Only):
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**:
  - Correct structure: Markdown table with required minimum columns + logical "Other Attributes" as dedicated columns (e.g., customer_*, item_*, delivery_*, invoice_*, payment_*). Excellent coverage of attributes from all tables (e.g., item_description from Products, resource names from Resources).
  - Case ID correct (order_id).
  - Activity names precisely match/align with prompt suggestions (Order Created, Item Picked, Order Dispatched, Order Arrived, Invoice Issued, Payment Received).
  - Timestamps accurate for **all included events**.
  - Resources/Actors correctly mapped/enriched where data exists (e.g., SP-001  Alice Brown, WH-*  names, CR-*  carriers, BL-*  names); "System" for payments is reasonable.
  - Chronological sorting by Timestamp across cases (correct for process mining).
  - Handles multiples correctly (e.g., 1002 has 2 picks, 2 deliveries  4 events, 2 invoices  2 events + payments).
  - Missing data handled implicitly (no delivery/invoice/payment for 1004; no events created).
  - 32/34 expected rows present; comprehensive for 4/5 cases.

- **Critical Flaws (major deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Incompleteness/missing events (primary inaccuracy, -2.0)**: Order Lines table has **2 events for order_id 1003** (ITEM-002 picked 2024-01-05T15:30:00Z by WH-003/Frank Miller; ITEM-006 picked 2024-01-05T15:45:00Z by WH-001/David Lin; descriptions Widget B/Part P). **No rows for these**. Violates "ensure every event for every order_id is included", "integrate the data from these tables", "Items Picked event(s) from the Order Lines table". Order 1003 appears to skip picking (illogical flow: created  dispatched without picking).
  - **Chronological un-correctness (indirect, -0.5)**: Gap on 2024-01-05 (after 1001 Arrived 14:45Z jumps to 1003 Dispatched 06th 07:30Z); missing events would insert here, breaking full flow.
  - **Missing attributes (logical flaw, -0.5)**: Payments rows leave `invoice_id` **blank** despite available in Payments table (e.g., PAY-2001  INV-1001). Should fill as "Other Attributes" (traceability reduced; violates linking via keys).
  - **No documentation of assumptions (-0.5)**: Prompt requires "document any assumptions made" (e.g., "System" for payments; no picks=not delivered? None stated in output).
  - **Minor unclarities (-0.5)**: Same-timestamp events (e.g., 2024-01-03T10:00Z: 1002 pick then 1003 create) arbitrary order (not sorted secondarily); table renders well but long notes (e.g., "Fragile items, handle with care") fit but could truncate if strict Markdown.

- **Overall**: Nearly flawless structure/logic (90%+ correct), but missing events = core inaccuracy (not "comprehensive"; flawed for process mining of order 1003). Strict penalty yields 6.0 (solid but not "very high"/flawless).
