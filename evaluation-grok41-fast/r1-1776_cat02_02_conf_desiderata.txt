The provided answer is nearly flawless in its final conclusions. It precisely identifies normative violations exclusively in Case 2 (correctly listing the four key issues: ordering reversal, skipped mandatory Inform Applicant, prohibited Finalize after rejection, and invalid closure logic), while accurately clearing Cases 1 and 3 (delays are not normative violations). Desiderata analysis correctly flags missing Follow-up Calls across all cases (log shows none listed), Case 3's explicit timing failures (>24h Credit Check, >48h Inform), Case 1's isolated Follow-up miss (timings met), and Case 2's partial compliance (Credit Check timely despite chaos; no false claims on absent Inform). Clarifies desiderata as "suboptimal but permissible." Interpretations are logical, constraint-aligned justifications (e.g., bottlenecks, errors, resources) without speculation or excuses for norms. Structure is clear/tabular; explanations concise, accurate, free of inaccuracies/unclarities/flaws.
