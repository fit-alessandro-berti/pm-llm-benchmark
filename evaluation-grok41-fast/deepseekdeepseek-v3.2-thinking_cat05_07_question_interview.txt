The provided answer is a nearly flawless response to the prompt. It delivers a comprehensive, well-organized list of 17 targeted, open-ended questions that precisely align with the stated goals: uncovering missing details (e.g., Q1-2 on scope), decision criteria (Q3-5), roles/responsibilities/handoffs (Q6-8), timing/sequencing/dependencies (Q9-11), and exception handling (Q13-15), while extending logically to communication (Q12) and success measures (Q16-17) for deeper conceptual insight. Every question directly references or builds on specifics from the process description without introducing inaccuracies, assumptions, or off-topic elements. No requests for SQL or implementation details. Categorization enhances clarity without verbosity. Phrasing is professional, precise, and interviewer-appropriate, with zero logical flaws, unclarities, or redundancies.
