**8.7/10.0**

### Breakdown of Grading:
- **Accuracy (9.0/10)**: Excellent identification of lanes (Warehouse, Dispatching, Logistics), start/end nodes ("Ship Goods" to "Ship. Prepared"), key decisions (Special Handling?, Insurance check), loops (e.g., yes-path back to Package Goods + notify), and major steps (e.g., Clarify Shipping Method, Get 3 offers, Fill out Shipment Paperwork, Move to Pickup Zone). Minor issues: Slight sequence fuzziness (e.g., insurance check listed post-decision but integrated well; "Write Package Label" fits no-path but not fully sequenced later); imprecise labels like "Fill out Ship" (likely misread from "Ship Goods" or "Shipment Paperwork"); purpose slightly off (starts *at* shipping initiation, not "after").
- **Completeness (9.0/10)**: Covers purpose/type, all lanes, full sequential flow with branches, swimlanes/arrows/info nodes, and 48-hour reference. No major omissions; hits every visible element.
- **Clarity & Structure (8.5/10)**: Well-organized (bold sections, numbered steps, bullets for branches). Readable and comprehensive, with helpful offer for more detail. Minor deductions for wordy phrasing (e.g., "from the moment after a product ships goods") and small redundancies (insurance listed twice).
- **Insight & Polish (8.0/10)**: Good context (e.g., business process for hardware retailer shipping). Professional tone, but could quantify more precisely (e.g., exact arrow paths) or note assumptions from blurry image.

Solid, professional response—strong for most real-world eval scenarios. A 10 would need pixel-perfect label matches and flawless sequence diagramming.
