The provided answer is flawless: the SQL query precisely meets the requirements using a correct, efficient INNER JOIN with a grouped subquery and accurate HAVING clause (`COUNT(*) <= 6`), ensuring only events from qualifying cases (`case_id`s with 6 events total) are returned via `SELECT e.*`. It handles grouping/filtering perfectly, works in DuckDB (standard SQL), returns full events for valid cases, and excludes others entirely. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, inefficiencies, or flaws; the explanation is concise, accurate, and directly mirrors the logic. No deductions warranted even under hypercritical scrutiny.
