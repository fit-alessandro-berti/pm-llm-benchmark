**3.0**

### Critical Evaluation:
- **Major logical flaw (direct succession not enforced)**: The core requirement is to identify the *exact sequence in direct succession* with **no other events in between**. The self-joins only enforce loose temporal order (`timestamp <`), allowing arbitrary intervening events (e.g., Approve  Other  Create  Other  Confirm would match incorrectly). This violates the prompt explicitly ("no other event from the same case in between them"). Proper solution requires row numbering (e.g., `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)`) and joins on consecutive row numbers (`rn + 1`, `rn + 2`). This alone disqualifies as fundamentally incorrect.
- **Syntax error in DuckDB**: `DATEDIFF(day, ...)` is invalid. DuckDB requires `datediff('day', start, end)` (string unit, lowercase function name though case-insensitive). No quotes on `day` causes parse failure. The hedging note ("syntax may vary... replace if different") admits uncertainty despite DuckDB specificity, worsening the issue.
- **Unnecessary columns**: Selects `activity1/2/3` in CTE but never uses them; clutter without value.
- **Incomplete handling of multiples/ties**: Ignores potential duplicate timestamps (row_number handles arbitrarily but joins don't check uniqueness); could over-match sequences.
- **Minor positives (not enough to offset)**: CTE structure for identification  filtering  exclusion is conceptually sound. Final exclusion via `NOT IN` and ordering are correct (though ordering unrequired). Explanation is clear but falsely claims "direct succession" enforcement via order alone.
- **Overall**: Attempts right high-level flow (+2 pts) but core logic/syntax broken (-7 pts). Hypercritical lens demands near-perfection; this fails on primary criteria. Equivalent to solving a different, easier problem.
