### Reasoning for Grade
The SQL query itself is **correct, efficient, and precisely fulfills the requirements**:
- Subquery accurately identifies `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`.
- Outer query correctly filters `event_log` to return all columns (`*`) for qualifying cases.
- Works in DuckDB (standard SQL), handles grouping/filtering as specified, and returns the full set of events for valid cases.
- `ORDER BY` is unnecessary but harmless (noted as optional) and improves readability without altering results.

However, under **utmost strictness and hypercritical evaluation**, significant deductions for **inaccuracies and unclarities in the accompanying text** (which is part of the submitted "answer"):
- **Major logical flaw in explanation**: Point 1 states "retains only those case IDs whose event count **is 6**" – this misdescribes the `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` condition. It incorrectly implies *exactly* 6 events, not "six or fewer" as required. This introduces confusion and could mislead readers into thinking the query excludes cases with <6 events.
- **Inaccurate comment**: Top comment reads "-- Return events only from cases that have **6 events**" (implying exactly 6, not 6; also has extraneous double space: "have  6").
- **Minor issues compounding deduction**: Intro correctly says "six or fewer," but internal inconsistencies (comment/explanation contradict it). `ORDER BY` is unrequested (though optional), adding unneeded complexity.

These are not "nitpicks" – they are **documented inaccuracies** in describing the query's logic, violating "nearly flawless" for a 9+ score. Query perfection merits baseline ~9.5, but textual flaws deduct 1.5 (per "even minor issues significantly lower"; multiple here amplify). Equivalent window function query could be more efficient (single pass), but subquery is acceptable. Overall: strong but flawed submission.
