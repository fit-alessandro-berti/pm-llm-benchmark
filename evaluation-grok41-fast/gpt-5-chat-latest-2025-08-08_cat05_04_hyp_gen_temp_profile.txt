**8.2**

### Rationale for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Base Score):**
  - **Structure and Coverage (9.5/10):** Perfectly mirrors the 3 tasks with clear sections/tables. Identifies exactly the 4 key anomalies (R-P low STDEV, P-N long/high var, A-C short, E-N instant) with accurate calcs (e.g., 90000s=25h, 604800s=7d) and insightful observations. Hypotheses are plausible, specific, and tied to each anomaly (e.g., batch jobs, backlogs). Queries target each anomaly directly, use Postgres-specific `FILTER`/`MIN` correctly for first timestamps, include relevant joins (claims), and have clear purposes. Overall independent presentation after intro.
  - **SQL Technical Quality (8.5/10):** Syntax valid in Postgres. Epoch extracts precise (hours/mins/days). HAVING for activity presence in (a) smart. Correlated subquery in (b) for adjuster works. Filters/thresholds reasonable (e.g., >5d, <3h, <=10m). Orders by diff for inspection.

- **Flaws Deducting Points (Strict Penalties):**
  - **References Instructions (Major Violation, -1.0):** Opening "Got it — I’ll present... without referencing the instructions" directly meta-references the prompt, breaking "Do not reference... Present independently." Not seamless start.
  - **SQL Inaccuracies/Assumptions (-0.8 total):**
    - (b): `resource::INT` risky—`resource` is VARCHAR (could be name like "John Doe", causing cast error); schema doesn't confirm numeric format. Adjuster link via 'A' resource LIMIT 1 ignores multiples/no 'A'.
    - (c): Purpose claims "without evaluation or approval events," but query lacks check (e.g., `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) FILTER (WHERE activity IN ('E','P')) = 0`). Only times quick A-C; intermediates could fit in 2h. Fails to verify skipping hypothesis.
  - **Unclarities/Logical Gaps (-0.4):** (a) orders ASC (shows fast approvals, but low STDEV needs variance stats like STDDEV). No aggregation for "tight band." (c)/(d) lack `claim_type` grouping despite prompt suggestion. Interactive ending ("Would you like...?") adds unsolicited engagement.
  - **Minor Polish (-0.1):** Table formatting quirks (e.g., "**R  P**" extra space). "~25 hrs" imprecise (exactly 25h). No query for STDEV calc/validation despite anomaly focus.

Nearly flawless in substance (90th percentile), but strict policy demands deductions for violations/incompletenesses—prevents 9+. Fixes would yield 9.8+.
