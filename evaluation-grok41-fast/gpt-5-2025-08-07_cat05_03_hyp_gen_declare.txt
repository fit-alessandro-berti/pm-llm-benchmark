9.8

### Explanation of Grading (Strict Evaluation)
**Strengths (Justifying High Score):**
- **Anomalies Identification (Near Perfect):** Exhaustively lists key contradictions (e.g., noncoexistence(E,C) + existence(C) bans E entirely—core insight spot-on), undermined logic (RC allowed, missing existence/ordering for A/E/P/N, no "C last"/single C), weaknesses (responded_existence moot/weak, precedence redundant), and undesired paths (E before A permitted). Fully aligns with intended flow violations. No logical flaws; hyper-precise on business impact.
- **Hypotheses (Flawless):** Directly mirrors prompt examples (misinterpretation/encoding errors, incremental policy changes, data/technical issues, throughput pressure). Adds plausible extensions (e.g., event semantics) without speculation. Independent and insightful.
- **Verification Approaches (Exceptional):** SQL queries are PostgreSQL-idiomatic (FILTER aggregates, row_number, regex substring, joins across all tables), directly target anomalies (e.g., #5/#6 for E/C contradiction, #7/#8 for A/E), extend logically to full flow (#11), data quality (#1/#15), post-close (#4), and business rules (adjuster matching #12-14 using `additional_info`, `adjusters`, `claims`). Structured (A-G), self-contained, reveals model-data mismatches. Far exceeds "for instance" examples in depth/utility.

**Deductions (Hypercritical Minor Issues, -0.2 Total):**
- **Notation Inconsistency (-0.1):** Anomalies use sloppy symbols ("E  A", "Precedence(C, R)") vs. precise DECLARE terms; risks minor ambiguity (e.g., precedence dict {"C":["R"]} conventionally RC, but phrasing "Precedence(C, R)" could confuse direction despite correct explanation). Not wrong, but unpolished.
- **Over-Extension (-0.1):** SQL #12-14/F assume undocumented `additional_info` formats (e.g., exact regex 'assigned_adjuster_id=(\d+)') and resource=name matching—plausible from schema but speculative; #14 hardcodes claim_type/specialization pairs without generality. Enriches but slightly drifts from pure anomaly checks.
- No inaccuracies (all SQL runnable/valid), unclarities (clear sections), or flaws (logic airtight). No policy/hint leakage. Response independent/self-contained.

Nearly flawless; 10 reserved for zero nitpicks.
