The provided answer is flawless: fully correct, precise, efficient, and idiomatic for DuckDB. The primary `QUALIFY`-based query accurately achieves the exact requirements—filtering cases with >6 events while returning all columns (`*`) for qualifying cases (`<=6` events per `case_id`)—using a single, optimized pass with window functions. No subquery/CTE bloat, and DuckDB's `QUALIFY` support is correctly leveraged for conciseness and performance equivalence/superiority to alternatives in practice.

- **Accuracy**: Window `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)` correctly computes per-case totals; `QUALIFY <= 6` filters post-window without errors or edge-case failures (e.g., handles empty table, single-event cases, exact 6-event cases perfectly).
- **Completeness**: Selects all columns; preserves full events for valid cases only.
- **Efficiency/Idiomaticity**: `QUALIFY` *is* the most efficient/readable DuckDB idiom for this (avoids redundant scans/CTEs; optimized internally like grouped aggregates).
- **Explanation**: Crystal-clear, step-by-step, no ambiguities; correctly notes DuckDB-specific feature.
- **Bonus**: Provides portable standard-SQL alternative (also correct, using `GROUP BY`/`HAVING`/ `IN`), enhancing value without detracting.

Zero inaccuracies, unclarities, flaws, or even minor nits (e.g., no unnecessary `ORDER BY`; no assumptions about data/indexes; precise phrasing matches prompt's "six or fewer"/"> six"). This is a model response.
