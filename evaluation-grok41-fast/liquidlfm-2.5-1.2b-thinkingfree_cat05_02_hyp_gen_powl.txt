**4.0**

### Justification (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies (8/10):** Accurately identifies the three key issues (loop on E-P, XOR skip on N, partial order enabling premature C via AC edge). Minor unclarity in describing partial order as "directly connecting loop XOR C" (no such explicit edges exist; it's the missing strictness + AC that allows concurrency/prematurity), but essence is correct. No logical flaws.
- **Hypotheses (6/10):** Covers prompt examples (business rule changes, miscommunication, technical errors) but vaguely/phrased poorly (e.g., "Loop Dynamic Adjustment" is handwavy; "Looper-Specific Bugs" repeats "loop" without tying to partial order). Lacks specificity or depth; feels generic/repetitive.
- **Verification Queries (1/10):** Catastrophically flawed – **not usable SQL**. All three queries have:
  | Issue | Examples Across Queries |
  |-------|-------------------------|
  | **Invalid syntax** | Commas instead of AND (`WHERE ... , P.ATRESULT`); ungrouped aggregates without proper GROUP BY; malformed subqueries (`ec.event_id = 'xor_complex'`). |
  | **Non-existent columns/tables** | `E.TIMESTAMP` (no alias), `P.ATRESULT`, `NG(note_address)`, `N.LINKED_COMPOUNDANCE`, `N.new_line_count`, `C.cloud_name`, `p.Country`, `C.review_time`, `e.from_customer_id`, `e.type`. Schema has no such fields (e.g., real: `activity`, `timestamp`, `claim_id`). |
  | **No sequence logic** | Fails to check per-claim event ordering (e.g., no `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp)` or `LAG/LEAD` for sequences like C before E/P/N; no `COUNT(activity='P') > 1` for loops; no `NOT EXISTS (activity='N') AFTER activity='P'`). |
  | **Irrelevant joins/conditions** | Pointless `adjusters` links (e.g., no `adjuster_id` in `claims`/`claim_events`); invented placeholders like `'xor_complex'`, `skip = TRUE`. Doesn't target prompt examples (e.g., closed w/o E/P, multiple P, skipped N frequency).
  | **Unclear descriptions** | Comments contradict code (e.g., Query A claims to check P w/o prior N, but queries E timestamp + unrelated adjusters).

  These aren't "database queries against the tables" – they're fabricated gibberish that wouldn't execute, failing to "verify these hypotheses" or "look for actual occurrences." Zero practical value.

**Overall:** Strong start ruined by verification (core task: 1/3 weight, but disqualifying). No self-correction; "final conclusions" include broken queries as "rigorous." Penalized heavily per instructions (strictness for inaccuracies/logical flaws).
