**9.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Correctness of logic and filtering (strong)**: Both queries accurately identify cases with 6 events via `GROUP BY ... HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` (first) and `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)` (second), then retain only those events. This precisely matches "exclude cases >6 events, return full events for 6". No logical flaws in grouping/filtering; handles all cases correctly (including edge cases like 0-6 events per `case_id`).
- **Output fidelity (minor deduction -0.4)**: First query is flawless (`SELECT e.*` returns **exactly** the original event columns). Second adds `n_events` column, altering schema/output to include extraneous data. Task specifies "the full set of events" (implying original rows/events only, no extras). In a benchmark, this would fail schema/output matching.
- **Equivalence claim (minor deduction -0.3)**: Calls second an "equivalent window-function alternative", but outputs differ (schema + extra column). Inaccurate labeling; they are *functionally* similar for filtering but not output-equivalent. Hypercritical: this is a clarity/logical imprecision.
- **Completeness and efficiency (excellent)**: Both are efficient (single table scan each), standard SQL (DuckDB-compatible), use proper aliases/joins (`USING` is clean/valid). Covers "at least" columns implicitly via `e.*`/`e.*`.
- **Extras like ORDER BY (neutral/positive)**: Unrequired but sensible (`ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` aids event log readability). No penalty, as it doesn't harm.
- **Style/clarity/presentation (strong)**: Concise, explains approach, provides two idiomatic methods (subquery JOIN vs. window). No syntax errors, ambiguities, or unnecessary complexity. Minor nit: prompt asks for "a" query (singular), but two is helpful/acceptable.
- **Strictness justification**: Nearly flawless (first query = 10.0 alone), but extra column + "equivalent" inaccuracy = minor issues warranting ~0.8 total deduction per "significantly lower for minor issues". No criminal/overreach concerns. Overall: production-ready, benchmark A-grade minus schema nit.
