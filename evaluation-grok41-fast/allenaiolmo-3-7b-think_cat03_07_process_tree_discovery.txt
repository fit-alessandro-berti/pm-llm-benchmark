**3.0**

The final model is semantically invalid for the event log (zero fitness for case 2, as RMI is mandatory post-AE but skipped there; mismatches case 1's RMIVFAD and case 3's RMIRMIVFAD, generating e.g. RMIVFRMIAD instead). LOOP(* (RMI, VF)) forces at least one RMI and interleaves VF incorrectly per operator semantics (A  (B  A)* yields alternating RMI-VF-RMI-..., not observed repetitions of consecutive RMIs). Structure ignores RMI's full optionality post-AE. Code is non-executable per spec (incorrect parents on leaves like `vf.parent=ra`; LOOP `children=[loop_a, loop_b]` but example implies LOOP takes ordered A/B children with explicit semantics; incomplete appends violate tree integrity). Description claims perfect fit but traces don't replay log. Fails fitness/precision balance; overly simplistic yet incorrect.
