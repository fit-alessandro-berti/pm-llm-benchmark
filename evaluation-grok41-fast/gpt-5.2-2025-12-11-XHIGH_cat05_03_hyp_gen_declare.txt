**10.0**

The response is exemplary: precise, comprehensive, logically airtight, and directly aligned with the prompt's requirements without extraneous content or hints. Anomalies are exhaustively identified with clear explanations of conflicts (e.g., E impossibility via existence(C) + noncoexistence(E,C); vacuity/shortcuts/redundancy/weak ordering), undermining intended flow (skipping A/E/P/N). Hypotheses are diverse, plausible, and grounded (covering data/logic errors, variants, overfitting, operations). SQL is PostgreSQL-correct, targeted (directly verifies each anomaly + extras like ordering/resources/variants), efficient (uses FILTER, window functions, EXISTS properly), and insightful (e.g., recency for cutoffs, pure-trace detection, claim-type pivots). No inaccuracies, ambiguities, redundancies, or flaws; exceeds "nearly flawless."
