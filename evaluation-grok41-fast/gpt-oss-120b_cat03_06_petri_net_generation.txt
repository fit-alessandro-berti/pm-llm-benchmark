**9.0**

The code correctly constructs a valid accepting Petri net using the required pm4py components, with proper imports, place/transition creation, arc connections via `petri_utils`, and defined `im`/`fm`. The model accurately captures the described linear sequence (CR  DV  FC  CA  AP  P  N  CL), initial token in `p_start` for a new claim, final token in `p_closed` for closure, and the specified loops: DV  RDS (via choice at `p_dv`  `t_rds`/`t_fc`, loop `p_dv`  `t_rds`  `p_rds`  `t_dv`) allowing multiple re-submissions, and FC  II (analogously at `p_fc`). Nondeterministic choices at split places appropriately model "in some cases" without guards. All scenario activities have labeled transitions. The net is sound (reachable final marking) and matches the example style (source/sink places).

Deductions (-1.0 total): 
- Minor encoding artifacts (â€‘ in labels/comments instead of '-'; sloppy but functionally irrelevant, labels still descriptive/unique).
- Unnecessary redundancy (`p_cl` + `t_end="End"` post-CL; direct `t_cl`  `p_closed` would suffice/minimalize, adds non-scenario transition).
- No explicit transition for "Insurance Claim (C)" (implicit in start; acceptable but unclarified).
- AP modeled as mandatory (no post-CA split/skip to P); scenario implies conditional ("if surpasses threshold"), though unmentioned as "loop" like RDS/II—strictly incomplete but minor given linear listing.

Nearly flawless execution; core logic/scenario fidelity excellent.
