**9.7**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Score)**:
  - **Completeness and Coverage**: All 12 low-level events per case are perfectly grouped without omission, overlap, or misattribution. Both cases (A1, B2) are implicitly handled via identical patterns, fulfilling "infer rules for grouping."
  - **High-Level Steps Identification**: 4 coherent, logical steps (Material Preparation, Assembly Operations, Post-Processing, Quality Inspection) represent distinct manufacturing phases. Groupings based on temporal proximity, logical dependency, resource patterns, and functional goals – directly matches prompt criteria (e.g., "temporally close, same resource type, logically follow").
  - **Justifications**: Exceptionally thorough and criteria-driven (e.g., temporal boundaries with approx durations, functional coherence, resource collaboration, inline vs. final QA distinction for weld measure). Explains *why* weld integrity stays in Assembly (immediate feedback, not separate phase) – insightful and defensible.
  - **Naming**: Domain-relevant, intuitive names (e.g., "Assembly Operations" over generic "Assembly"; "Post-Processing" captures finishing).
  - **Structure/Format**: Exceeds requirements with clear sections, lists, temporal bounds, ASCII visualization (accurate mapping), tables (durations, resources), consistency metrics – makes workflow "at a glance" as per goal.
  - **Extras**: Summary, recommendations add value without fluff; process insights (e.g., resource division, consistency) demonstrate deep understanding.
  - **Ignore <think>**: Followed – only final output graded; no penalty for early rationale tweaks.

- **Flaws (Strict Deductions, Preventing 10.0)**:
  - **Minor Inaccuracy (Timestamps)**: Temporal boundaries use blended/approx values across cases without per-case distinction (e.g., Material Prep lists "08:00:05 to 08:00:25" – A1 ends 08:00:20, B2 08:00:25; Assembly "08:01:22" is B2-specific). Labeled "approximately," but hyperstrictly imprecise for "exact time" log; could confuse if variances mattered. (-0.1)
  - **Minor Unclarity (Sentence Fragment)**: Material Prep rationale: "and preheating prepares the material for thermal." Incomplete/cutoff (missing "processing"?); disrupts flow despite obvious intent. (-0.1)
  - **Minor Overreach (Percentages)**: Duration table ~33%/37%/27%/3% on ~67s total is arithmetically off (actual: 30%/33%/30%/7%); "approximate" implied but not stated, trivial math flaw. (-0.1)
  - **Logical Nitpick**: Quality Inspection rationale calls it "two-layer quality verification" (inline weld + final visual) – accurate, but visualization/table treats weld measure as Assembly-only without cross-referencing QA layers explicitly. No flaw, but hypercritical: slightly under-emphasizes holistic QA flow. (-0.0, no deduction)

Nearly flawless (superior to most responses); deductions only for pixel-perfect strictness on tiny issues. 10.0 requires zero quibbles.
