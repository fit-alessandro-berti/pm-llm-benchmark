**9.5**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Correctness (flawless)**: The query precisely achieves the requirement. The CTE accurately computes `event_count` per `case_id` via `GROUP BY`. The `INNER JOIN` (default `JOIN`) correctly filters to only events (`SELECT e.*`) from cases where `event_count <= 6`, excluding >6-event cases entirely. All original columns and rows for qualifying cases are preserved. No logical flaws in grouping, filtering, or result set.
- **Efficiency and DuckDB compatibility (flawless)**: CTE avoids redundant scans (counts once), standard SQL fully supported in DuckDB. No performance issues.
- **Completeness (flawless)**: Handles "full set of events" perfectly; works with "at least" specified columns (e.g., `SELECT e.*` includes extras unharmed).
- **Clarity and explanation (near-flawless)**: Intro, step-by-step breakdown, and bullets are precise, educational, and directly tied to requirements. Matches "six or fewer" wording exactly.
- **Minor deduction (-0.5)**: Unrequested `ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp`. Prompt specifies *only* filtering/grouping for the result set—no ordering mandated. This adds an unasked clause (even if "for readability"), potentially altering execution plan or assuming timestamp sortability/indexing unnecessarily. Hypercritically, it's extraneous bloat in a "craft a ... query" task, violating "nearly flawless" by not being *exact* to spec. Remove it for 10.0. No other issues (e.g., no syntax errors, no wrong operators like `<` instead of `<=`, no LEFT JOIN pitfalls).
