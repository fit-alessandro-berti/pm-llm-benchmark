**9.5**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Correctness (flawless)**: Both queries are logically and syntactically perfect for DuckDB. The CTE+JOIN approach correctly uses `GROUP BY` + `HAVING` to filter case_ids with 6 events, then retrieves all events via `JOIN USING (case_id)`. The window function version is equally correct, efficient (single-pass), and preserves all columns. Both exclude cases >6 events and return full events for qualifying cases. No data loss, no extras, handles grouping/filtering precisely as required.
- **Completeness**: Returns `e.*` / `*` (all columns), matches "full set of events." No order specified in prompt, so unordered output fine. Works for given schema (and beyond).
- **Clarity/Explanation**: Numbered steps accurate and concise. Notes equivalence and single-pass efficiency—helpful bonus.
- **DuckDB Compliance**: Standard SQL features fully supported; no issues.
- **Minor Flaws (deducting 0.5)**: 
  - Typo/grammatical error in first query's comment: "-- Keep every event for cases whose total length  6" (double space, missing "<= ", incomplete phrasing). This is sloppy/un-clear, potentially confusing skimmers despite correct code/HAVING.
  - Provides *two* queries when prompt asks for "*a* DuckDB SQL query" (singular)—technically extras, though beneficial.
- **Why Not 10.0?** Per instructions, *even minor issues* (typo/unclarity) warrant *significant* deduction. This is nearly flawless but not pristine.
- **Why Not Lower?** Core solution impeccable; flaws cosmetic/non-functional. Hypercritical but not punitive for excellence.
