**2.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Answer Only):
- **Structural Compliance**: Core dictionary keys are present, and most values are sets of tuples (correct per prompt). `activ_freq` correctly maps all 10 activities to `{1}` (reasonable inference for mandatory once-per-case steps). However, `always_after: {}` uses a dict instead of `set()`—direct violation of "sets containing pairs". `never_together: {('D', 'RP"')}` has a syntax error (unclosed/malformed quote in `'RP"'`, invalid Python tuple)—renders it non-executable.
- **Constraint Accuracy & Completeness**:
  - `equivalence: set()`: Acceptable (no obvious equivalents in scenario).
  - `always_before`: Incomplete/inconsistent. Captures mid-sequence (CARI...GSLD) but arbitrarily omits ROCA and DICRP (scenario implies full sequence ROCARIPIQCPOGSLDICRP). Explanation claims "Dispatch before Invoice Customer" but pair `('D', 'IC')` absent—logical flaw.
  - `always_after`: Empty/wrong type. Scenario implies reverses (e.g., RI always after CA), but nothing populated; type error compounds failure.
  - `never_together`: Illogical. "Cannot co-exist inside the same case" means both cannot occur at all per trace, but D and RP *must* both occur in every order fulfillment case (per scenario sequence). Explanation misstates as "not concurrent" (wrong per definition: co-existence, not timing). Syntax error seals invalidity.
  - `directly_follows`: Mostly logical (full sequence RO...RP), but overreaches without evidence for exact direct succession (e.g., could QCPO have intermediates?); inconsistency with truncated `always_before`.
- **Clarity & Logical Flaws**: Explanation has unclarities (e.g., "Always After: No cases... without explicit order"—vague, ignores implications; "Generate Label  Dispatch  Invoice Customer" mismatches actual `always_before`). Inferences are speculative but unevenly applied. No transitivity or comprehensiveness (e.g., RO always before everything missing).
- **Overall**: Multiple fatal issues (syntax, type error, illogic, incompleteness) prevent "nearly flawless." Functional Python dict ~70% there, but strictness demands perfection for high scores—demerits compound to low grade.
