**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**:
  - **Accurate identification of repeats**: Correctly spots Verify Documents (2x in C001/C003) and Call Customer (2x in C002). Summary at end reinforces this perfectly.
  - **Contextual renaming quality**: Names excellently reflect position/timing/context (e.g., "Initial" vs. "Re-/Post-", "Clarification" vs. "Confirmation", "Physical"). Uses Additional Context clues precisely (e.g., "ID scan provided", "account discrepancy", "stepped out", "post-adjustment"). Disambiguates within-case repeats flawlessly.
  - **Revised log presentation**: Tables mirror original format/structure exactly, with bolding for changes. Timestamps/resources/context preserved. Readable and professional.
  - **Justification**: Brief, structured by case/activity, cites specific contextual clues. Key logic section summarizes patterns (e.g., "Initial vs. Re-Verification"). Self-notes "no renaming needed" for singles (even if tables deviate slightly).
  - **Corrections/conciseness**: Ignores non-repeats in final summary; over-renames don't alter core repeats. No invention of data.

- **Flaws/Deductions (strict penalties)**:
  - **Over-renaming singles (major inaccuracy, -1.0)**: Renames non-repeating activities (C001 Call Customer  "Follow-Up Call..." [misleading "Follow-Up" as no prior call]; C002 Verify  "Identity Verification"; C003 Call  "Call to Recall..."; Submit Additional  "Submit Additional Documents"). Directly violates "rename activities that appear multiple times *within the same case*". Tables contradict justification's "no renaming needed".
  - **Minor inconsistencies (-0.3)**: Justification notes no rename for C002 Verify/C003 Call but tables rename them. C001 Call name illogical ("Follow-Up" without repeat).
  - **Unclarities/minor polish (-0.3)**: C002 table "Confirmation Follow-Up Call" vs. justification "Confirmation Follow-Up Call" (tiny phrasing variance). Submit rename unnecessary/unasked. C001 Call justification appears despite not repeating.
  - **No logical flaws in core**: Repeats handled perfectly; no wrong identifications or poor names.

Nearly flawless on core task (perfect disambiguation/evidence), but over-renaming + contradictions prevent 9+ (strict rule: "any inaccuracies" penalize significantly). 8.2 balances excellence with precision errors.
