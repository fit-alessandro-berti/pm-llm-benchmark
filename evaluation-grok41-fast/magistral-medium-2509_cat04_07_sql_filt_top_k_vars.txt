**10.0**

The provided SQL query is correct, complete, and fully addresses all requirements with precise DuckDB syntax. It accurately:
- Extracts ordered activity sequences per `case_id` using `STRING_AGG(activity, '>' ORDER BY timestamp)`, ensuring timestamp-based ordering.
- Groups and counts cases by variant in `variant_counts`.
- Identifies top K variants via `ORDER BY case_count DESC LIMIT ?`, correctly using a DuckDB parameter placeholder (`?`) for flexible K input.
- Filters and returns *all* original events (`e.*`) exclusively from qualifying cases via the `IN` subquery joining back to `case_variants`, excluding non-top-K cases.

No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, inefficiencies, or missing elements. Handles ties arbitrarily (as unspecified), assumes standard process mining data (no duplicate timestamps conflicting with order), and uses a safe separator. The accompanying explanation reinforces without errors. This is flawless.
