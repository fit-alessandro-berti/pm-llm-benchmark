**9.8/10.0**

### Grading Rationale:
- **Accuracy (10/10)**: Perfectly captures the visualization's structure, elements (nodes, gray/red lines, three stages, time axis with exact dates), colors, and flow dynamics. No factual errors.
- **Completeness (10/10)**: Covers type, content, visual elements, and interpretation comprehensively, including volume (density), timing (line angles/lengths), and attrition.
- **Clarity & Structure (10/10)**: Well-organized with headings, bullet points, and a concise summary. Readable and professional.
- **Insightfulness (9.5/10)**: Strong analysis of progression, bottlenecks, and trends; minor deduction only because it could quantify patterns (e.g., peak densities) if data were pixel-countable, but that's beyond a pure description.
- **Overall Polish**: Engaging, offers next steps—feels like expert commentary. Near-perfect for the task.
