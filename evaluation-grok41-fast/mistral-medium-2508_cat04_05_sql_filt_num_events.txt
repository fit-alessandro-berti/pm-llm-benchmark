8.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (why not lower):**
- The primary query (first CTE + JOIN) is **flawless**: correctly groups by `case_id`, uses `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to filter cases precisely as required, joins back to retrieve *all* events (`e.*` handles any additional columns beyond the minimum specified), and includes sensible `ORDER BY` for readability (not required but enhances utility). It fully satisfies the task: identifies event counts per case, excludes >6, returns full events for 6.
- Window function query is *logically correct* for the core logic and a valid alternative; DuckDB optimizes window functions well.
- Clear structure, explanations, and bullet-point summary show understanding.
- No syntax errors; valid DuckDB SQL.

**Flaws (why not 10.0 or 9.5+; significant deductions for strictness):**
- **Inaccurate/ imprecise wording throughout (multiple instances, -1.0 total)**: 
  - Header: "Filter Cases with 6 Events" – omits "or fewer", misleading.
  - First query comment: "-- Return all events for cases with 6 events" – false; code does 6.
  - Second query comment: "-- Filter to only include rows from cases with 6 events" – same error.
  - These are logical inaccuracies that could confuse readers/test cases into thinking it's exactly 6, not 6. Minor phrasing but repeated = not "nearly flawless".
- **Second query incomplete/missing full event data (-1.0)**: Explicitly selects only `case_id, activity, timestamp`, ignoring "full set of events" and "at least these columns" (others exist). Comment says "-- Include any other columns here", but doesn't – query as written **fails the task** if extra columns present. Cannot claim "both queries will: ... 2. Return all events" – provably false.
- **Debatable/misleading efficiency claim (-0.3)**: "Window function approach might be more efficient as it only scans the table once." First query also scans once (single CTE on `event_log` + self-JOIN; DuckDB optimizer handles efficiently without extra scans if no materialization forced). Window may avoid join overhead but isn't guaranteed "more efficient"; unsubstantiated for strictness.
- **Unnecessary extras introduce risk (-0.2)**: Task asks for *a* query; providing two is fine but second drags down perfection. Bullet points assert "both" succeed identically, which they don't (columns issue).
- **Minor unclarities**: `ORDER BY` assumes `timestamp` sortable/uniquely orders events (fine, but original log order not guaranteed preserved if ties). No `LIMIT` or edge-case handling mentioned (e.g., empty table), but not required.

**Overall**: Primary query = 10.0. Explanation/alt = ~6.5. Averaged with strict weighting on completeness/accuracy = 8.5. Solid but not "nearly flawless" due to inaccuracies, incompleteness, and misleading claims – minor issues compound under hypercritical lens. Fix comments/second query  10.0.
