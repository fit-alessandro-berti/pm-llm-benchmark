**6.0**

### Explanation of Grading (Hypercritical Evaluation)
While the answer has a logical structure, covers the main violations in Case 2, distinguishes normative vs. desiderata appropriately, and provides interpretations, it contains **multiple significant flaws** that prevent a high score under hypercritical standards:

#### Major Inaccuracies (Severe Deductions):
1. **Missed Critical Normative Violation in Case 2**: The strict sequence **mandates** "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision" *regardless* of approval/rejection (per normative sequence: Decision  Inform  [branch]  Close). Case 2's log skips "Inform Applicant" entirely (Decision at 09:30  Finalize at 10:00  Close at 10:30). This is a clear **skipping violation**, equivalent in severity to the order reversal or post-rejection Finalize. The answer ignores it completely, falsely implying Case 2 only has "two serious violations." This is a **fundamental omission**, undermining Task 1.

2. **Factual Timestamp Error**: Claims "Risk Assessment at 08:20, followed by Credit Check at 08:20" — log clearly shows Credit Check at **09:00**. This misstates evidence, creating unclarity and eroding credibility on a core violation.

#### Notable Logical Flaws and Unjustified Claims (Significant Deductions):
3. **Fabricated Follow-up Call in Case 1**: Asserts Case 1 "includes the Follow-up Call (though not explicitly recorded... implicitly followed)." No log evidence supports this; Case 3 explicitly notes absence ("*(No Follow-up Call)*"), implying it's absent where unrecorded. This is an **unwarranted assumption**, violating Task 3's call for "interpretations... in line with the given constraints" (log-based). Case 1 likely *also* misses desiderata (no Follow-up), but answer wrongly clears it.

4. **Incomplete Desiderata Coverage**: Claims Case 1 and 2 "follow the recommended timing for Credit Check and Inform Applicant." Case 2 has **no Inform Applicant**, so timing is inapplicable/unassessable — sloppy. Case 1 timings are fine, but unmentioned Follow-up gap (as above) weakens this.

#### Minor Issues (Further Deductions):
5. **Lack of Precision on Desiderata Timing Calculations**: States Case 3 Inform is ">48 hours after... 2024-01-14 at 12:00" to "2024-01-16 at 15:00" — correct (~75 hours), but doesn't quantify (e.g., "approx. 3 days"), missing chance for rigor. Credit Check similarly vague.
6. **Unclarity in Summary**: "Case 2 has serious normative... Case 3 has minor desiderata" — accurate directionally but omits missed violation, understating Case 2's severity.
7. **No Justification for Case 1**: Task 3 requires "suggest interpretations... where possible"; answer skips Case 1 entirely (despite claiming it's perfect).

#### Strengths (Why Not Lower):
- Correctly flags Case 2's Risk-before-Credit and post-rejection Finalize.
- Case 1/3 normative compliance accurate.
- Distinguishes severity well ("serious violations" vs. "suboptimal").
- Provides plausible interpretations for Cases 2/3.

**Overall**: Competent but **not nearly flawless** — major miss on skipped mandatory step alone warrants ~40% deduction from 10.0. Equivalent to ~B-/C+ in strict academic grading.
