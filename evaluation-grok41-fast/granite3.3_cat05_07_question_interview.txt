**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
This answer is strong in structure (numbered list of 11 open-ended, targeted questions), coverage (addresses decision criteria [Q1,3,6], roles/responsibilities [Q2,4,8,9], sequencing/timing [Q9], exceptions [Q5,10], missing details/communication [Q11], and process flow), and relevance to the described process. The summary sentence reinforces alignment with goals without adding fluff. Questions are conceptual in intent and avoid SQL entirely.

However, under utmost strictness, multiple logical flaws and direct violations of the prompt's core rule ("should not request... implementation details") prevent a higher score:
- **Q2**: "Specific fields or categories... who has access" probes data schema and permissions—clear implementation details, not pure conceptual understanding (e.g., conceptual would be "how details inform later steps").
- **Q6**: "Specific tools or algorithms used for market analysis"—explicitly implementation-focused (tools/algorithms), violating the ban.
- **Q11**: "Specific tools or systems employed"—directly requests implementation details on tracking tech, despite the description already naming examples (CRMs, project tools); conceptual would ask "how tracking ensures audit trails" without "specific."
These are not minor (3/11 questions ~27% tainted); they introduce inaccuracies by crossing into forbidden territory, undermining the prompt's "conceptual understanding only" mandate. Minor unclarities include Q8's redundancy (rephrases description without deepening) and Q6's profitability angle slightly drifting from pure process clarification.

Flawless would have zero such slips (e.g., rephrase to "how does the team analyze markets conceptually?"). Deducted 2.8 points total (0.8-1.0 per violation) from a 10.0 base for "very good but flawed."
