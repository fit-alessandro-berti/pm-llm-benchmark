**9.0**

The provided SQL query is correct, efficient, and precisely meets the requirements: it accurately identifies `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then returns all events (`SELECT *`) from those cases using `WHERE case_id IN (...)`. This works perfectly in DuckDB (standard SQL semantics apply), preserves all columns including `activity` and `timestamp`, and handles edge cases like cases with 0, 1, or exactly 6 events.

The explanation is clear, accurate, and reinforces the logic without errors.

**Minor deduction (1.0 point)** for the example section, which contains inaccuracies:
- Claims cases 1 and 2 "each has exactly six events," but the table shows 3 events each.
- Output excludes case 3 (1 event, which satisfies `<= 6` and *should* be included), incorrectly stating it is "exclud[ed]" despite being "not relevant to the filtering condition."

These are factual errors and internal inconsistencies in the illustrative example, misrepresenting the query's behavior. However, they do not affect the query's correctness or the core response, which remains nearly flawless under strict evaluation. No other issues (e.g., syntax, logic, DuckDB compatibility, or completeness).
