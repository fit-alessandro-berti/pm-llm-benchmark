The answer precisely identifies the correct violating cases (2, 3, and 5) while implicitly confirming compliance for Cases 1 and 4. Explanations are accurate, directly tied to the normative description's constraints (e.g., sequencing of Authorize before Package, Package before Ship, no Ship after Cancel, path exclusivity for Authorize vs. Cancel), and resolve ambiguities logically without overinterpretation. No inaccuracies, unclarities, omissions, or logical flaws; structure perfectly matches the task.
