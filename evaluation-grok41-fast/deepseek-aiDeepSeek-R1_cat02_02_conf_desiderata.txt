**6.0**

The answer is structured well and correctly identifies the two explicit normative violations in Case 2 (out-of-order activities and forbidden finalization after rejection), correctly clears Cases 1 and 3 of normative issues, accurately computes timings for Case 3 desiderata (~49h and ~51h), and appropriately treats missing Follow-up Calls as desiderata failures across all cases (consistent with log absence, especially explicit for Case 3). Justifications are plausible and on-topic.

However, under utmost strictness, it has critical flaws warranting a significantly lowered score:
- **Major inaccuracy in normative violations (Case 2):** Completely misses that "Inform Applicant" is absent entirely after Loan Decision, violating the strict sequence ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed"; "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision"; no skipping allowed). This is a clear, obvious third violation (skipping a mandatory step), as egregious as the two identified. Explanation of reasons is materially incomplete.
- **Logical flaw in desiderata (Case 2):** Fails to note that absence of "Inform Applicant" also violates the prompt notification desideratum ("applicant is informed promptly... within 48 hours of the loan decision"), as no notification occurred at all. Listing only Follow-up Call ignores this.
- **Minor unclarities:** Desiderata section implies Case 2 timings are neutral (only lists Follow-up), without addressing the non-performance of Inform timing; justifications for Case 2 do not cover the skipped Inform.

These are not minor (especially the normative skip, central to "Key Normative Constraints" and "What is Not Allowed"); the answer is strong but not "nearly flawless," precluding 9-10. A perfect response would list three normative violations for Case 2, address Inform in desiderata, and have zero gaps.
