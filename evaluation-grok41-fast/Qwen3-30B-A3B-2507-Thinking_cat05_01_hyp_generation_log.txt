**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (supporting the score):**
- **Anomaly Identification (Strong, ~9/10)**: Accurately spots key deviations in cases 1002 (early Confirm Shipment/Ship Goods), 1003 (early Ship Goods, missing Validate Stock), and 1004 (early Receive Payment). Ties to normal flow logically. Minor phrasing issue: Case 1003 claims "Ship Goods before Validate Stock" despite absence (no timestamp comparison possible), but corrects via Query 5.
- **Hypotheses (Strong, ~9/10)**: Relevant and varied (system errors, overrides, data entry, training). Directly testable (e.g., role patterns via resources).
- **SQL Structure & Coverage (Adequate, ~7/10)**: Queries 1-3 are correct, efficient self-joins using timestamps, scalable (no hardcoded IDs), and target specific violations (catches 1002/1004 directly). Query 5 aptly handles missing steps (catches 1003). Purposes clearly explained, no hints. Uses `resources` as allowed.
- **Overall Completeness**: Covers sequence violations + missing steps + role investigation. "Why These Queries?" section shows insight.

**Flaws (major deductions for strictness):**
- **Broken SQL (Query 4, -1.5)**: Syntactically invalid/logically flawed. Innermost subquery `timestamp > (SELECT timestamp FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = order_event_log.case_id AND activity = 'Confirm Shipment')` causes self-reference ambiguity/error in PostgreSQL (unqualified `order_event_log.case_id`). Repeated in other OR clauses. Ambition good, but executable? No—fails on run.
- **Incomplete Violation Coverage (-0.8)**: Misses explicit queries for:
  - Confirm Shipment before Validate Stock (1002).
  - Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment (1003).
  Thought had them; final omits. Anomalies mention but queries don't fully probe.
- **SQL Polish Issues (-0.3)**: Queries 1-3/5 lack `DISTINCT` (duplicates if multiple matching events per case, though data avoids it). Query 5 returns *all rows* for anomalous cases (not just case_ids)—inefficient/misleading without aggregation.
- **Untapped Tables (-0.1)**: `orders` unused (e.g., correlate anomalies with `order_type='priority'` or high `order_value` for override hypothesis).
- **Minor Unclarities (-0.1)**: Case 1003 anomaly lists "before Validate Stock" inaccurately (missing, not out-of-order). No query for Issue Invoice before Confirm Shipment (1003).

**Final Calibration**: Excellent conceptual work elevates to 7+, but broken/incomplete SQL prevents 8+. Not "nearly flawless"—strictly, ~20% flawed.
