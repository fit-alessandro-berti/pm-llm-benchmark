**7.0**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies (Strong, ~9/10)**: Accurately identifies core contradiction (noncoexistence of E/C vs. intended sequence), weak precedence, missing order in responded_existence, and gaps in full flow enforcement. Logical, comprehensive, aligns with model vs. intended flow. Minor: Could explicitly note if responded_existence semantics imply *after* E (common in DECLARE), potentially worsening anomaly to reversed order.
- **Hypotheses (Excellent, ~10/10)**: Directly matches prompt examples (misinterpretation, policy changes, technical errors, operational pressures). Clear, plausible, business-relevant. Flawless.
- **SQL Verification (Weak, ~5/10)**: 
  - Queries 1-3: Precise and relevant (C before E; E+C coexistence; E without prior A). Good use of timestamps, NOT EXISTS, GROUP BY.
  - Queries 4-5: Major logical flaws—do not filter for *closed* claims (no `activity='C'` condition). Query 4 flags *all* claims without E (includes unfinished ones); query 5 flags claims lacking *both* P *and* N (odd logic for "missing mandatory"). Ignores `adjusters` table entirely, despite prompt mandating queries "on the `claims`, `adjusters`, and `claim_events` tables" and example ("evaluation... correspond with assigned adjusters"—e.g., no JOIN on `resource`/`adjuster_id`, specialization matching `claim_type`).
  - Overall: Incomplete coverage, doesn't fully verify anomalies in practice (e.g., no adjuster assignment validation). Duplicates possible in query 1 (no DISTINCT).
- **Overall Structure/Clarity (Good, ~9/10)**: Clean sections, independent presentation, no prompt hints leaked. Markdown aids readability.
- **Strict Penalty**: SQL inaccuracies/uncompleteness (missing table, flawed "closed" logic) are significant logical flaws, not minor—drops score despite strong first two tasks. Nearly flawless would require perfect, comprehensive SQL using all tables.
