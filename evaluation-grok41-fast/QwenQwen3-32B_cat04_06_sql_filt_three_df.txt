The provided answer is nearly flawless. The SQL query precisely meets all requirements:

- Correctly identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence using `ROW_NUMBER()` and joins on `rn + 1`/`rn + 2`, ensuring no intervening events.
- Accurately filters for time >5 days between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' using `(EPOCH(o3.timestamp) - EPOCH(o2.timestamp)) / 86400.0 > 5`, which is a valid, precise DuckDB idiom for elapsed days (DuckDB's `EPOCH()` returns Unix epoch seconds).
- Excludes **all events** from matching cases via `NOT IN (DISTINCT case_id)`, returning only events from non-matching cases.
- Uses CTE for clarity and efficiency.
- `SELECT el.*` preserves all original columns/events.
- Added `ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp` provides "proper ordering" as prompted, ensuring a logical, reproducible result set without assuming database defaults.

Explanation is concise, accurate, and addresses key aspects (sequence enforcement, timing, exclusion logic) with relevant edge cases (e.g., multiple sequences per case). No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical flaws; handles assumptions (e.g., timestamp ordering, no NULL `case_id`) robustly. Minor potential concerns like timestamp ties in `ROW_NUMBER()` or floating-point precision are negligible and unproblematic in practice for this context.
