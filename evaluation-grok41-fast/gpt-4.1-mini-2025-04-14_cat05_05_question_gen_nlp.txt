This response is flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It delivers exactly 20 open-ended, thought-provoking questions, each precisely aligned with the described process (e.g., suppliers' lead times/quality/geopolitics, assembly/automation, logistics/customs, digital/ML systems, inventory/JIT, compliance/recalls, R&D/collaboration, etc.). All focus sharply on insights, issues, strategies, and implications without overlap, redundancy, or deviation. Phrasing is clear, grammatical, professional, and engaging—no ambiguities, logical flaws, inaccuracies, or extraneous content. No SQL or other prohibited elements. Structure is a pure numbered list as required. No deductions warranted.
