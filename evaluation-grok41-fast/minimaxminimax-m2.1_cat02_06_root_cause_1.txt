**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless. It precisely calculates and lists all total resolution times with exact durations, correctly identifies Cases 102, 104, and 105 as the significantly delayed outliers (with appropriate benchmarking against 101 and 103), and accurately pinpoints root causes through detailed timeline breakdowns: escalations (in 102 and 105), long post-investigation waits (quantified exactly at 19h, 19h, and 43h), redundant investigations (specifically in 105), and late investigation starts (in 104). No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities exist—the analysis avoids speculation, sticks to log evidence, and differentiates cases appropriately (e.g., 104 lacks escalation). Recommendations are directly tied to causes, actionable (e.g., SLAs, streamline escalation to avoid redundancy, monitor idle time), and comprehensive without redundancy. Structure perfectly matches the task, with clear headings, bullet points, and quantified insights for maximum clarity.
