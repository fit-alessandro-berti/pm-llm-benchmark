**10.0**

This answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It fully meets all requirements: correct Case ID usage, logically derived and named activities matching prompt examples (with per-item granularity for picking and per-record for deliveries/invoices/payments, which is meaningful and superior to summarization), precise timestamp mapping with perfect chronological ordering within cases, comprehensive data integration via keys (orders  lines  deliveries  invoices  payments), and enrichment with resources (accurately mapped from Resources table, with reasonable "System" for payments lacking actor data as a "system entity"), plus valuable other attributes from all relevant tables (including optional Products). All events for all order_ids are included without invention (e.g., 1004 correctly truncated at picking), output is Markdown table, and assumptions (e.g., incompletes, multiples, mappings) are clearly documented. No inaccuracies, logical flaws, ambiguities, missing data, or chronological errors; even redundancies (e.g., repeated case attributes) enhance PM utility without violating specs. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., separate columns vs. lumped attributes, "Item Picked" singular) are optimal or neutral.
