**9.2**

The final conclusion (paragraph before boxed + boxed statement) correctly identifies **Group B's log** as exhibiting the bias, accurately attributes it to **ScoreAdjustment (+10 Community Boost)** tied to **CommunityGroup** (present only in qualifying Group B cases), links it properly to **LocalResident=TRUE** (exclusive to Group B), and explains manifestation as favoritism toward locals with community ties, leading to approvals for lower preliminary scores (e.g., U003 at 695705 Approved vs. implied rejection in Group A at similar/710). This captures systematic differences in decisions (boost enables outcomes unavailable to Group A). 

Hypercritical deductions (-0.8 total): 
- Minor imprecision in "favoring local residents" (true for Group B overall trend, but strictly only subset with CommunityGroup; U002 local/TRUE but Noneno boost/rejected like Group A). 
- Soft "potentially disadvantaging" understates clear systematic disadvantage to protected Group A (no access to boost). 
- No explicit discussion of implied threshold inconsistency (705 Approved in B vs. 710 Rejected in both groups), though conclusion doesn't hinge on it and examples support inference. 
Nearly flawless; minor phrasing/logic gaps prevent 10.
