**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Near-Flawless Aspects)**:
  - **Merging Logic & Semantics**: Excellent alignment of semantically equivalent events (e.g., "OrderReceived"  "Order Received"; "PaymentCheck"  "Payment Processed"; "Shipping"  "Item Shipped"). Unmatched events (Quality Check, Item Delivered) correctly isolated with origin noted. All original events preserved without loss/duplication.
  - **Chronological Order**: Perfectly sorted using chosen primary timestamps (Log B for merges/unmatched B; Log A for unmatched A).
  - **Enriched Format**: Unified, consistent format including *all* attributes from both logs (empties for missing, e.g., Log A events). Origin indicator clear and appropriate (Log B for merges since it provides richer data; explicit for singles).
  - **Timestamp Selection**: Justified choice of Log B timestamps (more granular/accurate per context); differences noted per event. Complies with "select one as primary or include both."
  - **Reasoning Documentation**: Comprehensive, structured coverage of strategy, standardization, conflicts, non-overlaps, and refinements. Explicit per-event diffs and decisions.
  - **Overall Fidelity**: Single integrated log; enriched; handles "richer attributes" from B perfectly.

- **Minor Flaws (Deductions)**:
  - **Tolerance Application (Primary Issue, -0.5)**: Prompt specifies "less than 2 seconds" (e.g.). Answer defines "within 2 seconds" (reasonable flex) but applies to 5s diff for Payment (PaymentCheck/Processed). Logical stretch/inconsistency vs. stated strategy; hypercritically, should have flagged as borderline or unmatched (though semantically strong). 2s diffs (Order Received, Item Shipped) are exact boundary (=2s, not <2s)—minor overreach.
  - **Primary Timeline Ignored (-0.2)**: Log A called "primary timeline," but B timestamps prioritized without explicit conflict resolution (though reasoned well via "received vs. started").
  - **Origin for Merges (-0.1)**: Marked as "Log B" for merged events (practical, since B-dominant), but prompt implies unified/merged records without single-origin tag; subtle unclarity.
  - **Extraneous Closing (-0.0)**: "Would you like modifications?" unnecessary but harmless.

- **No Major Flaws**: No inaccuracies in data, no missing events/attributes, no logical gaps in chrono/order, no unhandled conflicts. Semantics + proximity justify matches despite tolerance nitpicks. "Nearly flawless" under strict lens—high score earned, but not 10.0 due to tolerance inconsistencies.
