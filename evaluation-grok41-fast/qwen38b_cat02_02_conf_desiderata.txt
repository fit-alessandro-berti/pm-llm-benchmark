**7.0**

The answer is well-structured, comprehensive in format, and correctly identifies the two log-highlighted normative violations in Case 2 (ordering reversal and post-rejection finalization), while accurately assessing Case 1 as fully compliant and Case 3 as normatively sound. Desiderata analysis is precise on timings (correct calculations for Case 3 delays) and appropriately qualifies them as suboptimal without overstating severity, with good clarification on follow-up calls. Interpretations are reasonable and on-task. Summary is clear.

However, under utmost strictness: 
- **Major inaccuracy/omission**: Fails to identify the explicit skipping of the mandatory "Inform Applicant" step in Case 2 (no event after Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30 before Finalize Documentation/Close Case). This violates core normative rules ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed"; "no skipping activities"; required even for rejections per sequence). Reasons/explanations are thus incomplete (lists only 2 violations, misses this third critical one).
- **Minor inconsistency**: Treats absence of Follow-up Call as a desiderata failure/suboptimal only for Case 3, but Case 1 also lacks it (not logged, like others)—yet claims Case 1 "meets all desiderata." All cases arguably fail this recommended desideratum equally.
- No unclarities or logical flaws otherwise, but the skip omission alone prevents "nearly flawless" status, warranting significant deduction per instructions.
