**7.0**

### Explanation of Grade (for transparency, not part of response):
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: Excellent structure matching the task (sections 1-3 covered precisely). Correctly identifies Case 2 as the only normative violator and Case 1/3 as compliant. Accurately details the two listed normative violations in Case 2 with precise explanations and timestamps. Desiderata analysis is flawless: correct counts, timings (e.g., Case 3's ~49h Credit Check >24h, 51h Inform >48h), missing follow-ups across all cases, and clarifies non-severe nature. Justifications provided only where appropriate (Case 3 delays), sensible and in line ("when possible"). Summary table crisp and accurate to stated conclusions. No unclarities, logical flaws in listed points, or contradictions.
- **Weaknesses (why not higher)**: Critical inaccuracy/omission in Task 1: Case 2 skips the mandatory "Inform Applicant" entirely (log: Decision at 09:30  Finalize at 10:00  Close at 10:30; no Inform row). This is explicitly required ("must be informed"; sequence includes it post-Decision; "no skipping"). Listed as only "two ways" violates, omitting this third clear normative violation (skipping required step). Hypercritical standard treats this incompleteness as significant flaw, preventing "nearly flawless" (8+). Minor: Case 1 normative compliance implicit (not explicit like Case 3), but sufficient.
- **Overall**: Strong (~85% flawless), but omission of key violation drops from 9+. Strict deduction for inaccuracy in "explain the reasons."
