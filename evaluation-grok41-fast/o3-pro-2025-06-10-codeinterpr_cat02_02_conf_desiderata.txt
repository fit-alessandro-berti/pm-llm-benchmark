**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (Justifying High Score):**
- **Task Coverage (Complete and Accurate):** Fully addresses all 3 parts. Normative violations correctly identified (only Case 2; Case 1/3 compliant) with precise reasons (order violation, skipped Inform Applicant, forbidden Finalize post-reject). Desiderata correctly flagged (all cases miss Follow-up Call; Case 3 timings ~49h/51h violations; Case 1 timings compliant; Case 2 inform timing N/A due to skip but noted as desideratum fail). Clarifies desiderata as "minor"/"good-practice" vs. "hard errors" repeatedly, emphasizing suboptimal/not severe. Interpretations/justifications reasonable, constraint-aligned (e.g., data-entry error for Case 2 order, operational delays for Case 3).
- **Logical Precision:** No factual errors in log analysis (e.g., Case 2: Risk@08:20 before Credit@09:00; no Inform ever; Finalize post-Reject; timings calculated correctly). Distinguishes normative vs. desiderata perfectly. Summary/overall verdict concise and correct.
- **Structure and Clarity:** Well-organized sections matching task (1-3), with tables-like bullets. Explanations concise yet thorough.

**Deductions (Strict/Hypercritical - Total -0.8):**
- **Minor Unclarities/Formatting Flaws (-0.3):** Sequence in Case 1 normative: "(Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision...)" lacks arrows/operators (reads awkwardly as run-on). Double spaces in headers (e.g., "1.  NORMATIVE"). Slightly ambiguous phrasing like Case 1 desiderata "Minor deviations" header when only call fails (timings explicitly OK, but header implies more).
- **Inconsistency/Minor Polish Issues (-0.2):** "Finalise" (British spelling) vs. log "Finalize" (American); repeated in multiple places. Approximate timings "~49 h"/"~51 h" accurate but not exact (e.g., Case 3 credit: precisely 49h 1min; inform: 51h 15min) – hypercritical pedantry, but no error.
- **Extraneous Content (-0.3):** Section 4 ("ACTIONABLE TAKE-AWAYS") and "Overall verdict" not requested (task strictly 1-3). Adds value but deviates from instructions; ignores "identify... explain... clarify... suggest" boundaries. Hypercritical view: bloats response, risks diluting focus.

**Why Not 10.0?** Not "nearly flawless" due to avoidable presentation unclarities and unasked additions. Content is 100% accurate/logically sound – no inaccuracies or flaws there – but strict rubric demands perfection in form/clarity/adherence. 9.2 reflects excellence with tiny, fixable nits.
