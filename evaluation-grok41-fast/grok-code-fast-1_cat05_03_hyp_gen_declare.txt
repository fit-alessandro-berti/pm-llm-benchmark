**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies Identification (9.5/10)**: Nearly flawless. Correctly pinpoints the core contradiction (A  E via responded_existence + mandatory C via existence + E not_with C via noncoexistence, forbidding any trace with A alongside mandatory C). Accurately notes absence of constraints for full sequence (A, E, P, N), enabling skips like RC, and flags noncoexistence as overly restrictive vs. ideal E-before-C. Minor deduction for slightly overemphasizing "every trace must end with C" without noting it permits A-less traces (RC), though not a logical flaw.
  
- **Hypotheses Generation (10/10)**: Perfect match to prompt style and examples. Four clear, plausible, business-relevant hypotheses (misinterpretation, incremental changes, technical/data issues, speed pressure). Speculative yet grounded, no fluff or irrelevance.

- **Verification Approaches (6.5/10)**: Strong conceptually (targets key issues: coexistence, skips, implications), with 4/5 queries syntactically correct and relevant. However, significant flaws lower score harshly:
  | Query | Issue | Severity |
  |-------|--------|----------|
  | 1 (E+C coexist) | None; brings all events, correct. | None |
  | 2 (A+C no E) | **Critical bug**: `WHERE ce.activity IN ('A', 'C')` filters out E events pre-aggregation, so `SUM(E)=0` always true. Returns *all* A+C claims, not just no-E ones. Fundamentally broken. | Major (-2.5) |
  | 3 (C no E) | Correct LEFT JOIN + NULL check + EXISTS C. | None |
  | 4 (A no later E) | Correct; detects per-A violations via timestamp. Handles multiples well. | None |
  | 5 (C no prior P/N) | Mostly correct, but OR logic flags claims missing *either* (broad); JOIN on C assumes single C (multi-C duplicates results). Minor. | Minor (-0.5) |
  - **No use of `adjusters` table**: Prompt explicitly requires queries "on the `claims`, `adjusters`, *and* `claim_events` tables"; example demands "evaluation steps always correspond with assigned adjusters" (e.g., JOIN `claim_events.resource` ~ `adjusters.adjuster_id` + `specialization` matching `claim_type`). Suggestion only is insufficient—no actual query. Major omission (-1.0).
  - Explanations clear, but bugs/omissions undermine "check if anomalies occur in practice."

**Overall**: Excellent structure/content (flawless non-SQL parts), but SQL inaccuracies/omissions prevent "nearly flawless" (per instructions). Strict deduction for bugs (not "minor") and missing table/integration yields 8.2.
