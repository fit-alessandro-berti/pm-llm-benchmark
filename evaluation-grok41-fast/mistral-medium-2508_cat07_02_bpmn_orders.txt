**9.3**

### Rationale
- **Accuracy (9.5/10)**: Excellent capture of gateways, sequences, loops, and inter-departmental message flows (e.g., faulty materials loop, product notification back to Sales). Minor inaccuracies: start event is "customer order" (not "every Monday morning"); Procurement trigger is "material compensation" request (not "order details arrive").
- **Completeness (9.5/10)**: Covers all major pools (Sales, Production, Procurement, Warehouse), tasks, subprocesses, decisions, and connections. No major elements omitted.
- **Clarity & Structure (9.5/10)**: Well-organized by department with numbered steps, plus a dedicated "Connections" section and summary. Easy to follow and mirrors BPMN hierarchy.
- **Detail & Insight (9.0/10)**: Appropriate depth without overcomplication; effective summary adds value.

Overall, a strong, professional description—near-perfect but docked slightly for the two small factual slips visible in the diagram.
