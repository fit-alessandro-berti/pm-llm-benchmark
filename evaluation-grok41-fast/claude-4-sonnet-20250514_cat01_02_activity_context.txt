**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (justifying high base score)**:
  - **Complete task coverage**: Accurately identifies the two recurring activities ("Verify Documents" and "Call Customer") with correct per-case counts. Interprets contexts precisely based on position, preceding events, resources, and descriptions. Revised log fully presented in original format with only relevant renamings. Justification is structured, brief, and cites exact clues (temporal, sequential, contextual, resources, logic).
  - **Disambiguation excellence**: Renames make all instances unique and process-reflective (e.g., specific "Call for..." variants perfectly capture nuances; Initial vs. Re-verify distinguishes verification loops across cases consistently).
  - **No major logical flaws**: No missed recurrings (e.g., "Adjust Account" correctly untouched as it doesn't recur *within* a case). No inventions or alterations to non-recurring activities/timestamps/resources/contexts. Workflow logic inferred correctly (e.g., re-verify only after interventions).
  - **Clarity and presentation**: Markdown tables match original exactly. Analysis sections logical and comprehensive.

- **Minor issues deducting points (strict deductions for perfection)**:
  - **Naming awkwardness/inconsistency (0.4 deduction)**: "Initial Document Verify" is grammatically odd (verb-phrase structure feels incomplete/imperative; better as "Initial Documents Verification" or "Verify Initial Documents" to parallel original "Verify Documents"). Paralleled poorly with "Re-verify Documents".
  - **Singular/plural inaccuracy (0.3 deduction)**: "Document" (singular) in "Initial Document Verify" mismatches original "Documents" (plural) and all contexts ("identity documents", "docs", "ID scan"). "Re-verify Documents" uses plural correctly—intra-naming inconsistency undermines precision.
  - **Over-specification minor overreach (0.1 deduction)**: Renames single-occurrence "Verify Documents" in C002 to "Initial..." (unnecessary per task focus on *recurs within case*), though consistent and harmless—slight deviation from minimalism.

Nearly flawless (flawless = 10.0 would require pixel-perfect naming parallelism/grammar and zero extras). Deductions are minor but per instructions warrant ~0.8 total drop for strictness.
