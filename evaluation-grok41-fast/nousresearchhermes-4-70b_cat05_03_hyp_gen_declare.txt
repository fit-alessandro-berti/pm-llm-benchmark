**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies (8.5/10)**: Excellently identifies core contradiction (`responded_existence` forcing E after A, `noncoexistence` blocking E+C, clashing with `existence` for C and intended flow). Correctly notes missing P/N constraints and weak precedence. Minor deduction: Overstates A as "mandatory per business logic" (model lacks existence for A; intended flow implies it but model allows skipping, undermining claim of full impossibility without noting this nuance). No mention of `init` R potentially clashing if traces lack R first.
  
- **Hypotheses (9.0/10)**: Matches prompt examples closely (misinterpretation, incremental changes, data issues, pressure). Concise, plausible, directly tied to anomalies. Minor: "Data-driven anomalies" could specify "erroneous mining" more precisely, but strong.

- **SQL Verification (5.5/10)**: Covers key prompt instances (E/C coexistence, closed without E, E after assignment indirectly). Comprehensive scope (adjusters, sequences). **Major flaws penalize heavily**:
  | Query | Issues |
  |-------|--------|
  | a | Logic ok for Ano E; but OR "missing A" verifies *intended flow*, not model anomaly (model allows no A/no E). Syntax works but inefficient (nested EXISTS). Includes irrelevant `claim_type`. |
  | b | Flawless: Cleanly detects E+C coexistence. |
  | c | **Syntax error**: `LEFT JOIN ... ON cond1 OR cond2` fails (ambiguous; needs separate LEFT JOINs as in <think>). Casts unreliable (`::VARCHAR` redundant; `::INTEGER` crashes on non-numeric `resource`). Assumes both name/ID matching without schema evidence. |
  | d | Mostly sound (C without prior E), but cartesian risk (multi-C/multi-E); misses GROUP BY for claims. No timestamp tie to specific C instances properly. |
  | e | **Logically broken**: Counts *non*-P/N activities after E, HAVING <2 distinct such activities? Fails to verify P/N *existence* (e.g., if only P after E, filters to no rows, COUNT=0<2  flagged wrongly; ignores if P/N present but extras). No prior E guarantee per claim.

  Missing: Direct `existence` C violation (claims without C); `init` R (first event !=R); AE temporal order; adjuster specialization match; claims without R (precedence).

**Overall**: Strong conceptual grasp (anomalies/hypotheses ~near-perfect), but SQL inaccuracies/logic flaws (2/5 broken/incorrect) prevent high score. Comprehensive but not precise/executable. Strict penalty for "any inaccuracies" in core task.
