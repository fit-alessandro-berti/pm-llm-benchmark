**4.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Syntactically valid POWL code using correct classes (`StrictPartialOrder`, `OperatorPOWL`, `Transition`, `SilentTransition`). Accurately models sequential prefix (`OR  MS  QS  AS`), optional `LB` via `X(LB, skip)`, and **testing loop perfectly** (`*(TST, RT)` matches all variants: single TST, or TST  RT  TST*, always exiting after TST, never ending on RT). End sequence (`PK  label_choice  DP  D`) good. No invented concurrency (correct per logs). Structure uses partial order appropriately for chaining.
- **Major Inaccuracies/Logical Flaws (heavy deductions)**:
  - **IQC/AS modeling fundamentally broken**: `iqc_loop = *(IQC, AS)` mandates initial IQC after `AS`, followed by exit *only after IQC* (not after AS). Cannot generate log traces:
    | Case | Log suffix after initial AS | Model output possible? |
    |------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
    | 1    | IQC  AS  TST             | No (produces IQC  AS  IQC  TST or just IQC  TST). |
    | 3    | IQC  IQC  AS  IQC  AS  TST | No (cannot IQC  IQC; requires AS between IQCs). |
    | 4    | (directly)  TST            | No (mandates IQC at minimum). |
    | 5    | IQC  AS  IQC  AS  TST   | No (loop forces IQC after every AS). |
    POWL loop semantics ("A then exit or B  A") explicitly violated.
  - **Mandatory iqc_loop**: `AS  iqc_loop` forces IQC execution (LOOP starts with A1), but case 4 skips entirely. No XOR/skip for IQC/AS phase.
  - **No handling of complex IQC/AS interleaving**: Logs show arbitrary repeats (consecutive IQCs, AS  TST, IQC  AS  TST). Requires nested operators/PO or different loop (e.g., `*(AS, IQC)` or XOR-loop), but model simplistic/sequential only.
- **Unclarities/Inconsistencies (deductions)**:
  - Code `*(IQC, AS)` vs. explanation/visual "`*(AS, IQC)`" mismatch (typo? undermines trust).
  - Redundant `AS` (separate node + inside loop); unclear if intended as distinct instances.
  - Comment "# IQC  AS  IQC  ..." admits forced IQC-after-AS, contradicting logs.
  - Nodes list includes `AS` and `iqc_loop` (with AS), but no concurrency/PO flexibility for variants.
  - No silent transitions for IQC skip or other optionals beyond LB.
- **Overall**: Captures ~50% (prefix, test loop, LB, suffix) but fails core complexity (IQC/AS variants in 80% of cases). Cannot replay any full trace accurately. Logical flaws prevent "representing this complex process." Not "nearly flawless"—multiple fatal mismatches warrant low-mid score.
