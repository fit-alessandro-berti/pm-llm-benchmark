**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless. It precisely implements the requirements using consecutive row numbers to enforce direct succession (no intervening events), correctly filters for the exact activity sequence, accurately computes the time difference (>5 days via `INTERVAL 5 DAY`, matching DuckDB syntax and "more than 5 days"), identifies and excludes entire matching cases via `DISTINCT case_id` and `NOT IN`, and returns all events from non-matching cases with logical ordering. 

Hypercritical review confirms:
- No logical flaws: Handles multiple sequences per case correctly (excludes if 1 bad instance, aligning with "contains the sequence").
- No inaccuracies: Assumes `datetime` as specified; join conditions ensure consecutiveness.
- No unclarities: Step-by-step explanation is precise; query is efficient and readable.
- Edge cases implicitly handled (e.g., ties in `timestamp` via `ROW_NUMBER()`, null-safe `NOT IN`, empty results).
- Minor nits absent or irrelevant (e.g., optional `ORDER BY` enhances result; activity names quoted correctly).

No deductions warranted.
