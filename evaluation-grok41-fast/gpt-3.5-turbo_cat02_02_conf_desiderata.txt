**3.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Major Inaccuracy/Omission in Normative Violations (deducts ~4 points):** The answer correctly identifies two violations in Case 2 (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection). However, it completely misses the most obvious and explicit normative violation: **no "Inform Applicant" activity at all after Loan Decision**, which is mandatory ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision"; skipping prohibited). This is a clear sequence skip, central to the process description. Case 2 has *three* normative violations, but only two are noted—incomplete and flawed analysis.
- **Inaccuracy in Desiderata (deducts ~1.5 points):** For Case 2, claims "The Credit Check did not occur promptly after receiving the application." Factual error—Application at 08:00, Credit Check at 09:00 (1 hour later), well within the example "short time window (e.g., within 24 hours)." This confuses normative ordering with desiderata timing. Also fails to note the missing Inform Applicant as a promptness failure (though primarily normative).
- **Incomplete Desiderata Coverage (deducts ~1 point):** No mention of Case 1, which lacks a Follow-up Call (desiderata: "encouraged...sometime before closing the case"; none listed in log for any case, explicitly noted only for Case 3, implying universal absence). Should identify all failing cases for completeness. Case 2 and 3 correctly noted for Follow-up absence and Case 3 timings.
- **Missing Required Clarification (deducts ~0.5 points):** Task explicitly requires: "Clarify that while these deviations are not severe, they represent suboptimal behavior." Absent—no such statement, just lists under heading.
- **Strengths (baseline ~3 points awarded):** Structure mirrors task; Case 3 desiderata accurate; interpretations plausible and on-topic (though incomplete for unmentioned Inform skip); no errors in Case 1/3 normative (implicitly correct by omission).
- **Minor Issues (further justification for not higher):** No explicit statement that Case 1 and Case 3 comply with normative rules (task asks to "identify which cases are violating," but ideal response contrasts compliant cases). Interpretations for Case 2 do not address the missed Inform violation. No logical flaws, but unclarities from incompleteness.

Nearly flawless requires zero misses (e.g., all violations listed, accurate timings, full desiderata coverage, explicit clarification)—this has critical gaps, warranting low-mid score under "utmost strictness."
