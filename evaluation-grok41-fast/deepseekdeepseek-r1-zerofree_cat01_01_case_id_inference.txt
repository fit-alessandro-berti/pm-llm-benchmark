**10.0**

The final boxed answer perfectly groups all 18 events into three distinct cases based on consistent `patient_age` and `patient_gender` attributes, with logical sequences of activities (e.g., registration  triage/diagnostic  treatment  discharge), chronological timestamps within each case, and coherent department flows. No events are missing, duplicated, or misassigned; patient details are verbatim and accurate; no logical inconsistencies (e.g., surgery events correctly isolated to Case 3, ER flows intact); presentation is clear, structured, and complete. Utterly flawless.
