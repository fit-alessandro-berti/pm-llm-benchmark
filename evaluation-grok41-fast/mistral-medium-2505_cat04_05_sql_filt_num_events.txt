**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Correctness of Queries (10/10)**: Both SQL queries are logically flawless and precisely match the requirements. The CTE+JOIN version correctly computes event counts per `case_id`, filters `<= 6` via WHERE after INNER JOIN (no data loss for qualifying cases, as all `case_id`s exist in the CTE), and returns `e.*` (all columns, including at least `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`). The subquery+IN version is equally efficient and correct, using HAVING `<= 6` to identify qualifying `case_id`s. Both are valid DuckDB SQL (standard SQL semantics apply). No performance issues, no missing edge cases (e.g., assumes standard data; handles ties perfectly).
- **Completeness (10/10)**: Fully addresses grouping (`GROUP BY case_id`), counting (`COUNT(*)`), filtering (`>6` excluded), and returning full events for qualifying cases. `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` is a nice unasked-for enhancement for readability without altering results.
- **Clarity and Structure (9.5/10)**: Well-formatted with header, code blocks, numbered explanation, and alternative query. Easy to follow. Minor unclarities: double space in "is  6" (typographical nit).
- **Explanation Accuracy (8.0/10)**: Mostly precise, but **one clear inaccuracy**: Bullet 2 states "Keep only events from cases where the count is 6" (implying `= 6`), omitting `<=` despite correct query WHERE/HAVING `<= 6`. This misstates the logic (six *or fewer*, not exactly six), potentially confusing readers skimming explanation without checking code. Intro/header correctly say "six or fewer"/"`<= 6`", and final summary is accurate—but the bullet is a logical flaw in prose. Hypercritical deduction applied.
- **Overall Flaws**: Single inaccuracy in explanation prevents 10 (not "nearly flawless"); no other issues (no unneeded assumptions, no syntax errors, no overcomplication). Strict deduction: -0.8 total for explanation flaw alone.

Nearly perfect; minor prose error keeps it from elite score under hypercritical lens.
