**9.5**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—thorough, well-structured, accurate, and directly aligned with the task's three parts. It correctly identifies violations (only Case 2 normatively violates; Cases 1 and 3 compliant), desiderata failures (all cases fail at least the Follow-up; Case 3 fails all; timings precisely calculated), and provides balanced interpretations/justifications without fabricating facts or excusing strict violations. Headings match the task exactly. Reasoning is logical, evidence-based (cites log timestamps/activities), and clarifies desiderata as "suboptimal/not severe" explicitly.

**Strengths (Justifying High Score):**
- **Accuracy (Perfect):** All normative violations in Case 2 nailed (Risk before Credit; missing Inform; Finalize after reject). No false positives (e.g., doesn't call Case 3's delays normative). Desiderata timings computed flawlessly (e.g., Case 3: 49h/51h exceeds 24h/48h). Follow-up correctly flagged as universal desideratum fail.
- **Comprehensiveness:** Covers sequence skips, ordering, contradictions precisely. Interpretations realistic (e.g., "human error" for Case 2; "resource constraints" for Case 3) and "in line" with constraints (no justifications for normative breaks).
- **Clarity/Structure:** Tabular logic implied via breakdowns; concise yet detailed explanations.
- **Task Fidelity:** Distinguishes strict vs. desiderata perfectly; suggestions contextualized per case.

**Deductions (Hypercritical—Even Minor Flaws Penalized Heavily):**
- **-0.5 for Minor Overstatement in Case 2 Desiderata:** Claims Case 2 "fails one desideratum" (Follow-up), but arguably fails *two* if missing Inform counts as a desiderata failure on "promptly inform" (text implies desiderata applies when step occurs, but skipping prevents "promptness," creating slight ambiguity in counting). It hedges well ("cannot be assessed"), but strict reading could flag Inform absence as an additional suboptimal timing fail. Not a major error, but hypercritical lens demands precision in quantification.
  
No other inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws: No logical gaps (e.g., doesn't ignore Case 2's Decision before full prereqs); no extraneous content impacting core; calculations/log cites impeccable. A 10.0 requires zero nits—this is as near-flawless as possible.
