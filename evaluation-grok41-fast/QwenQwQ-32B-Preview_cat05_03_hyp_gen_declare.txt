**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (for transparency, not part of response)
- **Anomalies (strong but not exhaustive):** Correctly flags noncoexistence(E,C) as contradictory to intended flow requiring both E and C in traces (~core contradiction captured). Notes missing sequence enforcement allowing skips (e.g., RC without A/E), responded_existence gap on order, and missing P/N implicitly. Misses explicit internal model contradiction: AE (responded_existence) + no E+C (noncoexistence) + always C (existence) = impossible if any A occurs. Narrative style vs. clear list; minor misphrase ("not at the same time" vs. trace coexistence).
- **Hypotheses (excellent):** Directly aligns with prompt examples (misinterpretation/missing constraints, pressure for quick closure/skipping, technical/data issues). Three varied, plausible suggestions.
- **Verification (very good, minor flaws):** Queries precisely target key issues (C without E = skipping allowed by model but undesired; A without later E = responded_existence violation; C<E = partial noncoexistence violation). SQL syntactically correct, uses timestamps/resources properly, claim-level aggregation implicit/effective. Misses full noncoexistence check (any E+C coexistence, regardless order) and adjuster links/specialization (per prompt instance). No P/N or init/precedence checks, but not required.
- **Overall:** Nearly comprehensive, directly addresses all tasks independently enough in sections. Hypercritical deductions: -0.5 missed internal contradiction; -0.3 incomplete coexistence query; -0.2 phrasing/structure clarity; -0.3 no adjuster integration/verification of assignment quality. Flawless would explicitly list contradictions (incl. internal), perfect queries covering all (e.g., E+C exists), crisp sections.
