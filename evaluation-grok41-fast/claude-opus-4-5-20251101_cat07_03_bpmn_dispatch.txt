**9.8/10.0**

### Reasoning for Grade
- **Strengths (excellent coverage)**:
  - **Accuracy**: Near-perfect match to the BPMN diagram. Correctly identifies all swimlanes (Logistics, Secretary, Warehouse), tasks, decisions ("Insurance required?", "Special handling?"), gateways (parallel and exclusive), events (start "Ship goods", end "Shipment prepared", 48-hour timer on "Package goods" with delay notification), and data objects (customer info, order details).
  - **Structure & Clarity**: Well-organized with markdown, swimlane breakdowns, key elements summary, and concise process flow explanation. Easy to follow and comprehensive.
  - **Completeness**: Captures coordination (e.g., insurance loop to Logistics, special handling path, parallel execution implied via gateways, warehouse sequence including paperwork and pickup).

- **Minor Deductions (-0.2)**:
  - Slight phrasing imprecision: "Gets 3 offers from logistic companies Selects logistic company and places order" has a missing comma/punctuation, but doesn't affect understanding.
  - No explicit note on gateway merging (e.g., after insurance or special handling), though implied correctly.

This is publication-ready quality—highly detailed and faithful to the diagram.
