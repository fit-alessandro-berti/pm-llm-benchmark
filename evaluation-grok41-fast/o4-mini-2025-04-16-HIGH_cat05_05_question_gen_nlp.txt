The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It delivers exactly 20 distinct, open-ended, thought-provoking questions, each tightly aligned with the described process (e.g., specific suppliers/countries in #1-2, Malaysia assembly in #5, transport modes in #4/6, distribution/regions in #12/15, digital/ML/analytics in #3/6/11/17/18/19, compliance/recalls in #9/16/20). Focus is precisely on insights (#12), issues (#2/4/16), improvements (#5/8/13/19), and implications (#7/10/14/15). No SQL, no extraneous text—just a clean numbered list. Questions are logically sound, clear, diverse (covering geopolitics, sustainability, tech, finance, etc.), and directly derive from/infer extensions of the process without inaccuracies or inventions. Minor phrasing like "our" (e.g., #1/5) enhances immersion without flaw, as it fits the managerial lens implied by the process narrative. No unclarities, redundancies, or gaps.
