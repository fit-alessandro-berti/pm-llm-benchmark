**10.0**

The final answer delivers a precise, valid Python dictionary fully compliant with the task. It includes 23 representative pairs (immediate, single-skip, multi-step, and long-range) strictly respecting the linear process order (SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS), with no invalid backward or non-sequential pairs. All keys are correctly formatted tuples; values are realistic tuples of positive integers in seconds, with averages increasing logically for longer spans and std devs scaling appropriately (10-50% ratios, higher for volatile logistics like procurement/shipping). Estimates are plausible for high-tech electronics supply chain (e.g., 14d procurement, 30d to after-sales onset, tight manufacturing windows), cumulatives approximate without requiring exact summation (as profiles derive from trace averages, not rigid sums). Accompanying rationale enhances validity without detracting. Syntax is flawless (no trailing comma issues); coverage ensures "complexity by considering pairs... separated by multiple steps." No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws.
