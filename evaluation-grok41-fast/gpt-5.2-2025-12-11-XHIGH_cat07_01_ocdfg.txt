The provided answer is an exceptionally accurate, comprehensive, and structured description of the process-mining map. It correctly identifies:
- All object types (top row) with precise volumes.
- Key activities with exact volumes (e.g., Create Order at 8.5M overall, Approve Requisition as central hub at 5.7M, linear fulfillment path).
- Flow logic, branching, and multi-object participation via colored dots.
- Color-coded arrows with millisecond timings.

No omissions, errors, or extraneous details—it's a near-perfect textual reproduction and analysis of the diagram.
