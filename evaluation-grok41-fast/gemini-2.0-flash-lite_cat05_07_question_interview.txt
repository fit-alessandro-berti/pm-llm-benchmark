**9.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: The response is exceptionally thorough, directly aligned with the prompt's five key areas (missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, exceptions). All 22 questions are targeted, open-ended (using "what," "how," "elaborate," "walk me through"), conceptual (no SQL/tech implementation), and tied to the process description. Categorization mirrors the prompt perfectly, enhancing usability without being required. Rationales in italics demonstrate precise intent, adding value. Covers nuances like escalations, risks, and specifics (e.g., #17 on insurance) without hallucinating details. No inaccuracies or requests for forbidden elements.

- **Flaws Deducting from Perfection (Strict Deductions)**:
  - **Minor scope creep (0.4 deduction)**: #13 ("updating...after onboarding") probes *post-onboarding* maintenance, slightly outside the described "onboarding process" (ends at move-in/audits). Process is onboarding-specific; this infers lifecycle extension not explicitly bounded, introducing logical drift.
  - **Borderline implementation hints (0.2 deduction)**: #6 ("system or tool to assist"), #7 ("scoring system"), #11 ("playbook") toe the line of "implementation details" by implying tools/process artifacts. Conceptual enough for decision criteria, but hypercritically, they risk specificity over pure understanding (prompt emphasizes "conceptual").
  - **Redundancy/verbiage (0.1 deduction)**: #2 and #9/#19 overlap on follow-ups/escalations; #14/#15 duplicate timeline granularity. Minor bloat in a "series" (not exhaustive encyclopedia), reducing efficiency.
  - **Nitpick on phrasing (0.1 deduction)**: #5's examples (e.g., "single-family homes") assume/infer property types not specified, potentially leading interviewee off-track (though open-ended).

- **Overall**: Nearly flawless (elite coverage, structure, relevance), but strict policy demands docking for even these tiny issues. 10.0 reserved for zero debatable flaws. This is production-grade with trivial polish needed.
