The final grouped cases perfectly cover all 18 events without overlap or omission, with correct event assignments based on matching patient_age, patient_gender, department consistency, logical activity sequences (e.g., registration  triage  diagnostics  consultation  discharge for ER cases; registration  consultation  prep  surgery  recovery  discharge for surgery case), timestamp ordering within each case, and alignment of additional_info, resources, and diagnoses. Patient attributes uniquely distinguish the three cases. Summaries are precise and accurate. Key observations are comprehensive, evidence-based, and free of flaws, unclarities, or inaccuracies.
