### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (why not lower):**
- **Core logic is correct and precise**: The `sequence_cases` CTE accurately identifies cases with the exact direct-succession sequence using self-joins on increasing timestamps and `NOT EXISTS` to enforce no intervening events between each pair. This perfectly captures "direct succession with no other event in between."
- **Timing filter is accurate**: `DATEDIFF('day', create_order_time, confirm_order_time) > 5` correctly uses DuckDB syntax for whole-day differences >5 days, applied only to matching sequences.
- **Exclusion logic flawless**: `NOT IN` on `filtered_cases` excludes *entire cases* meeting *both* criteria, returning *all events* from remaining cases—exactly as specified.
- **Handles multiples robustly**: Works for cases with multiple potential triplets (includes case if *any* qualifying triplet has >5 days).
- **Ordering appropriate**: `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` provides logical event-log presentation, aligning with "proper ordering."
- **DuckDB compatibility**: All functions (`DATEDIFF`, `NOT EXISTS`, etc.) are native and correct.
- **Explanation clear and helpful**: Step-by-step breakdown, performance notes, and caveats add value without errors.

**Deductions (hypercritical flaws, even minor):**
- **-0.5 for incomplete/erroneous footnotes**: Explanation ends with "[1][2][3][5]" (skips [4]) and vague refs—unprofessional sloppiness in presentation, distracting from perfection.
- **No `DISTINCT` in `filtered_cases`**: Unnecessary duplicates possible (minor perf hit, though `NOT IN` ignores them). Hypercritically, a `SELECT DISTINCT case_id` would be cleaner/flawless.
- **Assumes strict timestamp inequality**: Uses `>`, excluding same-timestamp "events" (rare in logs, but prompt doesn't specify; could use `>=` with activity uniqueness implied—minor ambiguity risk).

Nearly flawless (flawless = 10.0); these are nitpicks, but strictness demands deduction. No logical errors, inaccuracies, or failures to meet requirements.
