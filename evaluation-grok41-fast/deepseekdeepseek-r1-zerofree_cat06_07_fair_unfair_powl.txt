**7.0**

### Explanation of Grade (for transparency, not part of response):
- **Strengths (supporting ~7)**: Correctly identifies and uses appropriate labels (e.g., RequestMoreInfo, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck). Properly places LOOP for data completeness and XOR precisely after SkillAssessment in the unfair model to capture the bias point. Fair model correctly removes XOR, using a single sequential PO. Overall structure reflects the process description accurately in intent, sequence, and bias demonstration. Final boxed code is clean, self-contained, and executable as snippets.
- **Weaknesses (preventing higher score)**: Major logical flaw in unfair model's POWL construction—SkillAssessment is listed in *both* Order1.nodes and Order2.nodes (same shared object), with Order1  Order2 edge. This implies double execution of SkillAssessment (once in Order1, again in Order2), which is semantically incorrect for the workflow and violates clean POWL partial order execution (sub-POs execute their nodes independently). Could be fixed with a single encompassing PO or by omitting SkillAssessment from Order2.nodes/edges (implicit ordering via nesting suffices). Minor issues: unused Skip everywhere; redundant variable redefinitions between models; extra visualization comment not requested. Hypercritical evaluation penalizes the structural inaccuracy significantly, as it renders the unfair model non-flawless despite strong conceptual match. Equivalent to a "good but buggy code" submission.
