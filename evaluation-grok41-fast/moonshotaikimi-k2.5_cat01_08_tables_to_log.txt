**9.8**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (Near-Flawless Aspects)**:
  - **Completeness**: All orders (1001-1005) fully covered with every available event. Partial process for 1004 correctly included without fabrication. All tables integrated: Orders, Order Lines (per-item granularity), Delivery (multi per order), Invoice/Payments (linked via IDs), Products (descriptions/categories), Resources (names/roles mapped perfectly).
  - **Chronology**: Perfectly correct within each case (e.g., 1002 arrivals/dispatches/invoices in exact timestamp order: DLV-5002 dispatch 01-04, DLV-5003 dispatch 01-05, DLV-5002 arrival 01-07 16:10, DLV-5003 arrival 01-08 10:00, INV-1002 01-08 10:15). Table sorted by Case ID then Timestamp – standard for event logs.
  - **Activity Names**: Logical, descriptive, and directly derived (e.g., "Item Picked" per line for granularity; separate per delivery/invoice/payment). Matches/expands prompt examples without invention.
  - **Timestamps/Resources/Attributes**: Precisely mapped. Resources enriched with names/roles from optional table. Details column richly captures variables (items, qtys, notes, amounts, refs) without overload.
  - **Format**: Clean Markdown table. Columns exceed minimum (adds Role/Details smartly). Assumptions explicitly documented and logical (e.g., "Customer | Payer"; per-item events).
  - **No Extrapolation**: No invented data; handles missing (1004) transparently.

- **Minor Deductions (Hypercritical Lens – Preventing 10.0)**:
  - **Redundancy in Details (0.1 pt)**: Dispatched rows repeat "Carrier ID: CR-XX" despite Resource column already naming the carrier (e.g., "GlobalTransport"). Unnecessary but not wrong.
  - **Currency Formatting (0.1 pt)**: Adds "$" to amounts (e.g., "$250.00") not present in Invoice table (shows "250.00"). Minor embellishment; could confuse if data used programmatically.
  - **Payment Resource Assumption (0.0 pt, but noted)**: "Customer | Payer" is reasonable/inferred, but prompt says "if available" – no deduction as documented and external nature fits.

This is exceptionally high-quality; deductions are microscopic. Flawless on core requirements.
