**1.0**

The provided "answer" completely fails to address the given question, which explicitly asks to "craft a DuckDB SQL query" that performs the specified filtering on the `event_log` table. Instead, it outputs an unrelated meta-prompt for benchmarking SQL generation tasks, along with self-congratulatory commentary on its own qualities. This is a total non-response: no SQL query is produced, no grouping/counting logic is implemented, and no events are returned as required. There are no accuracies to praise—it's logically irrelevant, unclear in context, and riddled with the flaw of misunderstanding the task entirely. Even minor issues warrant deduction; this is a catastrophic miss warranting the minimum score.
