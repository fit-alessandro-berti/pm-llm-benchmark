**9.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**:
  - Correctly identifies **all violating cases** (2, 3, 5) and **non-violating cases** (1, 4) with no errors in classification.
  - Excellent structure: Per-case analysis with sequences, clear violation statements, explanations referencing normative rules, and concise summary.
  - Explanations accurately tie to key constraints (e.g., Case 2 cites payment before packaging; Case 3 cites no shipping after cancel; Case 5 cites packaging before shipping). Matches explicit examples from description (e.g., "packaging items before authorization", "shipping after cancellation").
  - Interprets ambiguities well (e.g., infers branch logic after "Check inventory" without overreaching).
  - No fabrication, logical contradictions, or unclarities in overall logic. Covers core task fully.

- **Flaws (deductions for strictness, totaling -1.0)**:
  - **Minor logical inaccuracy in Case 5 phrasing** (-0.5): States ""Ship order" activity occurs before "Package items."" This is imprecise because "Package items" never occurs in the log—Ship occurs *without* (not "before") Package. Better: "Ship order occurs without preceding Package items." This is a small semantic/logical flaw, but hypercritical standards treat it as notable inaccuracy.
  - **Incomplete explanation in Case 3** (-0.5): Notes only Ship after Cancel (correct and key), but omits additional clear deviations: (1) "Authorize payment" before "Cancel order" violates "directly proceed to Cancel" after insufficient inventory (branch logic); (2) no "Package items" before Ship (another instance of "items must be prepared before shipped"). Explanation covers *a* violation but not *the* violations (plural per task), making it partial under strict completeness.
  - Negligible formatting nit (sequences use inconsistent spacing like "Receive order  Check inventory" without bullets/commas; readable but unpolished; no deduction as minor).

- **Why not 10.0?** Not "nearly flawless"—two issues (one inaccuracy, one incompleteness) prevent perfection, per "even minor issues significantly lower."
- **Why not lower?** Flaws are minor/isolated; core analysis, identification, and rule-referencing are flawless. No major errors (e.g., wrong cases, misread log, ignored timestamps). 9.0 reflects "excellent with tiny room for polish."
