**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: The answer fully structures response around the 4 tasks: clear identification of *per-case* recurrences (Verify Documents in C001/C003; Call Customer in C002), excellent renamed log mirroring original format precisely (only Activity changed, tables intact), highly descriptive names directly tied to context/resources/timings, and detailed justification with explicit clue mappings. Disambiguates perfectly *within cases* (e.g., C002's two Calls now uniquely "Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy" vs "Follow-up Call to Confirm Adjustments"; C001's Verifies as "Check Identity Documents" vs "Re-check Documents with ID Scan"). Improves process flow visibility without altering non-Activity columns. Proactive consistency across cases enhances utility without breaking rules.
- **Deductions (strict penalties for minor issues)**:
  - **Minor logical flaw in scope (-0.4)**: Task specifies "activities that appear multiple times *within the same case*" and "for each activity that *recurs*" (implying rename occurrences in those specific cases). Renamed *all* instances of recurring activities (e.g., single "Call Customer" in C001/C003 to specific names; single "Verify Documents" in C002 to "Verify Identity"), admitting "I've renamed all for consistency." This overreaches beyond strict per-case recurrence (e.g., C001's Call doesn't recur there, no intra-case disambiguation needed). Transparent but deviates from precision.
  - **Minor stylistic inconsistencies in names (-0.2)**: Varied conventions (e.g., "Check Identity Documents" vs "Verify Identity"; "Re-check" vs "Re-verify"; "Physical ID Verification" drops "Documents" while others retain; "ID" vs "Documents"). Reflects contexts well but lacks uniform pattern (e.g., consistent "Verify Documents: [modifier]" prefix), slightly reducing clarity.
  - **Minor over-detailing (-0.1)**: Justification excellent and clue-based but exceeds "briefly" (lengthy subsections vs concise), though not inaccurate.
  - **No other flaws**: No factual errors (e.g., correct recurrence counts), no unclarities, no log alterations beyond task, perfect disambiguation where required, intuitive strategy explanation.
- **Overall**: Nearly flawless (superior to typical responses), but strict deductions for scope creep and polish drop from 10.0. A 10.0 requires zero deviations, perfect uniformity, and exact adherence.
