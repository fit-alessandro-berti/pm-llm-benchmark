The final output is exemplary: precisely constructs two valid, distinct POWL models using the specified pm4py classes and syntax, with exact activity labels from the description. Model 1 correctly embeds the XOR operator post-SkillAssessment for the biased branch (CulturalFitCheck XOR CommunityAffiliationCheck), enabling unfairness via selective paths. Model 2 eliminates this by sequencing a uniform CulturalFitCheck. The LOOP operator accurately captures the data completeness iteration (DataCompletenessCheck as condition/entry, RequestMoreInfo as body/redo trigger). StrictPartialOrder enforces required sequentiality via edges, with no extraneous concurrency, silents, or disqualifiers (appropriately omitted for proceeding paths). Separate object instances per model ensure independence. Code is syntactically correct, modular, commented clearly, and self-contained. Explanation reinforces without redundancy. Zero inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws.
