**7.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting higher score):**
  - **Anomaly Identification:** Accurately flags out-of-order sequences (1002, 1003, 1004), missing steps (1004), timing issues (1004), and specific flags like `shipment_scheduled=N` followed by shipping. Hypotheses (system errors, policy violations, training issues) are logical and tied to examples. Structure is clear and comprehensive.
  - **Most SQL Queries (4/5 excellent):** 
    - Query 1: Clever position-based mismatch detection using window functions; correctly identifies out-of-order via step comparisons (works on sample data, e.g., catches 1002/1003/1004 mismatches).
    - Query 3: Perfectly isolates payment-before-invoice (e.g., 1004).
    - Query 4: Accurate LIKE pattern match for shipment contradictions (e.g., 1004).
    - Query 5: Correct correlated subquery for rapid timing; PostgreSQL-compliant.
  - **Overall Structure & Next Steps:** Polished, actionable; covers hypotheses without hints; uses only relevant tables.
  - Queries are PostgreSQL-valid (except one), self-contained, and investigate stated hypotheses.

- **Major Flaws (significant deductions for strictness):**
  - **Query 2 Broken (fatal logical/SQL error, -2.0):** LEFT JOIN only on `activity` (no `case_id` condition) produces duplicates/no nulls for per-case missing checks. Returns empty results since activities exist *somewhere* (e.g., misses Validate Stock in 1003/1004 entirely). Core failure for "missing activities" investigation—hypotheses can't be validated. Requires CROSS JOIN or NOT EXISTS for per-case combos.
  - **Incomplete Anomaly Spotting (-0.5):** Misses Validate Stock absent in 1003 (6 events, no mention under missing/out-of-order examples despite table data); Query 1 indirectly catches via mismatches, but narrative overlooks.
  - **Query 1 Imperfection (-0.3):** Position-matching assumes fixed 7 steps; coincident matches (e.g., 1004 step 4/5) could understate skips/duplicates; better as pairwise order checks (e.g., LAG/LEAD or ts comparisons).
  - **Minor Unclarities (-0.2):** No resource table queries despite schema (e.g., no dept/role validation query, though none anomalous); "No Anomaly" in resources section but still hypothesizes system error.

Nearly flawless except Query 2's showstopper bug + misses drop from 10.0. Functional for most data/hypotheses, but not "hyper-accurate."
