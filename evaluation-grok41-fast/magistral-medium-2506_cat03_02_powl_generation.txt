**10.0**

The provided code and explanation are flawless. It precisely constructs the hierarchical POWL model matching the scenario:

- Correct transitions with exact labels.
- Proper `Operator.LOOP([BNC, DR])` for the repeating BNC  optional DR.
- Proper `Operator.XOR([CD, MD])` for exclusive deployment choice.
- `final_tasks` as `StrictPartialOrder([QA, SA, GLA])` with edges `QA  GLA`, `SA  GLA` for concurrency before GLA.
- `main_order` as root `StrictPartialOrder` with all nodes and exact edges: `SR  CS  {DA || ACI}  loop  XOR  final_tasks`, enabling concurrency where specified (DA || ACI; QA || SA) and strict ordering elsewhere via direct/transitive dependencies.
- No extraneous edges, silents, or nodes; leverages POWL hierarchy correctly (e.g., edges to compound nodes like `final_tasks` ensure prerequisites for their internals).
- Faithful to semantics, imports, and classes; explanation accurately summarizes without errors.
