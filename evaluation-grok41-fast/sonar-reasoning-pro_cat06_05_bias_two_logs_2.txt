**9.8**

The answer is nearly flawless in identifying **Group B** as exhibiting bias, with precise data-driven comparisons (e.g., U001/P002, U003/P002 tables accurately highlight unequal outcomes from the +5 boost). Manifestation is clearly articulated via unequal scoring, disproportionate hires, and non-merit favoritism, directly tied to log evidence without extrapolation errors. Implications for fairness/equity are comprehensive, logically linking to inequity, misuse of cultural fit, diversity erosion, and remediation steps. Minor deduction for speculative phrasing ("hidden pathway" despite explicit log annotations) and unverified external references ([1][4] etc., potentially hallucinatory), but these do not undermine core accuracy or conclusions. Structure enhances clarity without fluff.
