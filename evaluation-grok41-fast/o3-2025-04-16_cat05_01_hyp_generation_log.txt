**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (supporting high base score):**
- **Completeness of core elements (9.5/10):** Fully includes schema descriptions, nominal process flow, and all event log sample data across 4 cases (cleanly formatted and consolidated vs. original's messy multi-tables). Output format is *exact* match for desired structure (A/B/C sections, anomaly references, per-query comments). Tasks precisely mirror requirements: anomaly detection via comparison, grounded hypotheses with examples (no spoilers), SQL proposals using PostgreSQL features (intervals/CTEs allowed).
- **No hints on specific anomalies (10/10):** LLM must discover issues (e.g., case 1002 skips credit/stock before shipping; case 1004 payment pre-invoice; missing steps/out-of-order timestamps/resources). No leading examples or "look for X."
- **Encourages correct behaviors (10/10):** Hypotheses tied to data/context (e.g., fraud/rush); SQL focused on investigation/refutation; "thorough yet concise"; plain language; no execution/results.
- **Usability/readability (9.8/10):** Concise, verbatim copy-paste ready; strict format prevents verbose/meandering responses; business context preserved.

**Flaws (strict deductions, each significantly impacting score):**
- **Schema relationship inaccuracies (-1.2):** Critical error in FK directions. States `orders.case_id (PK) – FK to order_event_log.case_id` and `resources.resource_id (PK) – FK to order_event_log.resource`. This reverses reality: log.case_id/resource *reference* orders.case_id/resource_id (many-to-one). Log.case_id isn't PK/unique. Confuses data model (e.g., LLM might mishandle uniqueness/joins/constraints in hypotheses/queries). Original schema avoids this by saying "Matches"; prompt *adds* wrong detail. Not minor—logical flaw risking bad LLM outputs.
- **Incomplete example data (-0.4):** Omits orders/resources *sample rows* despite original labeling them "Additional Reference Tables (Just Schemas and Sample Rows)." LLM can't ground hypotheses in specifics like `order_type='priority'` (case 1002 anomalous), high `order_value` correlations (case 1004=3000 fraud?), or full `role`/`department` (e.g., confirm FinanceTeam_02='Cashier'). Schema "e.g." insufficient for "grounded in data." Prompt claims "full schema, example data"—misleading/inaccurate.
- **Minor unclarities (-0.2):** Nominal flow labels "(Warehouse)" mismatches resources `department=Logistics` (potential unprompted anomaly, but unlabeled). Sample tables use informal ----- separators (works, but not pristine markdown).

**Overall:** Nearly flawless execution (would elicit excellent LLM responses), but schema errors + data omission prevent 9.5+. 8.2 reflects "very good" with "significant" flaws per criteria. Lower would undervalue structure; higher ignores inaccuracies.
