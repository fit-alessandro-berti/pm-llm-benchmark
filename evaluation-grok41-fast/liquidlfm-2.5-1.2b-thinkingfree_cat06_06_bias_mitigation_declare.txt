**2.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Summary (for transparency, not part of grade):
- **Preservation of original model**: Fails catastrophically. Original `coexistence` ("StartApplication"  "FinalDecision") is completely overwritten with invalid entries. Original `response` ("StartApplication"  "RequestAdditionalInfo") is mangled into unary/invalid format under wrong key ("RequestAdditionalInfo"  unary dict, missing inner activity). This violates "add new constraints" explicitly—originals must remain intact.
- **New constraints format/validity**: Invalid. `coexistence` (binary) gets unary dicts ("ManualReviewValidation": unary) and malformed binary ("decision": {"ManagedCheck": ...}). No use of suggested types like `non-succession`, `precedence`, or proper ties to sensitive attributes (e.g., no "CheckApplicantRace"  "ManualReview"  "Reject"). Made-up names ("ManualReviewValidation", "decision", "ManagedCheck") are vague/unrelated to prompt's examples (ApplicantAge/Gender/Race, BiasMitigationCheck, ManualReview).
- **Bias mitigation logic**: Absent/incorrect. Coexistence misused as "precede" (coexistence means anywhere-in-trace co-occurrence, not sequence/order). No enforcement of "additional checks" before biased decisions (e.g., no `precedence["CheckApplicantRace"]["ManualReview"]` or `nonsuccession["CheckApplicantRace"]["Reject"]`). Fails prompt's examples entirely.
- **Rationale**: Inadequate. Not "brief rationale for *each* added constraint" (lists none specifically). Vague/misleading ("synchronous checks", "precede decisions"—wrong semantics). No link to sensitive attributes or loan bias reduction.
- **Output completeness**: Python code parses but is semantically/bias-irrelevant junk. Ignores "valid Python code" with DECLARE structure. No proper documentation.
- **Overall**: Fundamentally broken; worse than minimal effort. Attempts structure but executes with pervasive errors. Only 2.0 for partial dict copy-paste and vague bias keywords.
