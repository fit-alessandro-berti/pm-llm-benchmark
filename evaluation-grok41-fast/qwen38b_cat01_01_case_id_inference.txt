The final grouping is completely accurate, covering all 18 events without overlap or omission. Patient attributes (age, gender, insurance) are perfectly consistent within each case, event sequences follow logical hospital workflows (e.g., registration before triage before diagnostics before discharge), departments align (ER for Cases 1-2, Surgery for Case 3), and intra-case timestamps are strictly increasing. The summary logic is precise and comprehensive, with no ambiguities or errors.
