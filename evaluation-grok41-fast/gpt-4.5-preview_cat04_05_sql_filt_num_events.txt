**10.0**

The provided SQL query is logically flawless, precisely matches the requirements, and executes correctly in DuckDB (or any standard SQL engine). It accurately identifies cases with 6 events via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`, then returns all events (`SELECT *`) for those `case_id`s using a correlated `IN` subquery. No inaccuracies, inefficiencies impacting correctness, unclarities, or flaws—handling grouping/filtering perfectly, even for edge cases (e.g., zero events per case, ties at exactly 6). The explanation is concise, accurate, and directly reinforces the query's intent without extraneous details. This is exemplary and merits a perfect score under hypercritical scrutiny.
