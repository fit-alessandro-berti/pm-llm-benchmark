**4.0**

### Critical Evaluation:
- **Major inaccuracy in fitness (primary deduction: -4.0 points)**: The model fails to replay Case 3's trace (AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC). The loop's `A = X(->(RMI, VF), tau)` forces any RMI to be strictly paired with an immediately following VF, preventing consecutive RMIs (RMI  RMI). No combination of choices generates RMI  RMI  VF; possible visible suffixes after AE are only: ADSCAC, RMIVFADSCAC, or undesired overgenerations like RMIVFADSCACRMIVF. Case 3 has 0% replay fitness, undermining the required "repetitions of requesting missing info."
- **Logical flaw in loop semantics and placement (-1.5 points)**: Placing ADSCAC as the loop's `B` (repeat body) coincidentally works for Cases 1-2 via extra silent taus (e.g., tau  ADSCAC  tau for skip; RMIVF  ADSCAC  tau for single), but this is fragile and incidental—not by design. Multiple iterations would insert extra ADSCAC mid-loop (e.g., RMIVF  ADSCAC  RMIVF), overgeneralizing invalid traces. True skip (tau  exit) omits AD entirely, making completion reliant on forced repeats. This misuses loop semantics (* executes `A` first, repeat via `B`  `A`, exit after `A`).
- **Mismatch with log observations and task (-0.5 points)**: Explanation claims "RMI VF repeated" captures Cases 1 & 3, but Case 3 shows RMI repetition *before* single re-VF, not (RMIVF)*. Task requires capturing "possible repetitions of requesting missing info and re-validation"; model captures neither consecutive RMI nor true multi-iteration re-VF without artifacts.
- **Minor issues (-0.0 net, but noted)**: tau unquoted (should be `'tau'` per notation); comment `//` informal. Balances precision/simplicity somewhat (avoids overgeneralization beyond log variants), but fitness failure dominates.
- **Why not lower?** Partial credit for correct main sequence (RAVFAE...), optional single-loop approximation for Cases 1-2, silent-step usage, and structure format. Nearly flawless would require e.g., loop modeling RMI*  VF (optional repeat) XOR direct-to-AD, fitting all traces perfectly.
