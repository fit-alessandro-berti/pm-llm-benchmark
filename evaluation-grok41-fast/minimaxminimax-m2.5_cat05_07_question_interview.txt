**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (driving high score)**: 
  - Perfectly on-topic: Produces exactly a **list of targeted, open-ended questions** (95%+ are purely open-ended like "How do you...", "What criteria...", "Can you describe..."), grouped logically for clarity, directly addressing all specified goals (missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, exceptions). Comprehensive coverage of the process description without gaps (e.g., documentation checklists, remediation workflows, SLAs, KPIs, variations).
  - No violations: Zero SQL, code, or low-level implementation (tool questions like Q28/Q39 are conceptual/process-oriented, e.g., "how is communication recorded?", not "what tables?").
  - Enhances conceptual understanding: Questions probe exactly the right depths (e.g., escalation paths, handoffs, audits), with examples encouraged (Q27) for vividness.
  - Structure excellent: Categories make it scannable/user-friendly; summary reinforces alignment without detracting.

- **Minor Flaws (deducting 0.8 total, per strictness)**:
  - **Phrasing issues (2 questions, -0.3)**: Q6 and Q29 use semi-binary "Is X or Y?" structures, which could elicit yes/no before elaboration— not purely open-ended (ideal: rephrase to "How is the assignment determined, including any automation or approvals?"). Minor, as follow-ups open them up, but hypercritical flaw.
  - **Formatting/typos (-0.3)**: Inconsistent bolding (e.g., "**PropertyManager**", "**tenantscreening**"), smashed words ("openended", "leadtime", "daystoactivate"). Cosmetic but unprofessional in a "final" list; signals haste.
  - **Overkill length (-0.1)**: 40 questions is exhaustive (great for depth) but borders on untargeted shotgun vs. a concise "series" (prompt implies 10-20 prioritized); still valuable.
  - **Extraneous text (-0.1)**: "Why these questions?" and "Feel free..." add helpful meta but exceed "produce a list"—pure list would be flawless.

Nearly flawless (flaws <5% impact, all superficial/logical nits; corrects any think-tag verbosity by ignoring it). No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws in content—award withheld from 10.0 solely for these.
