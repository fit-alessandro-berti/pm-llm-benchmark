**3.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
**Strengths (limited, warranting ~3/10 base):**
- Correctly identifies core activities (Order Created, Item Picked per line, Dispatched/Arrived per delivery, etc.).
- Uses `order_id` as Case ID.
- Maps resources to names from Resources table accurately where applied.
- Includes timestamps correctly for shown events.
- Attempts chronological sorting within cases (e.g., 1001 events in order).
- Uses "Additional Attributes" column for extras, which is pragmatic for variable data.
- Links payments via invoice_id to order_id (planned correctly).

**Critical Flaws (deducting heavily; each major issue -1.0+):**
1. **Incomplete event log (-2.5)**: Table is **truncated mid-event** (ends at 1002's second Item Picked timestamp). Missing ~70% of events:
   - Order 1002: Only 1 full Item Picked; missing second Item Picked (ITEM-005), both deliveries (DLV-5002/5003 with dispatch/arrival x4 events), both invoices (INV-1002/1003), both payments (PAY-2002/2003).
   - Order 1003: **Entirely absent** (Created, 2x Item Picked, Dispatched/Arrived for DLV-5004, INV-1004, PAY-2004).
   - Order 1004: **Absent** (must include Created + Item Picked for ITEM-001).
   - Order 1005: **Absent** (Created, 2x Item Picked, Dispatched/Arrived for DLV-5005, INV-1005, PAY-2005).
   - Prompt mandates: "Ensure that every event for every `order_id` is included." This violates directly.

2. **Arbitrary/inaccurate data (-1.0)**: Payment "Resource: System" invented; no basis in tables (prompt: "if the tables contain information"; otherwise blank/omit). Should be empty.

3. **Inconsistent/omitted attributes (-0.8)**: 
   - Order Created omits `customer_id` entirely (e.g., 1001 shows only type/priority; data has CUST-ABC).
   - No `invoice_id`/`invoice_amount` in Payment attributes for 1001 (inconsistent with plan).
   - No `quantity` formatting consistent (e.g., "quantity: 2" vs data).

4. **Unclear/poor output structure (-0.8)**: Bloated with ~2000+ words of repetitive pseudocode/planning ("Let's code accordingly" x multiple). Prompt demands "**Output Format**: ... structured table (in Markdown format)". Final table should dominate; this buries it.

5. **No full sorting across all events (-0.5)**: Per-case sorting good, but no global sort by Case ID + Timestamp evident (incomplete anyway).

6. **Incomplete assumptions documentation (-0.4)**: Lists some, but misses key ones (e.g., blank payment resource, per-line granularity explicit, handling incomplete orders like 1004, Products table ignored ok but unstated).

7. **Minor formatting/logical slips (-0.3)**: Table headers mismatch plan slightly; attributes strings lack quotes/escapes (e.g., notes with commas unhandled); no Products integration (optional, but item descriptions could enrich).

**Overall**: Demonstrates conceptual grasp but fails core deliverable (complete table). Equivalent to submitting a half-built product. Strictly, <4.0; partial accuracy prevents 1-2.0. Not "nearly flawless" (requires 9+).
