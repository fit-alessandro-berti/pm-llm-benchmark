### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (why not lower):**
- **Core logic is flawless (9.5+ territory)**: Perfect use of window functions (LEAD with offsets 1 and 2) to detect *direct succession* (consecutive events with no intermediates). Correctly identifies the exact sequence starting from 'Approve Purchase Requisition'. Time diff precisely between the relevant 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in *that sequence*. DISTINCT case_id handles multiples correctly. NOT IN exclusion returns *all events* from non-matching cases. Handles edge cases implicitly (e.g., insufficient subsequent events  NULL  no match).
- **Clear, concise explanation**: Matches query logic, highlights key insight (consecutiveness via LEAD).
- **DuckDB-appropriate**: Window functions, timestamp ordering, interval arithmetic conceptually correct.

**Inaccuracies/Unclarities/Flaws (deductions totaling -1.0):**
- **Syntax error in interval (-0.5)**: `INTERVAL 5 DAYS` is invalid DuckDB SQL. Correct syntax is `INTERVAL 5 DAY` (singular "DAY"; DuckDB interval keywords are always singular: DAY, not DAYS). `INTERVAL '5 days'` or `INTERVAL '5' DAY` also works, but as written, query fails with syntax error ("unexpected 'DAYS'"). Minor fix, but prevents execution—unacceptable for benchmark SQL.
- **Incomplete columns selected (-0.3)**: SELECTs only `case_id, activity, timestamp`, but prompt specifies "return **all events** from `event_log`" (table has "**at least**" those columns, implying possibly more like resources, costs). Must use `SELECT *` for complete events. Partial projection loses data.
- **Missing ordering (-0.2)**: No `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` (or equivalent). Prompt requires "**proper** ... **ordering**"; raw `event_log` dump is unordered. Expected for clean, log-like output from filtered cases.

Nearly flawless logic/approach elevates score despite nits; any lower would undervalue ingenuity. Fix syntax/columns/ordering  10.0.
