**7.2**

### Justification for Grade (Strict Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting higher score):**
  - **Structure and Completeness**: Excellently organized with clear sections for anomalies, severity, alignment, and conclusion. Covers task fully: analyzes both models vs. standard, identifies multiple anomalies per model with specifics tied to edges/operators, compares severity logically, justifies choice with process integrity focus.
  - **Key Anomalies Accurate**: Correctly flags Model 1's skipping interviews (Screen  Decide path), lack of Interview  Decide (enabling wrong orders/parallelism). For Model 2: skipping screening (Post  Interview), unordered Screen/Interview, optional payroll (XOR skip). Recognizes partial order implications well.
  - **Severity & Conclusion Logical**: Valid argument that Model 1 enforces screening (mandatory for progression to Decide/Close) and correct late sequence (Onboard  Payroll  Close required), vs. Model 2's foundational skips (Screen optional) and extras (loop repeats unmentioned but not needed). Picks Model 1 as closer defensibly, emphasizing "core structure" preservation. No unclarities here.
  - **No Repetition/Verbosity**: Concise final answer.

- **Flaws (strict deductions, -2.8 total):**
  - **Major Inaccuracy: "Deadlock" Claims (#1 & #2 in both models, labeled severe)**: Fundamentally wrong. StrictPartialOrder semantics enable activities based on predecessors only; no "outgoing edge" from Interview (Model 1) or Screen (Model 2) does **not** cause halt/deadlock. In Model 1, post-Screen, Decide enabled independently (doable before/after/with Interview); process completes via Decide branch. In Model 2, post-Post, Interview enabled independently of Screen. These are "dangling leaves" (optional side-steps), not deadlocks. Misrepresents execution semantics, inflates "severity" artificially. Hypercritical penalty: -1.5 (core logical flaw in model understanding).
  - **Minor Incompleteness**: Ignores Model 2's loop_onboarding anomaly (allows 1+ Onboards via LOOP(Onboard, skip), deviating from standard one-time onboarding). Not listed, though others covered. -0.5.
  - **Minor Overstatement**: Model 1's "parallel or reverse order" correct but phrased as "unstructured partial order between Decide and Interview implies... reverse order" — reverse (Decide  Interview) possible yes, but not emphasized as equally bad as skipping. Slight unbalance. -0.4.
  - **Minor Ambiguity in Severity**: Claims Model 2 "fundamentally worse" due to early skips, but both miss one mandatory step (Model 1 skips Interview; Model 2 skips Screen) with similar sequence gaps (Model 1 misses Interview  Decide; Model 2 misses Screen  Interview). Defensible but not "nearly flawless" precision. -0.4.

Nearly high (8+ would require zero semantics errors, full anomaly coverage, bulletproof comparison). Errors prevent "flawless"; 7.2 reflects strong overall but strict penalties for inaccuracies.
