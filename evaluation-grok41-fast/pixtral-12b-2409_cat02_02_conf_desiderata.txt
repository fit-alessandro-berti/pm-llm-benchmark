**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (supporting the score):**
  - Correctly identifies no normative violations in Case 1 and Case 3, with accurate sequence explanations.
  - For Case 2 normative: Catches two key violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection). Good structure mirroring the task (per-case analysis, summary).
  - Desiderata identification mostly accurate: Case 1 (only no follow-up), Case 3 (timings + no follow-up).
  - Provides interpretations/justifications for deviations (Task 3), speculative but reasonable and tied to operational issues.
  - Clear tabular/log reference via summarized activities; concise summary table.

- **Major Inaccuracies/Flaws (significant deductions):**
  - **Critical miss on Case 2 normative (Task 1):** Completely omits the mandatory "Inform Applicant" step, which is explicitly required *after Loan Decision* and *before Close Case* for *both* approve/reject (per sequence: "Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [branch]"). Log shows no Inform at all (Decision at 09:30  Finalize 10:00  Close 10:30). This is a clear skip of a non-branching required activity ("the applicant must be informed"), equivalent in severity to the caught violations. Failing to flag this makes the analysis incomplete/inaccurate for the "strict sequence/no skipping" rules. Alone warrants ~2-point deduction.
  - **Logical flaw in Case 2 desiderata (Task 2):** Dismisses as "not applicable due to normative violation." Desiderata are explicitly *independent/additional* ("In addition to the strict sequence... not a serious problem"). Timings (e.g., Credit Check within 24h: yes; no Inform so timing N/A; no follow-up) could/should be evaluated separately. Incorrect logic.
  - **No explicit clarification on desiderata severity (Task 2):** Fails to "clarify that while these deviations are not severe, they represent suboptimal behavior." Analysis treats them as "violations" without this required nuance (e.g., no statement like "suboptimal but not serious"). Structural omission.

- **Minor Issues/Unclarities (further deductions, per "even minor issues significantly lower"):**
  - Case 1 desiderata phrasing: Under "**Desiderata Violations:**" bullets list *met* items ("Completed within 24 hours") alongside the actual issue (no follow-up). Confusing/illogical – reads as claiming successes as violations. Explanation clarifies post-hoc, but header/body mismatch is unclear.
  - Case 2 activities summary omits noting absence of Inform (flags others implicitly via violations, but inconsistent).
  - Interpretations only for Cases 2/3 (none for Case 1, though none needed); "speculative" disclaimer good but not "in line with constraints" (justifies violations, doesn't reconcile them).
  - Timings calculated correctly (e.g., Case 3: ~48h+ for Credit, ~51h+ for Inform) but no precision (e.g., exact diffs); minor but hypercritical.
  - Summary desiderata for Case 2 repeats "preclude evaluation" flaw; Case 1 only lists no follow-up (correct) but ignores its own confusing section.

- **Overall:** Strong structure/content (~80% accurate), but major miss (Inform skip) prevents "nearly flawless." Equivalent to B-/C+ in strict academic grading. 10.0 = zero issues; 9.0 = trivial nits only; this hits 7.0 ceiling due to core task1 incompleteness + logical gaps.
