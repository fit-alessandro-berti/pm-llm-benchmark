**9.4**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (near-flawless elements)**: 
  - Perfectly targeted, open-ended ("How," "What," "Could you walk through"), conceptual focus—no SQL, no implementation details.
  - Excellent coverage of decision criteria (e.g., Q3, Q9, Q10), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q4, Q7), missing details (e.g., Q1, Q2), and exceptions (e.g., Q8, Q15, Q16)—directly maps to process stages with logical grouping.
  - Structured, comprehensive (18 questions without redundancy), professional summary sentence.
  - Uncovers stakeholder coordination, custom workflows, and improvements (Q17-18 enhance depth).

- **Minor Flaws (deducting 0.6 total)**:
  - **Timing/sequencing verification**: Weakest explicit coverage despite prompt mandate. Indirect touches (e.g., Q14 "timely resolution," Q16 "maintaining timelines") but no direct probes like "What typical durations or dependencies exist between stages (e.g., doc review to manager assignment)?" or "How do delays in one step (e.g., repairs) alter the overall sequence?". This is a logical gap in a "complex process" with noted "decision points" and "flows back and forth"—not egregious but measurably incomplete (-0.4).
  - **Hyper-minor unclarities**: Q11 assumes "volatile demand" without tying perfectly to described "market trends"; Q13's "most frequently flagged" slightly presumes data patterns. Negligible but picky (-0.1 each, combined -0.2).
  
No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or overreach—exceptionally strong overall, warranting very high score.
