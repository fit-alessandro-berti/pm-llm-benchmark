The final output is a complete, syntactically valid Python dictionary with all 45 logically possible preceding pairs (('first', 'second') where first precedes second in the given sequence SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS), exceeding the "representative subset" requirement while ensuring complexity through multi-step pairs. Keys are correctly formatted as tuples, values as (avg_time, stdev) tuples in seconds, with realistic magnitudes for a supply chain (e.g., days for procurement/receive, accumulating to weeks, ~month for AS; stdevs ~10-25% of avg, increasing with distance). Consecutive and most transitive pairs up to DT are perfectly additive (e.g., SS-OP 2d + OP-RC 5d = SS-RC 7d; holds through SS-DT 13d). 

However, deducting for logical flaws: *-AS pairs violate additivity (e.g., avg(SS,AS)=30d < avg(SS,DT)=13d + avg(DT,AS)=29d =42d, impossible for linear traces as avg(A,C) must equal avg(A,B) + avg(B,C); similar violations for PK-AS=30d  PK-DT 2d + DT-AS 29d=31d, PT-AS=30d 32d, etc.). AS stdevs are inconsistent/ad hoc. Minor arithmetic offsets (e.g., 1d discrepancies) compound this. No other inaccuracies, unclarities, or format issues. Nearly flawless structure/scope elevates score despite strict temporal inconsistency penalization.
