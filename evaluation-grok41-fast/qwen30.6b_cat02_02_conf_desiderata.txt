**4.0**

### Justification for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (why not lower, e.g., 1-3):** The answer follows the task structure (1,2,3). Correctly identifies Case 2's two explicit normative violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection). Notes desiderata as "not severe/suboptimal" per task. Provides some interpretations.
- **Major Inaccuracies/Flaws (significant deductions):**
  - **Part 1 (Normative, ~40% weight):** Misses **critical** required step "Inform Applicant" entirely skipped in Case 2 (unconditional post-Decision activity; sequence violation). Wrongly classifies Case 3 as normative violation ("Credit Check Delayed ... violating ... 'Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment'")—delay is *desideratum only*; ordering is satisfied (Credit Check Jan-14 10:00  Risk 11:00). Falsely accuses Case 3 of normative issue. No mention Case 1 complies fully.
  - **Part 2 (Desiderata, ~30% weight):** Incomplete/inaccurate. Only covers missing Follow-up Call (correct but partial). Ignores explicit timings: Case 3 Credit Check >24h post-Received; Inform >48h post-Decision (log comments highlight these). Case 2 timings not assessed (minor but adds to incompleteness). No note on Case 1 (ideally compliant).
  - **Part 3 (Interpretations, ~20% weight):** Vague/unsubstantiated. Case 3 "delayed credit check may reflect a *rushed* ... process" is illogical (delay  rushed). Case 2 "rushed process" for missing Credit Check ignores actual premature Risk Assessment. No justifications for Case 1 or missed elements (e.g., no Inform).
  - **Overall (~10%):** Unclear/missing completeness (e.g., no Case 1 baseline; desiderata timings unaddressed despite log emphasis). Logical flaws (misapplied constraints). Not "nearly flawless"—multiple material errors/omissions prevent >5. Strictness demands deduction for each.
