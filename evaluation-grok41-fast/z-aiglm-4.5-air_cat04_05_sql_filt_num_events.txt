**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Correctness (Perfect: +10/10)**: The SQL query is logically flawless and precisely solves the problem. It correctly identifies `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then retrieves *all* events (`e.*`) from only those cases via an efficient `INNER JOIN`. No duplicates, no extraneous rows, handles edge cases (e.g., cases with 0-6 events), preserves all columns, and is valid DuckDB SQL. Alternative approaches (e.g., `WHERE case_id IN (...)` or window functions) exist but are equivalent; this is optimal.
  
- **Completeness (Perfect: +10/10)**: Returns the "full set of events" as required, without unnecessary clauses (e.g., no unneeded `ORDER BY`). Fully aligns with the prompt's specs on columns, grouping, and filtering.

- **Clarity & Structure (Near-perfect: -0.3/10)**: Well-structured with Approach, Code, and Explanation sections. Readable aliases (`e`, `valid_cases`). Explanation accurately maps to query components.

- **Precision & Accuracy (Strong but flawed: -0.5/10)**: Minor but hypercritically penalized phrasing issues:
  | Issue | Description | Impact |
  |-------|-------------|--------|
  | "those 6 events" (twice) | Implies *exactly* 6 events, contradicting `<= 6` and earlier correct phrasing ("six or fewer"). Creates subtle ambiguity. | Logical imprecision; could mislead readers. |
  | "cases (those 6 events)" | Grammatically awkward; confuses "cases" with "events." | Minor unclarity. |

- **Efficiency & Extras (Bonus but unnecessary: +0/10)**: Valid notes on performance/DuckDB are accurate but not requested—neutral, no deduction.

- **Overall Flawlessness**: Query/explanation are 98% perfect, but phrasing flaws are "minor issues" warranting a "significantly lower score" per instructions (docked 0.8 total from 10.0). Not "nearly flawless" due to imprecision.
