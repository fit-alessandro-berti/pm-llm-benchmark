This query is flawless. It precisely identifies `case_id`s with 6 events via a correct `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` subquery, then returns all events (`SELECT *`) for exactly those cases using a standard `IN` filter. No inaccuracies, inefficiencies, ambiguities, or logical flaws; it fully matches the requirements in standard SQL compatible with DuckDB.
