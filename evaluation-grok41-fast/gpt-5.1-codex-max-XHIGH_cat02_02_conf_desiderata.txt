**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (Supporting High Score):**
- **Completeness and Structure**: Fully addresses all 3 task parts with clear headings. Correctly identifies normative violations exclusively in Case 2 (3 precise reasons: Risk before Credit, missing Inform Applicant [correctly noted as mandatory post-Decision], Finalize after rejection). Confirms no violations in Cases 1/3. Desiderata analysis per-case, clarifying suboptimal nature. Interpretations provided where relevant (Cases 2/3), plausible and acknowledging conflicts.
- **Accuracy on Core Facts**:
  - Normative: Spot-on sequence checks, pairwise rules (e.g., Credit before Risk), branch logic (no Finalize on reject), no skips/reversals noted accurately.
  - Desiderata: Correct timings (Case 1 compliant; Case 3 >24h/~2.75 days delays; Case 2 credit ~1.2h OK). Notes follow-up absence across all as optional/suboptimal.
  - Log fidelity: All citations match table (e.g., Case 2 timestamps, Case 3 no follow-up).
- **Logical Soundness**: No flaws in reasoning—separates strict vs. soft correctly; no overclaiming compliance where violated; interpretations are justifications (e.g., "data entry errors") without falsely excusing violations ("in any case it conflicts").
- **Clarity on Distinctions**: Explicitly states desiderata "not strict"/"suboptimal"; normative as "hard rules"/"breaches."

**Weaknesses (Deductions, Significant for Strictness):**
- **Formatting/Unclarity (-0.4)**: Case 1 normative sequence listed as "ApplicationCredit CheckRisk AssessmentLoan Decision (Approved)Inform ApplicantFinalize DocumentationClose Case"—smashed words, poor readability (minor visual flaw, but hypercritical: undermines professionalism/clarity).
- **Minor Phrasing Inaccuracy/Unclarity in Desiderata Case 2 (-0.2)**: "would have been within the 48hour window to inform... but missing for normative reasons." Hypothetical/irrelevant since *no inform occurred*; implies potential compliance if done timely, but absence violates "informed promptly" desiderata (even if primarily normative). Doesn't explicitly flag Case 2 inform as desiderata fail (unlike timings/follow-up), slightly under-identifying.
- **Consistency Nitpicks (-0.1 each, total -0.2)**: "Case1"/"Case2" (no space, vs. log "1"); "Followup Call" (no hyphen, vs. prompt/log "Follow-up"); intro "trace you provided" (log is "Event Log"). Trivial but cumulative sloppiness under hypercriticism.
- **Completeness Edge (-0.1)**: Interpretations omit Case 1 (justifiable as compliant, but task "when possible" could note lack of follow-up as resource choice). No explicit "Cases failing desiderata: 1/2/3 (follow-up); 3 (timings); 2 (inform arguably)" summary—per-case OK but less sharp.

**Why Not 10.0?** Not "nearly flawless"—formatting error alone is a clarity flaw warranting deduction; phrasing hypothetical creates tiny logical ambiguity. No major errors, so not <9.0. Adjusted from 10.0 baseline: -0.8 total.
