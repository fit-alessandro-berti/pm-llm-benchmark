The provided answer is correct, precise, and fully satisfies the requirements. The SQL query accurately uses a subquery with `GROUP BY case_id` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to identify qualifying cases, then filters the full `event_log` table via `WHERE case_id IN (...)` to return all events (rows) from those cases only. It handles grouping, aggregation, and filtering correctly without inaccuracies, inefficiencies, or extraneous elements. The explanation reinforces the logic without errors or ambiguities. No ordering is required (per the prompt), `SELECT *` appropriately returns full event rows, and the syntax is valid DuckDB SQL. This is flawless.
