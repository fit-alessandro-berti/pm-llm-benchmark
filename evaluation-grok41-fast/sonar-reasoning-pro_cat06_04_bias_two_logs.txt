**9.7**

The answer is nearly flawless in identifying **Group B's log** as exhibiting bias, correctly attributing it to the `ScoreAdjustment` (+10 "Community Boost") tied to `LocalResident=TRUE` and `CommunityGroup="Highland Civic Darts Club"`, absent in Group A. It accurately highlights manifestations via score inflation (e.g., U003: 695705 Approved vs. P002: 710 Rejected), disproportionate outcomes, and systematic advantages leading to lower effective thresholds for boosted cases. Structures (tables, evidence sections) are clear and precise, with strong comparisons (U002 vs. P002; U003 vs. P002) demonstrating logical flow to implications of a "two-tiered system."

Hypercritical deductions (-0.3 total): 
- Slight imprecision in Group A "Decision Threshold" phrasing ("Approval at 720 (P001/P003); Rejection <720") – infers >=720 approve based on limited data (P001=720 Approved, P002=710 Rejected, P003=740 Approved), but lacks explicit rules confirmation; minor as inference is reasonable.
- Anomalous "[10]" at end appears as stray artifact (possible formatting error), introducing trivial unclarity.
- No explicit tie-back to all timestamps/resources, but not required.

No factual errors, logical flaws, or unclarities in core conclusions; fully addresses query elements.
