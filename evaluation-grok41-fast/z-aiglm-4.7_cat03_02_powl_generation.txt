**10.0**

The provided code is nearly flawless and faithfully constructs the POWL model matching the scenario:

- All 11 activities (SR, CS, DA, ACI, BNC, D&R, CD, MD, QA, SA, GLA) are correctly defined as `Transition` nodes with precise, descriptive labels.
- Loop (`Operator.LOOP([BNC, D&R])`) accurately models the repeated BNC with optional D&R until stable.
- Exclusive choice (`Operator.XOR([CD, MD])`) correctly represents the deployment options.
- Top-level `StrictPartialOrder` includes exactly the right nodes: sequential singles + operators + finals.
- Edges precisely enforce dependencies:
  - `sr  cs`
  - `cs  da`, `cs  aci` (parallel after CS)
  - `da  loop`, `aci  loop` (loop after both)
  - `loop  xor`
  - `xor  qa`, `xor  sa` (parallel after XOR)
  - `qa  gla`, `sa  gla` (GLA after both)
- Concurrencies are implicit and correct (no edges between DA/ACI or QA/SA).
- No extraneous edges, nodes, silents, or operators.
- Imports, syntax, structure, and comments are impeccable; directly executable and verifiable.
