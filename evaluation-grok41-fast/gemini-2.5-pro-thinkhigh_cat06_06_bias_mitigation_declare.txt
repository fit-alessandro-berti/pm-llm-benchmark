### Hypercritical Evaluation Summary
This answer is exceptionally strong—nearly flawless in structure, relevance, format adherence, and logical coherence—but deducts minor points for hypercritical issues: (1) Inline comments within the dictionary code (e.g., "# --- BIAS MITIGATION CONSTRAINTS START ---") introduce non-standard clutter in what should be a clean, executable model representation, potentially invalidating it as "pure" Python dict for some parsers/tools; (2) Coexistence is bidirectional ("vice-versa"), but the bias rationale imperfectly justifies the reverse direction (ManualReview always implying CheckSensitiveAttribute is unnecessary/overly restrictive for fairness, as manual reviews could occur independently); (3) New activities (CheckSensitiveAttribute, ManualReview) are aptly introduced but not explicitly tied to prompt's granular examples (e.g., no "CheckApplicantRace" or "Reject_Minority"—generalization is smart but slightly less precise); (4) Rationale is "detailed" rather than strictly "brief/short" as instructed, bloating slightly; (5) Nonsuccession targets generic "FinalDecision" instead of bias-prone "Reject"/"Approve" (absent from original model, but prompt emphasizes them). These are minor but, per instructions, warrant deduction from perfection. Core task (updated model + bias-mitigating constraints + rationale) executed with precision, preserving originals flawlessly and using correct DECLARE semantics (e.g., nonsuccession forbids direct succession effectively).
