**8.2**

### Justification for Grade (for transparency, not part of response)
- **Strengths (pushing toward high score):** Perfect identification of the core anomaly (noncoexistence E,C contradicting intended E...C, with clear table and explanation of irresolvable conflict given existence(C)). Hypotheses are spot-on, varied, and exceed examples in quality/depth (5 strong ones in table). Structure is professional (tables, numbered sections, code blocks). SQL queries are syntactically flawless PostgreSQL, efficient (CTEs, window functions), and mostly target relevant checks (3.2 perfectly catches model violation via co-existence; 3.1/3.3/3.4 useful for intended flow vs. model). "How to use" section insightfully cross-analyzes results.
- **Flaws penalizing score (strict deduction):** 
  - Major inaccuracy: 3.1 comment "*If this query returns rows, the `noncoexistence(E, C)` rule is being violated*" is factually wrong—rows mean *satisfies* noncoexistence (C without E); violation requires *both* present. Logical flaw undermines credibility (~ -1.0).
  - Misses task requirement: No queries use `adjusters` table despite explicit instruction ("on the `claims`, `adjusters`, and `claim_events` tables") and example ("if evaluation steps always correspond with assigned adjusters")—3.3 checks event timing only (A before E), not correspondence (e.g., same `resource`/`adjuster_id`, matching `specialization` to `claim_type` via joins). No `claims` join either (e.g., for `claim_type`/`amount` filters) (~ -0.5).
  - Minor semantic overinterpretation: Responded_existence(AE) standardly requires E *after each A* (violation: A sans subsequent E), not strictly "E may only occur after A" (allows E before A). Query 3.3 catches E before *first* A (useful but incomplete for full violation check) (~ -0.2).
  - Unnecessary extras (3.4) dilute focus slightly, though harmless.
- **Overall:** Nearly flawless in ~80% (anomalies/hypotheses/queries utility), but inaccuracies/logical issues prevent >9.0. Rounded to 8.2 for strictness.
