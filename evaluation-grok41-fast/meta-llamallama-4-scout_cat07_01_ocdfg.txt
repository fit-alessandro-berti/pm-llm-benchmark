**9.4**

### Rationale:
- **Strengths (excellent coverage, ~94% accuracy)**:
  - Accurately identifies all major processes, sub-steps (e.g., Pack Goods, Ship Goods), object volumes (e.g., Create Order 8.5M, VendorInvoiceItem 1.2M), and durations (e.g., 450ms StartCreate Requisition, 300ms Pack Goods).
  - Correctly notes sources/flows (e.g., Send Order incoming durations: 200ms VendorInvoiceItem, 320ms ReturnOrderItem, 500ms Check Stock, 600ms Approve Payment).
  - Good structure: lists processes, objects, key observations, and business context (procurement/order fulfillment).
  - Spots largest process (Create Order 8.5M) and color-coding.

- **Minor issues (-0.6 deduction)**:
  - Wording slip: "Overall **duration** of 3.0M" for Create Requisition (3.0M is objects, not duration; ms are separate).
  - Minor ambiguity: Approve Requisition listed under Create Requisition with 5.7M objects (accurate if diagram labels it so, but flow suggests sequence, not strict sub-step).
  - No overall duration for Send Order box itself (focuses on inflows, which is fine but incomplete).

Highly effective analysis—detailed, insightful, and faithful to the diagram. Minor polish needed for precision.
