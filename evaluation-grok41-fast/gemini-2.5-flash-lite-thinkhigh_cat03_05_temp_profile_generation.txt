**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**:
  - **Format and Syntax (flawless, +2.0)**: Valid Python dictionary. Keys are correctly formatted as 2-tuples of activity labels (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`). Values are precise integer tuples `(avg_seconds, stddev_seconds)`. Comments are syntactically valid and informative (convert to days for readability), not affecting dict validity.
  - **Completeness and Complexity (strong, +2.5)**: 27 directed pairs covering direct successors (e.g., `('RC', 'QI')`, `('PT', 'PK')`) and multi-step skips (e.g., `('SS', 'DT')`, `('OP', 'WS')`), fulfilling "representative subset ... separated by multiple steps." Logical grouping by starting activity adds clarity. Covers full span from SS to AS, ~60% of possible ~45 linear pairs for 10 activities—sufficiently representative without exhaustiveness.
  - **Realism and Estimation Quality (strong, +2.0)**: Times in seconds are plausible for global supply chain (e.g., OP-RC 20 days lead time, RC-QI 1 day, DT-AS 3 days post-sale). Most chains are **additive/consistent** (e.g., SS-OP 3d + OP-RC 20d = SS-RC 23d; OP-RC 20d + RC-PK 11.5d + PK-WS 15d = OP-WS 46.5d; CA-PK 6.5d + PK-DT 22d = CA-DT 28.5d; RC-PK 11.5d + PK-DT 22d = RC-DT 33.5d). Std devs are realistic (~20-50% of mean, increasing with distance, e.g., short pairs ~0.5d std, long ~30d).
  - **Logical Ordering (good, +1.5)**: All pairs respect sequential order (earlier to later activity, no reverses/cycles). Aligns with scenario's implied linear flow (SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS).

- **Weaknesses (deducting -2.0 total, preventing 10.0)**:
  - **Critical Inaccuracy: Time Inconsistency (major logical flaw, -1.5)**: PK  DT avg=22 days, but PK  WS (15d) + WS  DT (15d) =30d. Since every trace includes PK < WS < DT (per scenario: PK packages for shipment, WS stores packaged until shipping, DT ships), `time(PK,DT) = time(PK,WS) + time(WS,DT)` **exactly per trace**, so `avg(PK,DT) MUST = avg(PK,WS) + avg(WS,DT)`. 22d < 30d violates mathematics of sequential intervals. This propagates subtly (e.g., RC-DT uses "short" PK-DT path consistently internally, but contradicts WS inclusion). Not tolerable in "temporal profile" model—even one violates "average ... times between couples."
  - **Minor Incompletenesses/Unclarities ( -0.5)**: Missing some direct/expectable pairs (e.g., no `('QI', 'CA')` ~2-4d assembly after inspection; no `('CA', 'WS')`; sparse for QI/PT outgoing). Subset OK per prompt, but gaps in core sequence (QICA direct) reduce "each pair ... that appear." No explicit handling of potential branches (prompt implies linear-ish), but unstated.
  - **No Other Flaws**: No invalid pairs, negative times, units errors, or non-sequential logic. Comments enhance without detracting.

**Overall**: Nearly flawless (structure, volume, most realism/consistency perfect), but single mathematical inconsistency is a clear logical inaccuracy warranting deduction. Hypercritical lens demands additive perfection for 9.5+; this is excellent but not "nearly flawless." Equivalent to A- work.
