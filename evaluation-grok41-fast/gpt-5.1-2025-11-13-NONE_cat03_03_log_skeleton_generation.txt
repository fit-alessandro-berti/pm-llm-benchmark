8.0

### Evaluation Summary
**Strengths (supporting high base score):**
- Correct structure: All required keys present with proper types (sets of 2-tuples for constraints, dict of sets for `activ_freq`).
- All 10 activities covered in `activ_freq` with reasonable `{1}` bounds, aligning with a mandatory linear per-order process.
- `always_before` and `always_after` accurately capture the sequential dependencies inferred from the scenario description and activity list order (physical fulfillment chain + billing chain from RO).
- `never_together` correctly empty (no mutual exclusions in scenario).
- `directly_follows` mostly aligns with the listed activity order, enforcing a strict sequence.
- Comments are helpful and demonstrate understanding of business logic.
- Python syntax is valid (inline comments in sets ignored by parser).

**Flaws (strict deductions, per hypercritical criteria):**
- **Logical flaw in `equivalence` (major deduction -1.5):** Constraints are arbitrary and not justified by scenario. Why equiv RO-IC-RP and PO-GSL-D specifically, but not e.g. RO-CA or QC-PO? No scenario evidence for these groupings (counts are already enforced by `activ_freq={1}` for all). Adds unsubstantiated constraints, bloating the model. Definition is directed ("if first, then same as second"), but chains are one-way only (no reverses like ("IC","RO") or ("RP","IC") for bidirectional equivalence), weakening intent. Comments conflate counts with temporality (e.g. "leads to/followed by" implies order, not just cardinality).
- **Logical flaw in `directly_follows` (major deduction -0.5):** Full chain assumes *immediate* succession everywhere, illogical for later steps. E.g., IC (administrative invoicing) directly after D (physical dispatch)? Scenario list order suggests sequence but not strict immediacy. RP ("once the customer pays") directly after IC ignores real-world delay/gap—payment isn't the very next event. Overly rigid for "complex" process; weaker `always_after` suffices.
- **Minor inaccuracy in `activ_freq` for RP (-0.2):** `{1}` assumes guaranteed payment, but description ("once the customer pays") hints at possible {0,1}. Scenario lists it, but strict reading allows optionality.
- **Unclarity in comments (-0.3):** `never_together` comment invents "D_unpaid" (non-existent activity), confusing/irrelevant. Equivalence comments imprecise (temporal language for count constraint).
- **Minor omission (-0.5):** No constraints handle potential parallelism (e.g., IC after PO but before/parallel to D/GSL—common in fulfillment). Linear assumption works but not "complex."

**Overall:** Strong representation of sequential process (8+ base), but unnecessary/arbitrary equivalence, illogical direct follows, and minor issues prevent "nearly flawless." Equivalent to B-grade work: functional but with clear modeling errors under scrutiny. 10.0 requires zero inferential stretches, perfect motivation for every constraint.
