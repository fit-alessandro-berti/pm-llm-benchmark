The answer is nearly flawless: comprehensive, logically structured, precisely references the normative description (with direct quotes), accurately interprets branch logic and constraints (e.g., strict sequencing post-Check, no fulfillment after Cancel, preconditions for each step), identifies all violations correctly (Cases 2, 3, 5), explains them clearly without over- or under-interpreting ambiguities, uses tables for clarity, and provides a crisp summary/final answer matching the task. No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or flaws—even under hypercritical scrutiny, every claim holds (e.g., Case 3's Authorize-then-Cancel correctly flagged as violating implied sufficiency branch; Case 2/5 sequencing errors precisely pinned). Conforming cases (1/4) validated perfectly.
