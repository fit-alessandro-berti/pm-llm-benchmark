**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It delivers precisely 12 targeted, open-ended questions that systematically address all specified goals: uncovering missing details (e.g., Q2 on frequent documentation issues), decision criteria (e.g., Q3 on manager weighting, Q7 on tenant selection), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q10 on handoffs), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q1 on timelines, Q9 on review parallelism), and exceptions (e.g., Q5, Q8). Questions are conceptually focused, directly tied to the process description with accurate references (e.g., "You mentioned..." phrasing), and avoid any SQL, code, or technical implementation requests—Q6 probes pricing conceptually via data sources/tools in a process-oriented way, aligning with the description's mention of "internal pricing models" without crossing into execution details.

No inaccuracies (all questions logically derive from the narrative), unclarities (each is precise and unambiguous), or logical flaws (comprehensive coverage without redundancy or irrelevance; extends logically to post-onboarding feedback in Q11 and changes in Q12 as valid "missing details"). Minor rendering artifacts (e.g., "â—" encoding) are ignorable as non-substantive. The reflective closing sentence reinforces adherence without excess. This meets "nearly flawless" criteria for maximum score.
