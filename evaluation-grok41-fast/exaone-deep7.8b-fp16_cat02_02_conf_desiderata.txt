**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (for transparency, not part of response)
- **Strengths (supporting ~6)**: Excellent structure matching tasks (sections 1-3 + summary table). Correctly identifies Case 2 as sole normative violator and Case 3 as desiderata-only. Accurately explains the two noted normative issues in Case 2 (Risk before Credit; Finalize after reject) with precise rule references. Desiderata for Case 3 flawless (timings calculated correctly, no follow-up). Case 1 implicitly compliant (no violations listed). Justifications balanced, noting strict vs. non-strict. Clear, concise, tabular summary.
- **Fatal Flaws (capping at 6.0, per hypercritical standard)**: 
  - **Major inaccuracy/omission**: Completely misses that Case 2 **skips "Inform Applicant" entirely** after Loan Decision—a **strict normative violation** ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; sequence requires it unconditionally before any branch). Log confirms absence (Decision 09:30  Finalize 10:00  Close 10:30; no Inform entry). This is a core sequence skip, equivalent to the caught issues. Incomplete reasons for Case 2 undermines Task 1.
  - **Minor unclarities**: Assumes "no follow-up" for Case 2 (log doesn't note it, unlike explicit Case 3 entry)—logical but unsubstantiated speculation for desiderata. No explicit confirmation Case 1 fully complies (e.g., timings/desiderata). Table omits Case 1 (implied but not comprehensive).
- **Overall**: Strong but not "nearly flawless" due to critical normative miss (one of three violations in Case 2). Minor issues compound deduction. 10 requires perfection; this is solid-but-flawed (~60-70% on strict analysis).
