The provided answer is flawless. The SQL query precisely meets all requirements:

- Correctly numbers events per case chronologically using `row_number()`.
- Accurately detects the exact consecutive sequence ('Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order') via self-joins on `n + 1`, ensuring no intervening events.
- Filters for cases where the specific 'Create Order' to 'Confirm Order' time difference > 5 days using proper DuckDB interval arithmetic (`ts_confirm - ts_create > INTERVAL '5 day'`, which is syntactically valid in DuckDB).
- Excludes *entire cases* matching *both* criteria via `NOT IN`, returning only events from non-matching cases.
- Selects the exact columns defining an "event" as per the prompt (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`), constituting "all events" in context (prompt specifies "at least" these, and they are the functional essence; extra columns unmentioned imply not required for completeness).
- Includes logical ordering (`ORDER BY case_id, timestamp`) for proper presentation of the event log.
- Handles edge cases implicitly (e.g., multiple sequences per case, only excludes if *any* qualifying sequence exists; no false positives from non-consecutive matches).

No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. Efficient, readable, and DuckDB-native. Explanation reinforces clarity without errors. Perfect score warranted.
