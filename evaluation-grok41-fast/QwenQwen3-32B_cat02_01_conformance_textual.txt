The answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It correctly identifies exactly the violating cases (2, 3, 5) with no misses or false positives. Explanations precisely reference the normative description's rules (e.g., authorization before packaging, no fulfillment after cancellation, packaging mandatory before shipping) without inaccuracies or overinterpretation. Case 3's explanation focuses on the explicit "never after cancellation" constraint, which is unambiguous and sufficient; additional inferences (e.g., authorization implying sufficiency) are not required for flagging the deviation. Structures (lists, sequences, table, interpretations) are clear, logical, and comprehensive. No unclarities, flaws, or omissions impact the conclusions.
