The response is exemplary: precise duration calculations (all verified accurate to within minutes, with approximations clearly flagged and contextually appropriate); flawless identification of problematic cases (2002, 2003, 2005) with quantified multiples relative to low-complexity baseline; rigorous attribute analysis correctly prioritizing Complexity (primary driver via doc requests) over Resource (no poor performers, appropriate specialization noted) and Region (minor, evidence-based); detailed timestamp breakdowns expose exact bottlenecks (e.g., 20-30h cycles); explanations mechanistically sound (iterative requests compound customer/system waits, overnight gaps); recommendations prioritized, actionable, directly tied to causes (e.g., upfront checklists target iterations, portal SLAs address waits), with realistic quantified impacts. Structure enhances clarity (tables, summaries); fully addresses all tasks without omissions, speculation, or fluff. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws detected under hypercritical scrutiny.
