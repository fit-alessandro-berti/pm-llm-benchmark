**9.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong overall—structured, comprehensive, and directly aligned with the prompt's requirements—but deducts 1 point for a logical flaw in grouping coherence (detailed below). No factual inaccuracies (e.g., all events correctly mapped, timestamps/durations precisely calculated), no unclarities (tables are crisp, rationales explicit), and exceeds basics with case-specific applications and durations. Minor polish issues (e.g., unaddressed inter-step gaps) are negligible under strictness but do not warrant further deduction.

#### Strengths (Supporting High Score):
- **Complete Coverage & Consistency**: All 12 low-level events per case grouped without omission or invention. Identical patterns across A1/B2 handled perfectly.
- **Rationale Quality**: Each grouping justified logically via shared objectives (e.g., "preparatory... physical and thermal state"), temporal proximity, and process phase. Ties to prompt criteria (temporal closeness, logical sequence).
- **Naming**: Domain-relevant and descriptive (e.g., "Core Assembly (Welding)" precisely captures transformation).
- **Output Format**: Exemplary—tables for proposals and mappings, with start/end timestamps and durations (accurately computed, e.g., A1 Step 1: 08:00:20 - 08:00:05 = 15s). Structured and scannable.
- **Goal Achievement**: Reduces 12 events to 4 steps, enables "at-a-glance" workflow analysis (e.g., bottleneck focus in conclusion).
- **No Extraneous Issues**: No hallucinations, ignores irrelevant details (e.g., AdditionalInfo not overused), handles multi-case inference as instructed.

#### Deductions (Strict Hypercriticism):
- **Logical Flaw in Grouping (Step 3: -1.0)**: "Initial Quality Check & Surface Treatment" mashes distinct phases—instant post-weld **inspection** ("Measure weld integrity" by Quality Sensor, akin to prompt's "Quality Inspection" example) with **manufacturing finishing** ("Apply protective coating," "Dry coating" by Coating/Heating Units). This violates "coherent stage" criterion: integrity check verifies prior assembly (belongs with Step 2 or standalone QC), while coating/drying is transformative protection. Compound name ("Quality Check & Surface Treatment") exposes the incoherence, splitting quality events illogically (measure "initial," visual "final") instead of unifying inspections or separating manufacturing from QA. Alternative (e.g., Assembly incl. measure; separate Coating; unified Inspection) would be flawless. This is not "subjective"—prompt emphasizes "logical groupings" (e.g., component prep, QA separate), making it a core imperfection.
- **Minor Nit (No Score Impact)**: Inter-step gaps (e.g., 40s post-preheat) unmentioned; could note as "idle/transition" for perfection, but not required.

Nearly flawless (9+ territory); flaw prevents 10.0. Rescore to 10.0 only on regrouping Step 3.
