**9.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
**Strengths (driving high score):**
- **Comprehensive merging and enrichment**: All events from both logs are included without loss or duplication. Merged events sensibly combine attributes (e.g., ts_B, user_id, resource_id, notes from B; primary event_type/name from A where matched). Unmatched handled correctly with origin flags and placeholders (—).
- **Chronological order**: Perfectly sorted using per-event primary timestamps (A for merged/A-only, B for B-only).
- **Output format**: Clear, readable, tabular-like presentation with consistent fields. Implicit/explicit src handling is elegant.
- **Reasoning structure**: Well-organized sections (matching logic, attributes). Documents diffs, semantics, positions explicitly. Acknowledges name variations (e.g., spacing/case) and single-candidate logic.
- **Semantic alignment**: Excellent judgment on "same activity" (e.g., OrderReceived/Order Received, Shipping/Item Shipped). Positions align sequentially.
- **Primary timeline respect**: Uses A ts as primary for merged/A-only, reasonable for B-only.

**Flaws/Deductions (strict, even minor  significant impact):**
- **Tolerance inconsistency (major logical flaw, -0.5)**: States "Tolerance window: ±2 s for all events" (<=> |diff|  2s), but matches Payment at **5s diff** ("just outside"), overriding with "only one payment-handling event." Prompt specifies "<2 seconds" (strictly <2s) as example for confidence; 5s exceeds "slightly offset by a few seconds or milliseconds." This arbitrary override undermines "confidently match" rule—should leave separate or expand tolerance globally/reason better (e.g., positional + semantic primacy). Names also imperfect ("Payment Processed" vs. "PaymentCheck"—check  processed semantically).
- **Borderline diffs not <2s strictly (-0.2)**: Received (exactly 2s), Shipped (exactly 2s). Prompt: "less than 2 seconds" (= not ). Minor, as "e.g." + "combination" allows leeway, but hyperstrict: violates literal tolerance.
- **Primary ts claim minor inaccuracy (-0.1)**: States "Primary timestamp chosen from System A" universally, but #4 (B-only) uses B's ts as main line item ts (no ts_A field). Implicitly fine (no A ts exists), but wording inconsistent with execution.
- **No harmonized event names (-0)**: Keeps originals (good, as not required), but minor unclarity in merged records (e.g., #3 uses A's "Payment Processed" despite weak match).

**Overall**: Nearly flawless execution (95%+ adherence), but tolerance override is a clear logical inconsistency in self-stated rules, warranting deduction. No other major gaps; superior to typical responses. High score reflects excellence despite hypercriticism.
