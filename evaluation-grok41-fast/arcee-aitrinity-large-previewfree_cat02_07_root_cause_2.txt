**8.2**

### Strengths (why not lower):
- **Correct identification of key cases (Task 1)**: Accurately flags 2003 and 2005 as clear outliers with multi-day durations, contrasting them effectively against faster cases. This is precise and data-driven.
- **Solid analysis of attributes (Task 2)**: Correctly dismisses Region (spans A/B in both fast/slow) and Resources (e.g., Lisa's mixed performance) as non-factors. Pinpoints Complexity as dominant via multiple doc requests—only highs have >1 request (2003: 2; 2005: 3), driving delays. Logical correlations are sound.
- **Explanations and mitigations (Task 3)**: Plausible root causes (poor upfront guidance, slow doc fulfillment) tied directly to data patterns. Suggestions (checklists, SLAs) are practical, targeted, and process-relevant.

### Critical Flaws (hypercritical deductions, each costing ~0.5-1.0):
- **Inaccuracy on durations**: Claims "low- and medium-complexity cases that finish within a single day." False for 2002 (Medium, B): Submit 2024-04-01 09:05 to Close 2024-04-02 11:00 (~26 hours, spans 2 days; single Request + overnight delay to Approve). Groups it erroneously with lows (all <2 hours, same day), blurring "significantly longer" threshold. Undermines precision.
- **Factual error on 2003 timeline**: "In case 2003, there are two such requests with a full day in between." False—both Requests on 2024-04-01 (11:00 then 17:00, ~6 hours apart, same day). Delay is post-Requests to Approve (Apr-02 16:00, ~23 hours later). Misrepresents pattern, weakening causality claim.
- **Incomplete quantification**: No exact lead times (e.g., 2001: ~1.5h; 2002: ~26h; 2003: ~48h; 2004: ~1.5h; 2005: ~121h). Qualitative only; "several days" vague (2003 is ~2 calendar days). Strict analysis demands metrics for "significantly longer."
- **Minor unclarities/logical gaps**: Doesn't note 2002's moderate delay (1 Request, like highs but fewer) could hint at early Complexity signal, or resource subtleties (e.g., Mike/Lisa handle all Requests; Bill approves longs vs. Ann fasts). Over-relies on "multiple rounds" without quantifying wait times between events. No table/visual summary for clarity.

Nearly strong (addresses all tasks, data-faithful overall), but factual errors and omissions prevent 9+. Flawless requires zero inaccuracies, full metrics, airtight logic.
