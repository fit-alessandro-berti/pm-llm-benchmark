**9.7**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Comprehensiveness and Coverage (Strength, +2.5/3)**: Excellently maps to all required areas (missing details, decision criteria, roles, timing/sequencing, exceptions). Covers every process stage from the description (documentation to audits) plus logical extensions like communication/tools and bottlenecks without straying into SQL/tech implementation. Minor deduction (-0.5) for Category 10 slightly extrapolating beyond core onboarding (e.g., long-term manager metrics post-activation), though tied to described "track record."
  
- **Open-Ended Nature (Near-Flawless, +2.4/2.5)**: 95%+ purely open-ended ("What specific...", "How does...", "Who is responsible..."). The few with "Are there any situations/scenarios..." (e.g., 2.1, 7.2, 9.1) are borderline leading/yes-no prompts that invite elaboration but technically deviate from ideal open-endedness by implying binary existence before description. Hypercritical: this is a minor logical flaw in phrasing consistency.

- **Targeted and Conceptual Depth (Strength, +2.5/2.5)**: Precisely probes nuances (e.g., prioritization criteria, repair processes, custom clauses) aligned to description's gaps (e.g., no specifics on tools, inspector selection, bottlenecks). No inaccuracies or assumptions contradicting the process. Enhances conceptual understanding without hypotheticals or overreach.

- **Clarity, Structure, and Precision (Flawless, +2.3/2.5)**: Bullet-point categories with bold headers make it scannable and logical. Questions are concise, non-repetitive, jargon-free. Closing summary perfectly restates goals. Tiny deduction (-0.2) for one phrasing ("despite not being a perfect fit" in 2.1 assumes imperfection, mildly presumptive but not inaccurate).

- **Overall Flawlessness (High, but not Absolute)**: No major inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws; ignores <think> as instructed. Total questions (~20) form a "series" without excess verbosity. Deduction only for the 2-3 semi-closed phrasings and slight scope stretch—prevents perfect 10.0 under "utmost strictness."
