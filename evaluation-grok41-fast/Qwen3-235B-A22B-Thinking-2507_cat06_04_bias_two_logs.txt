**10.0**

The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It precisely identifies **Group B's log** as exhibiting bias, with accurate, evidence-based analysis directly tied to the data (e.g., U003's 695  705 approved vs. P002's 710 rejected). All required elements are addressed without omission: LocalResident (FALSE for A, TRUE for B), CommunityGroup (None for A, selective for B), ScoreAdjustment (+10 "Community Boost" exclusive to B's affiliated cases), and systematic differences (lower effective threshold for B via boosts, leading to disparate decisions). Explanations are logical, structured (tables, steps), clear, and free of contradictions. The minor phrasing on "15 points lower" is precisely illustrative (710 - 695 = 15 on prelim basis) and contextually accurate, not a flaw. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or extraneous errors; conclusions are robust and directly responsive.
