**Grade: 1.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Summary
This response fails catastrophically on nearly every criterion of the target prompt (identify **specific** anomalies in the **given event log data**, hypothesize causes, propose tailored SQL queries for further investigation). It is a generic, off-topic "toolkit" of prompts and buggy SQL, ignoring the provided sample data entirely. No analysis of cases 1001–1004 (e.g., 1002's pre-credit shipment, 1003's post-shipment confirmation/invoice, 1004's payment-first chaos, low credit in 1002). Zero hypotheses (e.g., no speculation on race conditions, overrides, or DB inserts). SQL "examples" are riddled with errors (logic flaws, syntax issues, broken JOINs, wrong columns)—unrunnable in PostgreSQL. Structure misaligns as meta-prompts "to ask the LLM," not direct analysis/queries. Even minor wins (e.g., query #2, #6, #9 partially work) are drowned by pervasive flaws. Utterly unusable; scores only above 1.0 for vaguely anomaly-themed topics.
