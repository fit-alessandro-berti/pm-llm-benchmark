**10.0**

The provided answer delivers a flawless execution of the prompt. It produces a comprehensive, logically organized list of 20 targeted, open-ended questions that precisely address all specified goals: uncovering missing details (e.g., Q10, Q13), decision criteria (e.g., Q4-6), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q7-9), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q1-3), and exception handling (e.g., Q10-12, Q17). Thematic grouping enhances usability without redundancy. Every question is conceptual, avoids any technical/SQL/implementation references, faithfully derives from the process description, encourages elaboration/examples, and probes tacit knowledge (e.g., frustrations, workarounds). Phrasing is precise, non-leading, and interviewer-friendly. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or even minor deviations—pure excellence.
