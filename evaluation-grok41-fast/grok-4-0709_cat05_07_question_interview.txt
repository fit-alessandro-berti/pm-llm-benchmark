### Evaluation Summary
This answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It fully adheres to the prompt by delivering a precise list of 14 targeted, open-ended questions that systematically probe missing details (e.g., Q1, Q2), decision criteria (e.g., Q3, Q6, Q8, Q9), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q1, Q12), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q5, Q13, Q14), and exceptions (e.g., Q4, Q6, Q9, Q12). Coverage spans all major process stages without gaps or irrelevancies, directly mapping to the description (e.g., documentation  Q1-2; assignment  Q3-4; inspection/marketing  Q5-7; activation/screening  Q8-10; audits  Q11; overall  Q12-14). No SQL, implementation details, or off-topic elements. Questions are conceptually deepening, phrased naturally for an interview, logically grouped for clarity (enhancing usability without violating prompt), and free of inaccuracies, ambiguities, redundancies, or logical flaws—even minor phrasing issues are absent (e.g., all avoid yes/no traps, use precise language tied to description). Intro concisely justifies design without excess. No deductions warranted.
