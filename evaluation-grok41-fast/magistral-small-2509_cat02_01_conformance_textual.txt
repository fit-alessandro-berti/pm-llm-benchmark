The answer correctly identifies exactly the violating cases (2, 3, 5) with no false positives or misses. Explanations are precise, directly tied to the normative description's constraints (e.g., sequencing rules for Authorize/Package/Ship, no Ship after Cancel, no deviations like late Cancel after Authorize), and handle interpretation of implied conditions (e.g., Authorize implies sufficient inventory, making later Cancel inconsistent) without overreaching or ambiguity. Structure is clear and task-compliant. No inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities.
