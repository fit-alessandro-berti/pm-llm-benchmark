**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (limited):** Correctly identifies 3 key anomalies from the profile (RP low STDEV, PN long/high STDEV, AC short time), with accurate time conversions (e.g., 90000s=25h). Hypotheses are plausible and aligned with prompt suggestions (e.g., batching, backlogs, skipping steps). Structure independently presents anomalies, reasons, and queries without referencing instructions. Covers some prompt examples.

- **Major Flaws (severely penalizing):**
  - **SQL Queries Fundamentally Broken (fatal inaccuracy, ~40% score deduction):** All 3 queries reference non-existent `activity_next` column (schema has no such column; events are per-row with `activity`, requiring LAG(), LEAD(), self-joins, or ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) to compute intervals). Queries fail to calculate *actual time differences* (e.g., no `timestamp2 - timestamp1` or Z-score vs. profile thresholds). No filtering for deviations (e.g., `WHERE diff_seconds > avg + 3*stdev`). No GROUP BY or aggregations for per-claim diffs. Results would be empty/irrelevant:
    | Query | Specific Issues |
    |-------|-----------------|
    | 1     | No `activity_next`; unjoined `submission_date` (from `claims` table); meaningless EXTRACTs (e.g., `receive_time` on all 'R' timestamps?); doesn't compute RP diff or flag outliers. |
    | 2     | No `activity_next`; MIN/MAX on mismatched activities (WHERE mixes 'P' AND 'N'—impossible); no time diff calc; irrelevant ORDER BY. |
    | 3     | No `activity_next`; COUNT(DISTINCT activity) under wrong WHERE (filters 'A' events only?); doesn't check AC time or skipping (needs full trace per claim). |
  - **Incomplete Anomaly Coverage (-1.0):** Misses other profile oddities (e.g., EN unrealistically short 5min/1min STDEV; AC 2h suspiciously quick vs. full flow; RE 1day ok but not contextualized). Prompt demands "note where average times are suspiciously short or long, or STDEV unusually small/large"—only partial.
  - **No Correlations as Required (-1.5):** Prompt explicitly requires queries correlating anomalies to "adjusters, claim types, resources, customer/region" (joins to `claims`, `adjusters` via `claim_id`, `resource`?). Zero joins, no GROUP BY adjuster_id/resource/claim_type.
  - **Logical/Conceptual Flaws (-0.8):** Queries don't "identify specific claims where time falls outside expected ranges" (no thresholds/ZETA). Hypotheses generic, not tied to data (e.g., no "manual entry" or "automated skips" from prompt). AC hypothesis assumes "without intermediate steps" but query doesn't verify (counts wrong activities).
  - **Unclarities/Minors (-0.5):** Vague phrasing (e.g., Query1's "submission_day/year" irrelevant); no full SQL validity (e.g., ambiguous `activity_next`); incomplete conclusion (claims queries "pinpoint...deviations" but they can't).

- **Overall:** Tasks ~60% met (anomalies/hypotheses ok), but verification (SQL) is unusable garbage—core failure. Not "nearly flawless"; strictness demands low score for broken core output.
