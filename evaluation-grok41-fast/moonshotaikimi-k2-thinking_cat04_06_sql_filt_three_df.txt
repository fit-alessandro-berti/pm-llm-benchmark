**10.0**

The provided SQL query is correct, complete, and precisely meets all requirements:

- **Sequence detection**: Uses `LEAD(activity, 1)` and `LEAD(activity, 2)` over `(PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)` to accurately identify cases with the exact consecutive sequence `'Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order'`, ensuring no intervening events via direct row adjacency in the ordered partition.
- **Timing filter**: Correctly computes `next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'` (valid DuckDB syntax; timestamp subtraction yields interval for comparison), applied only to qualifying sequences.
- **Case exclusion**: `DISTINCT case_id` captures any case with 1 matching sequence/timing pair; final `WHERE case_id NOT IN (...)` excludes *all events* from those cases, returning all others.
- **Output**: `SELECT *` from `event_log`, with appropriate `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` for stable, logical presentation (enhances usability without altering semantics).
- **Structure**: Efficient CTE with named `WINDOW`, clear comments, no redundant computations, handles edge cases (e.g., insufficient events  `LEAD` NULL  no match; multiple sequences/cases handled via `DISTINCT`).

No inaccuracies, ambiguities, inefficiencies, or logical flaws. DuckDB-compatible and robust (assumes standard timestamp ordering stability, as unspecified).
