The final answer correctly identifies and groups all 18 events into exactly three distinct cases using the invariant attributes `patient_age` and `patient_gender` as the unique patient signatures, with no misassignments, omissions, or extras. Each case's event sequence is chronologically ordered, logically coherent (e.g., Case 1: registration  triage  imaging  diagnosis matching the imaging  discharge; Case 2: includes lab request-completion cycle leading to infection diagnosis and antibiotics; Case 3: full elective surgery workflow), and department-consistent where applicable. Profiles, logics, and event listings are precise, verifiable against the log (timestamps/activities/departments/ages/genders match exactly), and presented in a clear, structured format without ambiguities or flaws.
