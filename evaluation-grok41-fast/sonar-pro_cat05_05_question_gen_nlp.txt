The response is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It delivers exactly 20 open-ended, thought-provoking questions directly grounded in or insightfully extending the described supply chain process (e.g., R&D, multi-country sourcing, assembly in Malaysia, logistics, quality/compliance, digital systems, forecasting, sustainability). All questions emphasize insights, issues, improvements, and implications as required, with no yes/no formats, SQL queries, or extraneous content. Wording is precise, relevant (no off-topic drifts, even in forward-looking ones like modular design or 3D printing, which logically tie to product design, manufacturing evolution, and continuous improvement), and free of inaccuracies, unclarities, ambiguities, repetitions, or logical gaps. The brief introductory phrase aids clarity without violating "just list the questions." No minor flaws detected.
