The provided answer is an exceptionally accurate, complete, and concise textual description of the image's three parts (a, b, c). It faithfully captures all key elements: process flows and roles, channel connections (Order system, HIS), BPMN-style loops/conditions, UML class diagram with correct "requires" association and multiplicities (1 lab visit  1..* lab tests; each lab test  1 lab visit), and the exact performative table structure/content. No omissions, errors, or extraneous details.
