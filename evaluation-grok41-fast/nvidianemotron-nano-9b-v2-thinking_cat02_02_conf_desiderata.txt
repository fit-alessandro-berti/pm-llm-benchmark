**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (why not lower):** Perfect structure matching all 3 tasks. Correctly identifies Case 2's two explicit normative violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection) with precise timestamps and rule references. Accurately states Case 3 has no normative violations (sequence intact). Desiderata timings for Case 3 precisely calculated (49 hours for Credit Check; ~51 hours/"48 hours and 3 hours" for Inform Applicant—minor phrasing ambiguity but numerically correct). Flags no Follow-up Call correctly for Cases 2/3 as desiderata failures. Provides interpretations/ justifications as required, tied to behaviors. Case 1 implicitly handled correctly (no violations listed). Summary concise and accurate *except* for the miss below. Ignores think tag per instructions.
- **Major Flaws (significant deductions):**
  - **Critical normative inaccuracy (primary reason for low score):** Completely misses that **Case 2 skips "Inform Applicant" entirely**—a strict normative violation. Log shows Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30  Finalize Documentation at 10:00  Close Case at 10:30, with *no Inform Applicant ever*. This violates: (1) sequence ("Loan Decision  Inform Applicant"); (2) "applicant must be informed of the outcome"; (3) "no skipping activities." Explicitly "not allowed." No mention anywhere, despite table comment only on other issues. This is a *core* sequence skip, undermining Task 1 completeness.
  - **Desiderata inconsistency:** Flags "No Follow-up Call" only for Cases 2/3, but log shows *none* in Case 1 either (not listed, like Case 3's explicit note). All cases fail this desideratum ("encouraged... before closing"). Omitting Case 1 creates logical flaw/unclarity in "which cases fail."
  - **Minor unclarities:** Desiderata for Case 2 only lists Follow-up (ignores that skipped Inform precludes "promptly inform within 48 hours," though arguably normative). Interpretations for Case 2 speculative ("misunderstanding") without tying to *all* violations. Case 3 normative says "sequence... is correct" but doesn't explicitly confirm full order (e.g., Inform before Finalize)—verbose but not wrong.
- **Overall:** Not "nearly flawless"—major omission of key violation (skipped mandatory step) is a logical flaw/inaccuracy warranting sharp penalty under "utmost strictness." Equivalent to ~60-70% accuracy on Task 1; strong elsewhere pulls to 4.0.
