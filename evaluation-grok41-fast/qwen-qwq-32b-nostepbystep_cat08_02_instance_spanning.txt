**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting ~8+ base)**: Comprehensive coverage of all 5 sections with clear structure. Practical strategies with data leverage. Good interaction analysis. Simulation and monitoring detailed and relevant. Differentiation concept solid overall.
- **Major Deductions**:
  - **Factual Inaccuracy (Process Flow, -1.5)**: Section 1.1 incorrectly states prior activity to Packing as "e.g., Quality Check." Log/snippet clearly shows Item Picking  Packing  Quality Check  Shipping. Critical error for process mining (misidentifies dependencies); undermines "ready time" calculations.
  - **Logical Flaw in Strategy (Interaction Misalignment, -0.8)**: Strategy 2 ties batch splitting to ">10 hazardous orders" directly, but batching occurs *post-QC* (after hazardous-limited steps). No direct impact on simultaneous Packing/QC count; batches process sequentially/individually earlier. Ignores true interaction (e.g., batch delays don't retro-cause Packing queues).
  - **Unrigorous Mining Techniques (-0.8)**: Lacks specifics like process discovery (DFG/Petri nets for bottlenecks), time-window aggregation for concurrency (e.g., sliding windows for hazardous counts/queues), or conformance checking for priority preemption detection. "Flagged in log" for pauses assumes unlogged events. Queue lengths/utilization vaguely described without log-derived methods (e.g., resource-event overlap queries).
  - **Speculative/Unsupported Claims (-0.5)**: Outcomes like "30% reduction" arbitrary, not tied to historical baselines or sim projections. Undermines "data-driven."
  - **Incomplete Differentiation (-0.4)**: Per-constraint but inconsistent (e.g., no formula for "earliest possible start" accounting for all deps; hazardous needs concurrency reconstruction). Repeated/moved to extra Section 6 disrupts.
  - **Minor Issues (-0.3 total)**: Extraneous table/Section 6/Summary violate "separate sections" structure. Priority metrics assume detectable "pauses" without log evidence. No deep process mining principles (e.g., social/resource networks for contention).
- **Overall**: Strong framework but flaws in accuracy/logic/rigor prevent >8.0. "Nearly flawless" requires zero such issues.
