**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (for transparency, not part of response)
- **Strengths (boosting score):** Excellent structure with clear step-by-step flow, strong coverage of real-world motivations (regulatory, fraud, risk, ops, customer), speculative consequences well-linked to violations, good summary. Groups constraints logically into steps and key section. Covers core sequence (init, response, succession, altsuccession, precedence, coexistence, chain*, alt*, nonco*) mostly accurately. Implications and examples practical and insightful.
- **Weaknesses (strict penalties):** 
  - **Major logical flaw/inaccuracy (-2.0):** Step-by-step flow violates `chainsuccession` (Quality_Assurance_Review directly/strictly to Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package), as Authorize_Contract_Terms is inserted between (step 4  5  6). Process description claims alignment but breaks it, undermining "ensures... logically ordered manner."
  - **Incomplete constraint coverage (-0.5):** Omits `existence` (must occur), `exactly_one` (Credit_Check once only), `absence` (forbidden activity) in steps (briefly later), `responded_existence`, `chainprecedence`, `nonsuccession`, `nonchainsuccession`, `noncoexistence` not explicitly tied to steps/flow (glossed or implied only). Request asks to discuss "each of the constraints."
  - **Minor unclarities/inaccuracies (-0.3):** Coexistence described as "parallel workflows" (actually just mutual existence, not order/timing). Noncoexistence (Transfer_Funds & Receive_Application never co-occur) logically conflicts with process (Receive exists, so Transfer impossible?), unaddressed. Flow linearizes potentially parallel elements rigidly.
- **Overall:** Comprehensive and professional, but core flow inaccuracy + gaps prevent "nearly flawless." Hypercritical adjustment from ~9.0 base to 7.2.
