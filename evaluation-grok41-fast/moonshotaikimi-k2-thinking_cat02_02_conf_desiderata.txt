**9.8**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Near-Flawless Elements):**
  - **Task Coverage (Complete and Precise):** Fully addresses all 3 tasks. Normative violations correctly identified only for Case 2 (3 issues: order reversal, missing mandatory Inform Applicant, post-rejection documentation—**all accurate per rules**). Case 1 and 3 correctly cleared of normative issues. Desiderata failures listed per case with explicit clarification of "not serious"/"minor"/"suboptimal" (e.g., "not a serious violation", "suboptimal but permissible"). Interpretations/justifications provided where relevant (Cases 2–3), aligned with constraints (e.g., data errors, operational delays), without fabricating compliance.
  - **Accuracy:** Zero factual errors. Timestamps validated correctly (e.g., Case 2: 08:20 Risk before 09:00 Credit; Case 3: 49h/51h calculations precise). Missing Inform Applicant in Case 2 correctly flagged as normative (rules mandate it post-decision). All sequences/precedences checked exhaustively.
  - **Clarity and Structure:** Exemplary—uses bold headings, numbered lists, table for distinction, timestamps for evidence. Concise yet comprehensive; no verbosity in conclusions.
  - **Logical Soundness:** Distinguishes severity perfectly (table reinforces). Bottom Line adds value without overstepping. Self-contained; ignores think tag as instructed.

- **Minor Deductions (Hypercritical Penalties, Total -0.2):**
  - **Slight Over-Interpretation in Case 2 (-0.1):** Suggests "intentional shortcut (e.g., a silent rejection)" as possible—logical, but speculatively ascribes motive ("intentional") without log evidence, bordering on unsubstantiated narrative. Strictly, justifications should stick closer to "data entry error/system glitch" (already strong) without implying intent.
  - **Incomplete Desiderata for Case 1 (-0.1):** Notes missing Follow-up Call but omits explicit timing checks (though compliant, e.g., "2 hours" implicitly OK). Task requires identifying *all* desiderata failures; verbose parallelism across cases would be flawless (e.g., "Credit Check: within 24h ; Inform: within 48h ").
  
No major inaccuracies/unclarities/flaws warrant lower score. Response is production-grade; 10.0 reserved for zero nits.
