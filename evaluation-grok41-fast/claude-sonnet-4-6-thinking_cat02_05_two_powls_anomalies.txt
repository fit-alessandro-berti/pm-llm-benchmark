**9.7**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—thorough, logically sound, well-structured with diagrams/tables/code snippets, and directly addresses all task elements (analysis, anomalies by severity, comparison/justification). It correctly interprets POWL semantics (StrictPartialOrder requires all top-level nodes in every trace as linear extensions; operators like LOOP/XOR introduce optionality/internal silents; partial orders allow interleaving where undefined). Anomalies are precisely identified with business logic ties (e.g., payroll integrity). Verdict is defensible: Model 1 mandates *all* labeled activities (no skips), with only precedence flaw; Model 2 permits Payroll omission (logically invalid) and ineffective Screening.

**Minor Deductions (strictly applied, preventing 10.0):**
- **Unclarity in diagrams (0.2 deduction):** Model 1 reconstruction "Post Screen { Decide Interview } Decide Onboard..." redundantly repeats "Decide" post-brace, risking misread as duplication rather than illustrative flow. Model 2 "Post Screen ... Post Interview" mildly repetitive/awkward phrasing.
- **Omission of Interview dead-end in Model 1 (0.1 deduction):** Highlights no `Interview  Decide` correctly but underplays Interview's lack of successors (parallel dead-end like Model 2's Screen), weakening "post-hire sequence intact" claim slightly—it's intact *post-Decide*, but Interview dangles ineffectively.
- **Slight overstatement in Model 2 Loop (0.0 net, but noted):** "Onboarding may repeat unnecessarily" accurate (LOOP(Onboard, skip) permits 1 Onboard via silent loops), but doesn't note minimum-1 guarantee (vs. Payroll's true optionality), minor nuance gap.

No factual errors, logical flaws, or task misses. Hyper-polished; flaws are cosmetic/sub-subtle.
