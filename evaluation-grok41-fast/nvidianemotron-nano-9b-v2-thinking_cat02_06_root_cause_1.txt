**6.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: Correctly identifies outlier cases (102, 104, 105) matching task 1. Logical structure mirrors tasks 1-3. Accurate per-case breakdowns of delays/escalations/investigation durations (e.g., 19h investigation patterns, specific gaps like 2.5h/4h). Good causal links (escalations, idle times, prolonged investigations).
- **Major Flaws Penalizing Score**:
  - **Factual inaccuracy in core data (task 1)**: Case 105 total time is wrong (1,505 min/25h5m vs. actual ~2,945 min/49h5m from 03-01 08:25 to **03-03** 09:30). This miscalculates average (~936 min vs. actual ~1,224 min), skews "~60% longer" claim, and understates worst outlier. Unforgivable for time-based analysis.
  - **Incomplete task 3**: Promises "Recommendations" in heading but provides none—cuts off mid-explanation after 2 bullets ("How These Factors Increase Cycle Times"). No insights/proposals (e.g., training, automation) despite task requiring them. Partial fulfillment = major deduction.
  - **Minor issues compounding strictness**: Vague/unsupported claims (e.g., "inefficient process design" lacks evidence; "~60%" imprecise due to errors). Over-relies on "19h investigation" without quantifying all gaps precisely (e.g., case 105 escalation to investigate: actually ~28h across days, not just 4h).
- **Overall**: Solid framework/insights but undermined by critical calc error, wrong average, and non-delivery on recommendations. Not "nearly flawless"—strictly mid-tier.
