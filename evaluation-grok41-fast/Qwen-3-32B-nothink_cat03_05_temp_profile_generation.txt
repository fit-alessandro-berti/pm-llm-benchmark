**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**:
  - Correct structure: Valid Python dictionary with tuple keys `(earlier, later)` and values `(avg_sec, stdev_sec)`. Units in seconds explicit in notes.
  - Covers representative subset: Includes all 9 direct/adjacent pairs in the linear sequence (SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS) + ~25 indirect pairs spanning multiple steps, adding complexity as required.
  - Realistic individual estimates: Direct pairs plausible (e.g., OPRC 1 week shipping, CAPT 2 weeks manufacturing/testing, DTAS 30 days post-sale).
  - Extra value: Comments, rationale, ZETA mention enhance usability without violating instructions.
  - Forward-only pairs: No invalid reverse pairs.

- **Major Inaccuracies/Logical Flaws (severe deductions)**:
  - **Inconsistent temporal sums (core failure)**: Averages for indirect pairs must approximate sums of intermediates (as this is a linear process; avg time AC  avg AB + BC). Multiple gross violations:
    | Pair | Provided Avg (days) | Expected Sum (days) | Error |
    |------|---------------------|---------------------|-------|
    | CADT | 7 | ~22 (CAPT 14 + PTPK 1 + PKWS 0.3 + WSDT 7) | -68% |
    | PTAS | 16 | ~38 (PTPK 1 + PKWS 0.3 + WSDT 7 + DTAS 30) | -58% |
    | QIPT | 14 | ~21 (QICA 7 + CAPT 14) | -33% |
    | RCPT | 14 | ~21 (RCQI 0.3 + QICA 7 + CAPT 14) | -33% |
    | RCAS | 40 | ~60 (RCQI...+DTAS) | -33% |
    | CAAS | 30 | ~52 (CAPT...+DTAS) | -42% |
    SS-chain mostly close (±5%), but others fail catastrophically—undermines entire "temporal profile" model.
  - **Copy-paste errors in indirects**: E.g., RCPT, QIPT both exactly copy CAPT values; QIDT=RCDT=1,814,400—lazy, illogical.
  - **Std dev scaling illogical**: Long chains have disproportionately small/large stds vs. sums (should  (sum variances) or linear for dependent steps). E.g., SSAS std 1,555,200 (18d) vs. chain sum ~50d inconsistent with variability rationale.

- **Minor but Cumulative Issues (further deductions)**:
  - **Comment errors**: Multiple math mismatches (e.g., SSPT std 691,200s=192h but "±76 hours"; OPPT 720,000s=200h but "±80 hours"; SSDT "±100.8 hours"=362,880s but actual 907,200s). Erodes credibility.
  - **Minor sum discrepancies**: SSQI 705,600s vs. expected 720,000s (SSRC + RCQI); SSCA off by ~5,000s.
  - **Incomplete subset**: Misses key multi-step pairs (e.g., no PKAS, PTDT, WSAS) despite "complexity" emphasis; feels arbitrary.
  - **Unclear rationale**: Claims "estimated based on typical industry practices" but ignores additive logic; after-sales "long tail" mentioned but times inconsistent.
  - **No validation**: No mention of how ZETA applies to its own data or trace examples.

Nearly flawless requires perfect consistency, accurate math/comments, comprehensive subset. This has good form but fatal logical/accuracy flaws (inconsistent model defeats purpose). 4.2 reflects ~60% direct success, 40% indirect failure, penalized strictly per instructions.
