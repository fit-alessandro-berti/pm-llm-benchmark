**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
**Strengths (supporting the score):**
- Correctly identifies **Group B** as exhibiting bias (+1.5), with accurate description of the "Community Boost" (+10 adjustment) exclusively for "Highland Civic Darts Club" members (U001, U003) vs. no boost for U002.
- Accurately notes Group A's lack of adjustments (all 0 or N/A), neutrality, and decisions based on preliminary scores (+1.2).
- Good consideration of **LocalResident (TRUE only in B)** and **CommunityGroup** influence, highlighting that TRUE alone is insufficient without club membership (+1.0).
- Clear structure, tables summarized correctly, discusses **systematic differences** (e.g., favoritism leading to approvals for lower prelim scores like U003), and implications (+1.5).
- Concise conclusion tying to differential decisions (+1.0).

**Flaws Deducting Points (strict deductions for inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws):**
- **Major logical flaw/inaccuracy in decision mechanism (-1.5)**: Claims U001/U003 "approved **only after the adjustments**, moving them above a likely threshold (e.g., 710)." (1) U001's prelim 720 matches P001 (720 approved without boost), so adjustment **didn't change outcome**—"only after" is false. (2) Hypothesized "threshold (e.g., 710)" contradicted by U003 (705 **approved**) vs. consistent 710 rejections (P002/U002)—undermines core explanation of "how bias manifests" in decisions; no acknowledgment of inconsistency or alternative (e.g., non-threshold rules).
- **Minor inaccuracy/unclarity in bias scope (-0.4)**: Frames bias as "favoring local residents (especially...Club)" but all Group B are LocalResident=TRUE; phrasing implies LocalResident alone triggers boost, but text clarifies it's compound (TRUE + Club)—slight overgeneralization.
- **Overinterpretation without evidence (-0.3)**: "Protected status likely mitigates external factors" and "affirmative action"—speculative; logs show no boosts in A (all FALSE anyway), but no direct evidence of "mitigation" mechanism.
- **Minor omission (-0.3)**: Doesn't fully explore **systematic differences across groups** (e.g., all A are FALSE/non-club vs. B's TRUE/club variability; potential baseline local bias since B locals without club treated like A's non-locals).
- **Style/pedantic issues (-0.2)**: Bold emphasis repetitive; "cohort behavior aligns" vague; tables use "-> " notation not in logs.

**Total Calculation**: Base 10.0 - 4.7 (flaws) = 5.3, uplifted +2.0 for strong core/accuracy/completeness = **7.2**. Not "nearly flawless" due to central reasoning errors on adjustments' necessity/decision logic—prevents 9+; good but not elite under hypercritical lens.
