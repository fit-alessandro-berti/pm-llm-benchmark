**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting higher base score)**:
  - Correct format: Valid Python dictionary with tuple keys (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`) and value tuples `(average_time, standard_deviation)` in seconds. Assignment to `temporal_profile` is a minor enhancement, not a flaw.
  - Representative subset with complexity: 20 pairs, including direct (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`) and multi-step skips (e.g., `('SS', 'PT')`, `('QI', 'DT')`), reflecting the linear sequence SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDTAS. Covers early-to-late progression well.
  - Reasonable domain estimates: Times align with supply chain realities (e.g., OPRC at 1 week for lead time, DTAS at ~30 days). Std devs are plausible (often 10-20% of avg, scaling with distance).
  - Helpful comments and explanation: Translate seconds to days/hours, categorize direct/non-sequential, note cumulative logic—enhances clarity without being required.
  - All pairs logically valid: No reverse-order or impossible pairs.

- **Inaccuracies and logical flaws (major deductions; hypercritical lens)**:
  - **Inconsistent cumulative averages (core logical flaw)**: Averages should approximately sum component intervals for linearity. Multiple failures:
    | Pair | Provided Avg (s) | Expected Sum (s, approx) | Error |
    |------|------------------|---------------------------|-------|
    | ('QI', 'PK') | 72000 (~20h) | 28800+43200+14400=86400 (24h) | Forgot PTPK; ~17% under |
    | ('OP', 'PK') | 648000 (~7.5d) | 604800+14400+28800+43200+14400=705600 (~8.2d) | Forgot CAPT + PTPK; ~8% under |
    | ('QI', 'DT') | 172800 (48h) | 28800+43200+14400+7200+86400=180000 (~52h) | ~4% under, incomplete sum |
    | ('CA', 'DT') | 172800 (48h) | 43200+14400+7200+86400=163200 (~43h) | ~6% over, arbitrary inflation |
    - Some correct (e.g., ('SS', 'PT')=777600 exact sum), but inconsistency implies sloppy estimation, undermining "temporal profile from logs" model.
  - **Std dev handling unclear/inconsistent**: Should approximate (variances) for independents, but often copies max component (e.g., ('SS', 'RC') std=86400 from OPRC) or scales arbitrarily. E.g., ('PT', 'AS')=432000 (same as DTAS, ignoring PTDT variance). Minor but logically weak for multi-step.
  - **Minor numerical oddities**: ('PT', 'AS')=2595600 (~30.03d) vs DTAS 2592000 (30d exact); unexplained +3600s (1h). Hypercritical: pointless precision without basis.
  - **Incomplete coverage**: Claims "representative subset ensuring complexity," but omits obvious long-range like ('SS', 'AS'), ('RC', 'AS') has but not ('PK', 'AS') or ('CA', 'AS'). Subset ok per prompt, but uneven (heavy on mid-process skips).
  - **Unclarity**: Explanation says "cumulative estimates of the intermediate steps," but flawed sums contradict this. No mention of assumptions (e.g., independence, log-based).

- **Scoring math**: Base 9.5 for format/content/estimates. Deduct 1.0 for cumulative errors (3+ instances, direct violation of additive model). Deduct 0.5 for std dev sloppiness. Deduct 0.3 for coverage gaps/minor oddities. Deduct 0.5 for inconsistency undermining credibility. Total: **7.2** (good but flawed; not "nearly flawless").
