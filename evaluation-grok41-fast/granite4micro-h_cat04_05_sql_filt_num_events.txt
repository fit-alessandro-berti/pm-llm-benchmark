**9.2**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Correctness (strong, but not perfect)**: The query logically works perfectly. The window function correctly computes event counts per `case_id` without grouping collapse, the CASE labels rows accurately, and the outer filter excludes >6-event cases entirely while retaining all events from 6-event cases. Handles edge cases (e.g., 0-6 events, multiple cases) implicitly. DuckDB compatibility confirmed. No syntax errors or runtime issues.
  - *Minor deduction (-0.3)*: Output includes an extraneous `is_valid_case` column (due to outer `SELECT *`). The task specifies "returns only the events" and "the full set of events," implying original columns from `event_log` without additions. This alters the result set unnecessarily, though the core event data is intact. A flawless version would use `SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6)` or equivalent JOIN/CTE to avoid extras.

- **Completeness & Efficiency**: Fully addresses requirements (grouping via PARTITION BY, filtering, full event return). Window function is efficient (single pass, no self-join needed). Step-by-step breakdown, explanation, and verification steps are thorough and educational.
  - *Minor deduction (-0.2)*: Explanation claims "returning only those events belonging to valid cases," but glosses over the extra column in output—slight unclarity/misrepresentation of exact result schema.

- **Clarity & Style**: Well-structured response with headings, code block, and rationale. Readable SQL with good formatting. No ambiguities in logic or instructions.
  - *No deduction*: Pedantic notes (e.g., CASE indentation minor, 'valid'/NULL arbitrary but functional) ignored as non-impactful.

- **Strictness Applied**: 10.0 reserved for *nearly flawless* (zero nitpicks, exact schema match). Here, minor output schema impurity and phrasing imprecision prevent perfection but don't undermine utility—hence high-but-not-max score. Any logical inaccuracy would tank to <7; this is top-tier with tiny flaws.
