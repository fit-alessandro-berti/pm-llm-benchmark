**4.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Major Syntax/Compatibility Error (Fatal, -3.0 points)**: `STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp)` is **invalid in DuckDB**. DuckDB's `STRING_AGG` does not support an inline `ORDER BY` clause (unlike `LIST_AGG`). Correct approach: `ARRAY_JOIN(LIST_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp), '->') AS activity_sequence`. The query fails to parse/execute, failing task #1 entirely. This alone disqualifies it as a working DuckDB query.
- **Parameterization Flaw (Severe, -1.5 points)**: `LIMIT K` is invalid SQL; `K` is undefined (syntax error). Task implies a general "top K" query, but no parameterization (e.g., `LIMIT ?` or DuckDB variable `SET k=5; LIMIT k`). Placeholder note in explanation doesn't fix the broken code.
- **Incomplete Ordering Handling (Minor but notable, -0.5 points)**: `timestamp` ties could lead to unstable ordering in aggregates (no secondary sort like `ROW_NUMBER` or `CASE WHEN`). Assumes unique timestamps, unstated.
- **Redundant DISTINCT (Nit, -0.3 points)**: `SELECT DISTINCT oe.case_id` in `TopCaseIDs` is unnecessary; join on unique `case_id` from `OrderedEvents` yields uniques anyway.
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Logical structure is sound—CTEs correctly pipeline sequencing  variant grouping/counting  top-K filtering  event return (+4.0 base). Returns `el.*` correctly filters to top-K cases' events. Separator `'->'` consistent for grouping. Explanation clear but doesn't acknowledge errors.
- **Overall**: Logic 80% right but **non-executable** in DuckDB = significantly flawed. Only mid-score despite good intent; flawless requires runnable, precise SQL.
