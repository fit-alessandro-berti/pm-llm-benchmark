The response is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It delivers exactly 20 open-ended, thought-provoking questions directly tied to the described process (e.g., specific suppliers like Taiwan, assembly in Malaysia, transport modes, digital systems, compliance, recalls, sustainability). All probe insights, issues, improvements, and implications without inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. No SQL queries or extraneous content; the minimal header precisely frames the list as instructed. No repetition undermines uniqueness; even overlapping themes (e.g., warranties in Q13/Q19) are distinctly angled. Perfect adherence.
