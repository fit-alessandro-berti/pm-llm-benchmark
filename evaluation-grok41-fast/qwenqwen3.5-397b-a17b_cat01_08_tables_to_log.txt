**9.4**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
The final output (table + decisions + assumptions) is **nearly flawless** but incurs minor deductions for the following strict issues, each warranting a ~0.1-0.3 point penalty under "utmost strictness":

- **Invented Reference IDs (significant inaccuracy, -0.4)**: For Orders (e.g., "ORD-1001") and Order Lines (e.g., "LINE-1001-001"), IDs are fabricated/not present in source tables. Real data uses raw `order_id` or no unique line ID. This introduces non-data elements without explicit documentation as "derived" in assumptions. Deliveries/Invoices/Payments use correct IDs, but inconsistency flaws traceability.
  
- **Activity Name Variations (minor logical mismatch, -0.1)**: Prompt specifies "Order Created", "Items Picked", "Order Dispatched", "Order Arrived", "Invoice Issued", "Payment Received". Output uses "Create Order", "Pick Item" (singular vs. suggested plural), "Dispatch Shipment"/"Arrive Shipment" (adapted for splits but deviates from "Order" phrasing). Logical inferences allowed, but not exact.

- **Redundant/Truncated Details (minor unclarities, -0.1)**: Event Details repeat info already in Resource (e.g., "Carrier: CR-01; Note: ...", "Sales Person: SP-001"). DLV-5005 note truncated ("Fragile items" vs. full "Fragile items, handle with care"). No qty/amount in non-pick/invoice events where irrelevant, but consistency lacking.

**Strengths (why not lower)**:
- **Completeness (flawless)**: All events included (e.g., multi-picks, multi-deliveries/invoices/payments for 1002; incomplete 1004 correctly handled without fabrication).
- **Chronology (flawless)**: Perfect per-case sorting/timestamps (e.g., 1002: picks  dispatches  arrivals  invoices  payments).
- **Integration/Enrichment (flawless)**: Correct joins (Payments via InvoiceOrder); Resources perfectly mapped (e.g., "Alice Brown (Sales Person)"); case attributes (Customer Type, Priority) denormalized appropriately.
- **Format/Structure (flawless)**: Valid Markdown table; minimum columns + useful extras (no bloat); decisions/assumptions clearly document handling (e.g., payments resource, incompletes, granularity).
- **No Major Flaws**: No missing events/data loss; logical granularity (per-item picks matches "event(s)"); no chronological errors; inferences supported by data.

Score reflects **hypercritical** stance: 10.0 reserved for zero deviations (exact prompt phrasing, no inventions). This is exemplary for process mining (sortable, analyzable, granular).
