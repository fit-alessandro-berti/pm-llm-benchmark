**4.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Anomaly Identification (9/10):** Accurately lists the 4 key anomalies from the model (R-P low STDEV, P-N long/high variability, A-C quick closure, E-N too rapid/low STDEV). Descriptions are precise and independent. Minor deduction for not quantifying all model values consistently (e.g., E-N STDEV as "minimal" vs. exact 60s).
- **Hypotheses Generation (8/10):** Relevant and tied to prompt examples (automation, backlogs, skips, resource issues). Logical and business-plausible. Slight deduction for vagueness in some (e.g., "workflow logic flaw" lacks specificity) and not covering all model pairs exhaustively.
- **SQL Verification Proposals (2/10):** Fundamentally flawed despite good intent/structure:
  | Issue | Impact | Examples |
  |-------|--------|----------|
  | **Schema Violations (Fatal)** | Queries won't execute/join incorrectly. No `adjuster_id` or `region` in `claims`; link must use `claim_events.resource` (VARCHAR) to `adjusters.name`/`adjuster_id`. | R-P/P-N joins: `c.claim_id = a.adjuster_id` (wrong columns); P-N: `a.region = c.region` (claims lacks `region`). A-C/E-N select unqualified `region` (no source). Additional query assumes nonexistent `c.adjuster_id`. |
  | **Factual Errors** | Wrong model values undermine credibility. | P-N: Model=604800s (7d), answer=6,720,000s (~78d, off by ~11x); query uses 6720000*2. |
  | **Logical/Threshold Flaws** | Arbitrary heuristics (2x avg, <avg) ignore STDEV/ZETA; no Z-score or range calc. No sequence checks (e.g., missing E/P between A-C). | All queries; e.g., A-C filters <7200s but purpose notes "check intermediate steps" (query doesn't). |
  | **Incompleteness** | Weak correlation (broken joins prevent adjuster/region analysis); no `customer_id`/`claim_type` use despite prompt. | Misses prompt: "correlate with... claim types... customer or region segments." |
- **Overall Structure/Presentation (9/10):** Clean, independent, task-aligned sections/purposes. No instruction refs.
- **Composite:** Strong conceptual work dragged by critical technical failures in core SQL task (50%+ of prompt). Not "nearly flawless"—major inaccuracies/logical flaws warrant sharp penalty per criteria.
