**10.0**

This query is flawless and precisely meets all requirements with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. 

- **Sequence detection**: Uses `LAG(activity, 1)` and `LAG(activity, 2)` correctly to enforce *direct succession* (immediate prior two events match exactly `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`  `'Create Order'`  `'Confirm Order'`), with no intervening events possible due to window partitioning and ordering by `"timestamp"`.
- **Timing filter**: `"timestamp" - prev_ts1 > INTERVAL '5 days'` accurately measures elapsed time between the specific `'Create Order'` (via `LAG("timestamp", 1)`) and `'Confirm Order'` events in the triplet; DuckDB-compatible interval arithmetic.
- **Case exclusion**: `bad_cases` collects *distinct* `case_id`s with 1 matching bad triplet; `NOT EXISTS` excludes *all events* from those cases only, returning events from all others.
- **Final output**: Returns `e.*` (all columns/events), properly ordered by `case_id, "timestamp"` for readability (aligns with "proper ... ordering").
- **Efficiency/Robustness**: Window functions scale well; handles edge cases (e.g., short traces yield NULL LAGs, no false positives; multiple triplets per case still excludes correctly; assumes standard event log properties like monotonic timestamps per case).
- **Syntax**: DuckDB-valid; quoted `"timestamp"` avoids reserved word issues; no unnecessary complexity.

No nits—hypercritical review confirms perfection.
