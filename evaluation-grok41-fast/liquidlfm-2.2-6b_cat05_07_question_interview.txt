**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Strengths (supporting the score)**:
  - Questions are predominantly open-ended (e.g., "How do you...", "What kind..."), targeted at conceptual deepening (criteria, exceptions, challenges), and avoid SQL/implementation details entirely.
  - Good coverage of decision criteria (e.g., Q2 on weighing factors, Q6 on negotiations), exceptions (Q9 excellently probes examples/patterns), missing details/common issues (Q1, Q4, Q6), and roles/stakeholders (Q10 partially).
  - Logical structure with thematic grouping aids clarity; total ~15 sub-questions provide comprehensive probing without redundancy.
  - Closing sentence aligns with goal of "holistic insights."

- **Major Flaws (significant deductions)**:
  - **Critical omission: Timing and sequencing**. Prompt explicitly requires questions to "verify timing and sequencing" (e.g., durations, dependencies like photographer before/after inspector, gaps between activation and leasing). Zero questions address this (e.g., no "What is the typical timeline from documentation to activation?" or "Does marketing begin before/after inspection clearance?"). This is a core gap in ~20% of specified goals, warranting -1.5.
  - **Roles and responsibilities under-covered**. Probes are superficial/vague (e.g., Q10's "stakeholders typically play" is broad; no specifics on coordinator vs. manager handoffs, compliance officer triggers, or IT integration points). Partial credit only (-0.8).

- **Minor but Penalized Issues (strict per instructions)**:
  - **Inaccuracies/unclarities**:
    - Q4: "renters’ responsibilities" – illogical/misaligned; process is pre-tenant (onboarding before marketing/activation). Should reference landlord/tenant policy discussions (-0.3).
    - Q7 (second): "priority access to properties?" – unclear/undefined term; doesn't tie to process (landlords aren't given "priority access") (-0.2).
    - Q8 (second): Assumes "properties that failed" proceed to audits; description states fixes occur pre-activation (-0.2).
  - **Grammar/logical slips**:
    - Q8 (first): "these experience matter"  "these experiences matter?" (-0.1).
    - Q10 (second): "experience learned"  "experiences learned" (-0.1).
    - Some leading/assumptive phrasing (e.g., Q7 "despite landlord assurances?" assumes unmentioned behavior; Q1 "historically led" implies data not specified) (-0.2 total).
  - **Scope creep**: Q5 on "post-marketing launch" adjustments and Q10 on process changes are tangential/meta, not directly deepening *this* process's description (-0.2).

- **Scoring Math**: Base 9.0 (strong conceptual fit) minus 1.5 (timing gap) minus 0.8 (roles gap) minus 1.0 (inaccuracies/grammar/unclarities) = 7.2. Not "nearly flawless" due to omissions and errors; solid but flawed under hypercriticism.
