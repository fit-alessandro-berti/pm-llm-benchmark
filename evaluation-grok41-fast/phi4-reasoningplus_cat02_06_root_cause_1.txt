**9.8**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Task 1 (Identification of long cases)**: Perfect. Correctly identifies 102, 104, 105 as outliers with accurate approximate durations (all match precise calculations: 102=25h10m, 104=24h10m, 105=49h5m). Contrasts explicitly with quick cases 101/103. No errors.
- **Task 2 (Root causes)**: Excellent. Pinpoints escalations (102/105 with exact gaps: 2.5h and 28h correct), waiting periods (104's 3.5h gap exact), and ties to process inefficiencies. Covers prompt-suggested factors precisely without omission or invention. Notes 105's dual investigations accurately.
- **Task 3 (Explanation & Recommendations)**: Strong. Clearly explains escalation/coordination delays and resource gaps as cycle-time extenders, with logical causation. Recommendations are targeted, actionable (e.g., handover protocols, alerts, criteria refinement), and insightful. Summary reinforces without redundancy.
- **Overall Structure/Clarity/Accuracy**: Flawless matching of prompt structure (1/2/3). Concise, precise timestamps/gaps, no logical flaws, no unclarities. Professional tone.
- **Minor Deductions (-0.2 total)**: Durations use "roughly/about/nearly" instead of exact hh:mm (e.g., "25 hours" vs. "25h10m"), which is pedantic but technically less precise under hypercriticism. No other issues—self-contained, no contradictions, fully addresses bottlenecks. Nearly flawless; 10.0 reserved for zero nitpicks.
