**7.0**

The query demonstrates solid logical structure and intent: it correctly uses a CTE to compute event counts per `case_id`, filters via `HAVING` for cases with 6 events, and then retrieves all events (`e.*`) for qualifying cases using an `IN` subquery. This matches the requirements precisely in concept, including proper grouping, filtering "more than six" cases (>6 events excluded), and returning the full event set for valid cases.

However, under utmost strictness, it has a critical syntactic inaccuracy fatal to execution in DuckDB (PostgreSQL-compatible): the `HAVING event_count <= 6` references the `event_count` alias defined in the same `SELECT` list. SQL standards and DuckDB evaluate `HAVING` before `SELECT` aliases are applied, causing an error like "column 'event_count' does not exist." 

To fix: `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` (repeat the aggregate) or restructure as a subquery. This is a common pitfall but disqualifies flawlessness—logical perfection undermined by non-executable code. No other issues (e.g., efficiency, readability, DuckDB compatibility beyond this, or over/under-filtering), but this alone prevents a 9+ score per "hypercritical" criteria. A correct version would be 10.0.
