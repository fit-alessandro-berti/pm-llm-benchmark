**3.0**

### Reasoning for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation of Final Output Only):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**:
  - Correct structure: Markdown table with required columns (Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource/Actor, Other Attributes).
  - Most events correctly derived and included where data exists (e.g., all Order Created, all per-item picks as separate events with logical "Item Picked", all per-delivery Dispatched/Arrived, per-invoice Issued, per-payment Received).
  - Timestamps accurately mapped from source tables.
  - Resources correctly enriched via Resources table (e.g., names/roles for sales, pickers, carriers, billing; appropriate "(No resource)" for payments).
  - Other Attributes relevant and accurately pulled (e.g., item_id/quantity, delivery_note, invoice_amount, payment_method/reference, customer details for creates).
  - Handles multiples correctly (e.g., 2 picks for 1001, 2 deliveries for 1002, 2 invoices/payments for 1002).
  - All order_ids (1001-1005) represented.

- **Critical Flaws (severe deductions)**:
  - **Factual inaccuracies in data linking (major)**: Order 1004 has **no** entries in Delivery, Invoice, or Payments tables, so it should **only** have "Order Created" + "Item Picked" (2 events total). The table fabricates 4 entirely wrong events for it ("Order Dispatched/Arrived" with DLV-5005, "Invoice Issued" INV-1005, "Payment Received" PAY-2005), incorrectly assigning data belonging to order 1005. This violates "Combine Data: Link each event using the keys provided" and "Ensure that every event for every `order_id` is included" (includes non-existent events, corrupts 1005's uniqueness).
  - **Chronological incorrectness (major)**: Events not sorted chronologically within cases, breaking "Maintain chronological correctness" and "each event row is placed in sequence and can be traced...". For 1002: "Order Dispatched" DLV-5003 (2024-01-05T07:00:00Z) appears **after** "Order Arrived" DLV-5002 (2024-01-07T16:10:00Z), despite Jan-05 preceding Jan-07. Correct sequence should interleave dispatches before arrivals.
  - **No documentation of assumptions/missing data**: Prompt requires "If data is missing or ambiguous, document any assumptions made." Order 1004's missing downstream data is unacknowledged (instead fabricated); no notes on e.g., payments lacking resources or "Item Picked" vs. prompt's "Items Picked".
  - **Minor but penalized issues**: Activity name "Item Picked" (per-item) is logical but deviates from prompt's exact "Items Picked" example without justification. Table not globally sorted (e.g., by case then timestamp), hindering process mining usability. Overly verbose Other Attributes for "Order Created" includes redundant sales_person_id (already in Resource).

These are not minor—core requirements for accurate integration, linking, sequencing, and completeness are violated, rendering the log unusable for process mining (wrong traces for 1002/1004/1005). Nearly flawless would require zero errors; this has multiple showstoppers. 3.0 reflects ~70% correctness offset by fatal flaws.
