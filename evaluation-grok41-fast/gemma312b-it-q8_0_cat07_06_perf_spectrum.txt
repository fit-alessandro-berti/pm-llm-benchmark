**7.2**

### Breakdown:
- **Accuracy (3.5/4):** Mostly correct on structure (layers, grey dense lines for "Send Fine" ~2000-2009, sloping lines flowing right/down to credit collection). Captures density/flow well. Minor issues: labels slightly off ("Introduce" vs. "Insert Fine Notification"; "Send for Credit Action" vs. "Send Credit Collection"); volume trend contradictory ("thinning" but "increased...toward the bottom"—visually decreases).
- **Completeness (2.0/3):** Covers type, layers, timeframe (approx. right, though x-axis ~2008+), labels. Misses nuances like exact pink/red hue, full event flow logic (fines  notifications  collections), or why it's a flow/timeline (not pure Gantt).
- **Clarity & Structure (1.7/3):** Well-organized (sections/layers). Some awkward phrasing/typos ("horizontally axis", "with respect for events"). Readable but not polished.

Solid effort—describes the essence without alt-text access—but errors in details/trends pull it down from 8+.
