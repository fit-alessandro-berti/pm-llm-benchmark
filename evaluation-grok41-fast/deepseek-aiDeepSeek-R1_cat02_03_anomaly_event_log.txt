**10.0**

The provided answer is exemplary: it precisely identifies all anomalies (Cases 1002, 1003, 1004) with exact sequences, provides accurate explanations grounded in standard P2P controls (e.g., requisition approval before PO, three-way match before payment, PO before goods receipt), and links them logically to business risks without inaccuracies, omissions, or ambiguities. Structure is clear, professional, and comprehensive, correctly implying Case 1001's normality by exclusion. No logical flaws, unclarities, or minor issues present.
