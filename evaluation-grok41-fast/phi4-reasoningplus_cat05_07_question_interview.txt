The provided answer is a numbered list of 15 targeted, open-ended questions that precisely align with the prompt's goals. Each question directly addresses key aspects of the process—documentation review (Q1-2), manager assignment criteria (Q3), introductory steps and sequencing (Q4-5), inspection/repairs and exceptions (Q6,12,14), marketing/pricing decisions (Q7,9,11), tenant screening/negotiation (Q8-9), quality checks/roles (Q10-11), communication/overall flow (Q13), and process measurement (Q15)—uncovering missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, and exception handling. All are phrased conversationally for an interviewee (e.g., "Could you describe...", "How do you ensure..."), remain strictly conceptual without any SQL queries, code, or low-level implementation specifics (high-level mentions like "automated checks" or "tools" are process-oriented validations, not technical details), and contain no inaccuracies, unclarities, repetitions, or logical flaws. Coverage is comprehensive yet concise, logically probing the description's stages and gaps without redundancy or overreach.
