**4.0**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown
This grade reflects partial credit for structure and identifying *one* major normative violation (Case 2's sequence issue), but severe deductions for incompleteness, factual inaccuracies, logical flaws, unclarities, and failure to fully address the task. Even minor issues were penalized heavily per instructions; here, issues are major.

#### 1. **Task 1: Normative Violations (Partial Credit, ~5/10)**
   - **Strength:** Correctly identifies Case 2's Risk Assessment before Credit Check as a violation, with accurate explanation tied to constraints.
   - **Flaws (Severe Deductions):**
     - **Incomplete:** Misses Case 2's *second explicit normative violation* ("Finalize Documentation after rejection" – directly listed under "What is Not Allowed"). This is not minor; it's a core "contradictory action" prohibition, making the analysis of Case 2 only ~50% complete.
     - No explicit confirmation that Case 1 complies fully (sequence perfect, approved path correct). Task requires "identify which cases" – implying all must be assessed/addressed.
     - Case 3 implicitly ok (correct), but silence on Case 1 leaves gap.
     - Summary omits full Case 2 details, understating severity.

#### 2. **Task 2: Desiderata Failures (Minimal Credit, ~2/10)**
   - **Strength:** Recognizes Case 3 has timing issues; clarifies "not a hard rule" / "suboptimal" somewhat adequately.
   - **Flaws (Catastrophic Deductions):**
     - **Factual Errors:** 
       - Claims inform applicant is "approximately 14 days after loan decision" – **wrong**. Decision: 2024-01-14 12:00; Inform: 2024-01-16 15:00 (~2.5 days). This is a gross miscalculation, undermining credibility.
       - Claims finalize documentation "approximately a week after loan approval" – **wrong**. ~2 days 21 hours. Fabricates severity.
     - **Incomplete:** 
       - Ignores Credit Check in Case 3 (~49 hours after app received, >24h desideratum explicitly stated).
       - No mention of "Follow-up Call" desideratum *at all* (missing in Cases 1 *and* 3; encouraged "before closing").
       - Case 1: Perfect timings (credit ~30min, inform ~2h), but misses follow-up – should note as desideratum failure for completeness.
     - **Logical Flaw:** Invents undocumented desiderata ("finalizing documentation immediately... within hours" – original only specifies credit/inform timings + follow-up; no "prompt finalize").
     - Labels them "Violation:" repeatedly, despite task's "not severe, suboptimal" emphasis – muddies distinction.

#### 3. **Task 3: Interpretations/Justifications (Weak, ~3/10)**
   - **Strength:** Provides some generic suggestions (e.g., delays/system issues).
   - **Flaws:**
     - Superficial/vague ("unexpected delays," "staffing shortages") – not "in line with constraints" (e.g., doesn't justify how Case 2's *post-reject finalize* could align; impossible per rules).
     - No justifications for Case 1 (perfect compliance) or full Case 3 sequence.
     - Doesn't tie to "when possible" – e.g., no interpretation for missing follow-up (e.g., "not always feasible").

#### Overall Structural/Style Issues (Further Deductions)
- **Incomplete Coverage:** Case 1 never mentioned – task implies evaluate *all* cases.
- **Unclear/Overly Verbose:** Part 2 summary adds unsubstantiated "non-adherence to promptness in step closure"; conclusion repeats without synthesis.
- **Logical Inconsistency:** Part 1 summary says Case 2 "skipping... and out of sequence" (ok), but ignores finalize; treats desiderata as near-equivalent to violations.
- **No Flawlessness:** Multiple objective errors (timings), omissions (violations, desiderata), prevent >5.0. Structure mimics task but content ~50% accurate/effective.

A 10.0 requires *nearly flawless* (e.g., full case-by-case, precise facts, complete desiderata list). This is functional but riddled with gaps/errors – solidly mid-low.
