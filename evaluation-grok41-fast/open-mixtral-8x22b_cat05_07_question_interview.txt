**8.2**

### Evaluation:
This is a strong, comprehensive list of 15 targeted, open-ended questions that excellently cover decision criteria (e.g., Q2, Q6-Q10), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q1, Q9-Q10, Q15), missing details (e.g., Q1, Q6, Q12), and exceptions handling (e.g., Q3-Q5, Q11, Q14). All questions are precisely tied to the process description, phrased neutrally without requesting SQL or implementation details, and they deepen conceptual understanding effectively. No inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclear phrasing—each is crisp and interviewee-friendly.

**Major deduction for incompleteness on "verify timing and sequencing"**: The prompt explicitly lists this as a core aim, yet zero questions address it. No probes on timelines (e.g., "How long does each phase typically take?" or "What is the end-to-end duration?"), sequencing verification (e.g., "Are steps strictly linear, or do any occur in parallel?" or "What triggers movement from documentation to manager assignment?"), dependencies, or flow exceptions (e.g., "Can marketing start before inspection?"). The process description emphasizes sequencing ("begins... Next... Following... After... Finally..."), decision points, and lifecycle flow, making this omission a critical gap—nearly 20% of the stated goals ignored. This prevents "nearly flawless" status.

**Minor deductions (-0.3 total)**:
- Q13 (KPIs) and Q15 (training) are tangential/redundant; not directly derived from the description (no mention of metrics/training), diluting focus slightly.
- Q7/Q9 emphasize "fairness/biases/regulations" (fair, but process doesn't highlight this; feels proactively added rather than clarification-driven).
- Overkill length (15 questions) risks interviewee fatigue, though not prohibited.

Overall, 90%+ alignment, but strict criteria demand deduction for the explicit timing/sequencing void and minor bloat—elevating to 9+ requires exhaustive coverage of *all* prompt aims without extras.
