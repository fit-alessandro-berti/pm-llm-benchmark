**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It precisely identifies Group B's log as exhibiting bias, correctly attributes the mechanism to the conditional +10 "Community Boost" triggered by `LocalResident=TRUE` combined with specific `CommunityGroup` membership (absent in Group A), and demonstrates manifestation through direct case comparisons (e.g., U003's 695 prelim boosted to 705 approved vs. P002's unboosted 710 rejected). Threshold inference from Group A (720 approved) is accurate and logically supports the disparity without contradiction, as the boost creates an effective lower bar for qualifying Group B cases (noting 705 < 710 starkly underscores favoritism without claiming an exact universal threshold). All required elements (attributes' influence, ScoreAdjustment role, systematic decision differences disadvantaging protected Group A) are covered comprehensively, structured clearly, and free of inaccuracies, unclarities, overstatements, or logical gaps. No minor issues detract.
