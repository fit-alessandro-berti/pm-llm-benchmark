**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Base Score)**:
  - Excellent structure: Clear sections, tables, summaries, and recommendations perfectly align with the task's 3 parts. Distinguishes normative (strict) vs. desiderata (soft) flawlessly in concept.
  - Task 1 (Normative): Correctly identifies Case 1 & 3 as compliant; accurately flags Case 2's Risk Assessment before Credit Check and Finalize Documentation after rejection, with precise timestamps, rule citations, and impacts.
  - Task 2 (Desiderata): Spot-on for all cases—precise timing calculations (e.g., ~49h & ~51h for Case 3), clarifies "suboptimal but not critical," correctly downplays Follow-up Call as optional.
  - Task 3 (Interpretations): Provides plausible, constraint-aligned justifications (e.g., data entry error, weekend lags) without excusing violations—directly fulfills "in line with constraints."
  - Overall: Comprehensive, professional, actionable recommendations; no unclarities or logical flaws in covered content; ignores nothing else.

- **Fatal Flaws (Strict Deductions, Preventing >8.0)**:
  - **Major Inaccuracy in Task 1 (Case 2 Normative Violations)**: Completely misses the **skipping of mandatory "Inform Applicant"** after Loan Decision (required by explicit rules: "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed"; "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision"; no skipping allowed). Log has **zero record** post-Decision (09:30) before Finalize/Close—clear normative violation (third one, alongside the two correctly identified). Answer speculates "Not recorded—likely occurred" (in desiderata section), misclassifying it as soft/optional and assuming unlogged activity against the provided log. Conclusions explicitly state "two critical ways" and table lists only two—**incomplete & logically flawed analysis** of violations. Hypercritical penalty: -2.0 (core task incompletion).
  - **Minor Derivation Flaw**: Case 2 desiderata wrongly frames missing Inform as "irrelevant due to normative violations" (it's *another* normative issue) and ties Credit Check timing oddly to "40 minutes after Risk" (accurate but underscores sequence primacy without addressing skip). Penalty: -0.3.
  - **No Other Issues**: No reversals, contradictions, or penalties from "flow of thought" (none present). Interpretations don't over-justify violations.

- **Scoring Logic**: Starts at 10.0 for structure/content excellence; deducts heavily for the unambiguous miss of a mandatory step (not "nearly flawless"—~33% shortfall in Case 2 violations). 7.2 reflects "very good but critically incomplete" under utmost strictness.
