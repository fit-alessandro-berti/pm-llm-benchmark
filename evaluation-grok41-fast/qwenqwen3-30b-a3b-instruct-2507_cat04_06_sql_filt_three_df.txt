**2.0**

### Critical Evaluation:
- **Major logical flaw (direct succession not enforced; -5.0)**: The query fails the core requirement of "direct succession with no other event from the same case in between them." The self-joins only enforce loose temporal order (`timestamp > previous`), allowing intervening events between `e1`/`e2` or `e2`/`e3`. Counterexample: Events [Approve (t1), Other (t1.5), Create (t2), Confirm (t8)] would incorrectly match (`t2 > t1`, `t8 > t2`, `t8 - t2 > 5 days`), excluding the entire case despite non-consecutive sequence. Correct approach requires consecutiveness (e.g., `ROW_NUMBER()` per case ordered by `timestamp`, checking activities at `rn`, `rn+1`, `rn+2`).
- **Misleading explanation (-1.0)**: Claims "**direct succession** via `JOIN` with timestamp constraints," which is factually wrong—inaccurate representation of the query's capabilities.
- **Incomplete edge case handling (-1.0)**: Assumes no timestamp ties/duplicates (noted but unaddressed in query); real logs may have them, breaking order assumptions without tiebreakers (e.g., event ID).
- **Minor positives (partial credit)**: Correctly excludes entire cases (+0.5), applies time filter precisely between `Create Order`/`Confirm Order` (+0.5), uses DuckDB `INTERVAL` correctly, `DISTINCT` avoids dupes, orders output sensibly (though unrequired).
- **Irrelevant extras (-0.5)**: Offers unrequested additions (e.g., metadata); notes are cautious but don't fix flaws.

**Total: 2.0**. Fundamentally incorrect for the prompt's explicit "direct succession" criterion; not "nearly flawless."
