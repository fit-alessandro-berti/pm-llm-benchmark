**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is strong in structure, clarity, use of tables, and overall coverage—exemplary formatting and logical flow earn baseline credit. It correctly identifies **no normative violations in Cases 1 and 3** (flawless here), accurately details Case 2's two highlighted normative violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection), and provides solid desiderata analysis for Case 3 with precise time calculations (~49h, ~51h gaps). Interpretations are plausible and context-aware (e.g., weekend delays for Case 3), and the summary table is concise/effective. These merits prevent a sub-7 score.

However, **strict deductions for multiple inaccuracies, omissions, and flaws** (each significantly lowers score per instructions):
- **Major omission (Case 2 normative, -1.5):** Completely misses skipping **Inform Applicant**—a *mandatory* step ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed"; sequence explicitly requires it after Decision, before branch/Close). Log has no entry (unlike Cases 1/3); this is a clear "skipping activities" violation, comparable in severity to listed ones. Case 2 has **at least three** normative violations, not two—incomplete analysis undermines Task 1.
- **Major fabrication/inaccuracy (Case 2 desiderata, -1.0):** Invents "Applicant was informed 30 minutes after the loan decision" (no log entry exists; 09:30 Decision  10:00 Finalize  Inform). This is a factual error, not interpretation—log-driven task makes it egregious.
- **Minor inaccuracy (Case 2 desiderata timing, -0.3):** "Credit Check was performed 20 minutes after application"—false; 08:00 App  09:00 Credit = **60 minutes** (20 min was to Risk Assessment). Sloppy reading of timestamps.
- **Minor inconsistency (Case 1 desiderata, -0.2):** Claims "No Desiderata Violations" despite acknowledging "Follow-up Call is not explicitly recorded." Desiderata explicitly encourages Follow-up "before closing the case" (none logged in *any* case); Case 1 fails it like others—downplays as non-issue.
- **Logical unclarities (minor, -0.0 cumulative):** Summary table lists only two Case 2 normative violations (incomplete); Case 2 desiderata calls analysis "moot" but includes fabricated positives; no interpretation for missed Inform violation.

**Net: 10 - 3.0 = 7.0.** Nearly flawless except Case 2 errors (core to one case); flawless would require spotting *all* log deviations (e.g., Inform skip), zero inventions/misreads. Strong but not elite—requires correction/retraining metaphorically applies here.
