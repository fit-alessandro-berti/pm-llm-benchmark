The provided answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It correctly identifies and implements the precise requirements: grouping by `case_id`, filtering via `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to retain only qualifying cases, and returning the full event rows (`e.*`) for those cases. Both the primary CTE-based query and the alternative EXISTS subquery are logically sound, semantically correct for DuckDB, efficient for typical event log sizes, and produce identical results matching the spec ("full set of events for the remaining cases"). 

Explanations are clear, accurate, and structured without redundancy or error—Step 1 is purely illustrative, not misrepresented as final code. No inaccuracies (e.g., correct use of JOIN and EXISTS correlation), unclarities (e.g., precise terminology like "six or fewer"), or flaws (e.g., handles all columns implicitly via `*`; no unnecessary assumptions about data or ordering). DuckDB compatibility is affirmed. Extra approaches add value without detracting. No deductions warranted, even for minor stylistic preferences.
