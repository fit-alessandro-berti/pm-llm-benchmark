7.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (why not lower):**
- Coherent narrative flow accurately reconstructs a plausible loan process (ABCED[another]EFGH), correctly citing/mapping many key constraints: init(A), exactly_one(B), response(AB), succession(BC), altsuccession/chainsuccession(CED), responded_existence(DE), precedence(EF), altresponse(GH), coexistence(C,F), absence(Z).
- Strong real-life mapping of activities (e.g., B as credit screen, C as docs, E as QA, etc.) and explanation of compliance/quality (checkpoints, risk reduction), sequence (logical gating), interplay (exactly-once B, QA mandates, sequencing).
- Excellent speculation on business goals (risk minimization, efficiency, auditability) and regulations (due diligence, fair lending), tying to transparency/trust.
- Well-structured, readable, insightful prose without fluff.

**Fatal Flaws (inaccuracies, logical flaws, unclarities든ach docking ~0.5-1.0):**
- **Incompleteness on "each" constraints/activities (major deduction: -1.5):** Question demands analysis of *each* constraint category and activity. Ignores/discusses ~40% implicitly at best: no mention of chainresponse(DG), chainprecedence(FB), altprecedence(HG), nonchainsuccession(FH), nonsuccession(HB), existence(A,C explicitly), altprecedence details. Z mentioned once briefly but not shaped into scenario. Negative constraints (non*, nonchain*) barely touched despite preventing invalid paths.
- **Explicit inaccuracy on constraints (-1.0):** Calls prevention of F before A an "absence constraint"등rong; absence *only* Z. No absence/F-A link exists. Noncoexistence(G,A) misinterpreted as "parallel or before" only; standard DECLARE noncoexistence forbids *any* co-occurrence in trace (both ever), illogical for process (blocks valid G *after* A)드nswer glosses without noting contradiction.
- **Logical flaws/inferred unsubstantiated claims (-0.8):** Asserts F "must happen before G" as "gating"듩o direct precedence/response/succession(FG); inferred loosely from upstream chains, but fabricates strictness. Implies F cannot precede A듯nsupported. "Nested succession of reviews" for dual E ok (model supports via positioning), but calls it "succession" loosely (responded_existence  succession). Ignores model contradictions (e.g., chainprecedence FB impossible in flow AB...F).
- **Unclarities/minor gaps (-0.5):** Doesn't explicitly quote/model entries (e.g., no "altsuccession: CE"). Speculation good but vague on *specific* regs (e.g., ties to "fair lending" but not FCRA/UDAP for credit checks). No discussion of support/confidence=1.0 implying ironclad rules.
- **Not "nearly flawless"**: ~20% inaccuracy/incompleteness + flaws prevent 9+; strong but patchwork coverage, assumes reader fills gaps.

**Score Calculation**: Base 10  -1.5 (incomp)  -1.0 (inacc)  -0.8 (logic)  -0.5 (unclear) = 6.2; uplift +1.0 for depth/flow/speculation = 7.2. Strict ceiling due to "each" mandate unmet.
