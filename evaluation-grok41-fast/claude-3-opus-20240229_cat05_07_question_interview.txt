**10.0**

### Evaluation Summary
This response is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It fully adheres to the prompt by delivering a precise, numbered **list of 15 targeted, open-ended questions** that systematically probe **missing details** (e.g., Q1, Q3, Q6), **decision criteria** (e.g., Q4, Q9), **roles/responsibilities** (e.g., Q3, Q4, Q8), **timing/sequencing** (e.g., Q2, Q7), and **exceptions handling** (e.g., Q13, Q11). Every question directly references or logically extends elements from the provided process description without introducing unrelated topics, SQL, or implementation details. All are conceptually focused, phrased conversationally yet professionally as interviewer follow-ups, and encourage elaboration.

- **Strengths (no deductions)**:
  - Comprehensive coverage: Addresses initial contact (Q1-2), data entry (Q3), manager assignment (Q4-5), inspection/repairs (Q6-7), marketing (Q8), tenant selection (Q9-10), compliance/activation (Q11), communication (Q12, Q14), exceptions (Q13), and process pain points (Q15)—mirroring the description's structure and lifecycle hints.
  - Open-ended and probing: All start with interrogatives (What, How, When, Under what) to elicit details without yes/no traps or leading assumptions.
  - No logical flaws: Questions avoid hypotheticals, speculation, or off-prompt drifts (e.g., Q14/Q15 stay tied to onboarding transitions mentioned in the description).
  - Framing: Intro/closing enhance realism as an "interviewee" dialogue without extraneous content.
  - Clarity/conciseness: Numbered, readable, no redundancies or ambiguities.

- **Hypercritical checks (all passed)**:
  - No inaccuracies: Every Q aligns verbatim with description cues (e.g., Q5 on "special conditions"; Q7 on "issues" resolution).
  - No unclarities: Precise wording (e.g., Q2 specifies "typical turnaround" and escalation without assuming outcomes).
  - Minor nitpicks absent: "A few" vs. 15 is colloquial (not literal), Q6/Q14 touch post-onboarding minimally but clarify "lifecycle" references in description; no quantifiables beyond conceptual (Q13's % is interviewee-estimated, not prescriptive).
  - Strict rubric: 100% prompt fidelity, zero violations—earns maximum score.
