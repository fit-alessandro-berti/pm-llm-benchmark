The answer is nearly flawless under hypercritical scrutiny. It correctly identifies violations precisely in Cases 2, 3, and 5 (with exact textual quotes and constraint mappings), deems Cases 1 and 4 compliant without error, and structures explanations logically without inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. The minor parenthetical note in Case 3 accurately flags an ambiguity without misclassifying it as a primary violation, aligning perfectly with the description's emphasis on explicit constraints. No over- or under-interpretation; all conclusions are robustly supported.
