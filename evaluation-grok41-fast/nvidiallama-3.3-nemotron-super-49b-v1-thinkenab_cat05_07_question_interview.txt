**9.8**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Comprehensiveness & Coverage (Near-Flawless, 10/10)**: Exhaustively maps the entire process from intake to post-onboarding audits. Directly targets all prompt-specified areas (missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing/sequencing, exceptions) with balanced distribution. Uncovers gaps (e.g., prioritization, costs, multi-unit deviations) and probes conceptual depth (e.g., approval hierarchies, common delays, edge cases like tenant backouts or repair resistance). Thematic organization enhances clarity without redundancy.
  
- **Open-Endedness & Targeting (Near-Flawless, 10/10)**: All questions are genuinely exploratory ("walk through," "describe," "how often," "what metrics," "outline a typical"). No yes/no traps, despite minor option-listing examples (e.g., "regional office, property manager"), which serve as non-restrictive prompts. Perfectly tied to description's specifics (e.g., "custom lease clause," "special requirement property," "fair housing regulations").

- **Conceptual Focus (Near-Flawless, 10/10)**: Stays strictly high-level—no SQL, code, tools implementation, or technical specs. Automation/repetition questions (e.g., "partially automated workflows") probe *conceptual* process flow/efficiency, not mechanics, aligning with "deepen conceptual understanding."

- **Accuracy & Logical Flawlessness (10/10)**: Zero inaccuracies/misreads of description (e.g., correctly infers inspector-landlord dynamics, marketing dependencies). Logical progression mirrors process sequence; no invented elements. Edge cases (e.g., landlord pushback, custom clauses) directly echo description's "exceptions" and "decision points."

- **Clarity & Polish (9.5/10, Minor Dings)**: Crystal-clear phrasing, excellent structure. Hypercritical issues: (1) Tiny typo ("**7.Repeated Processes**" missing space after 7.); (2) Trailing offer ("Let me know if you'd like to simulate") is extraneous/unnecessary for "produce a list," slightly diluting focus; (3) Example follow-up is insightful but not core "list," risking minor bloat. These are cosmetic but warrant strict deduction from perfection.

- **Overall Strictness Penalty**: 0.2 off for micro-formatting/excess (not "nearly flawless" at 10.0 absolute). No major flaws; outperforms typical responses in depth/utility.
