**9.8**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is exceptionally strong—structured, precise, insightful, and directly addresses all three tasks without fluff or deviation. It uses accurate time calculations (verified manually: all cycle times and gaps exact, e.g., Case 105's 28h post-escalation gap is precisely 28h from 10:00 Mar-01 to 14:00 Mar-02), clear visualizations (tables), and logical progression. Root causes tie directly to data (escalations in 102/105, handoff in 104, overnight gaps universally), with recommendations actionable and data-derived. Summary reinforces key insight (waits > work time).

**Minor Deductions (strictly applied, preventing 10.0):**
- **~1.8h average**: Technically 1h47.5m (107.5min); "~1.8h" rounds up imprecisely (0.1pt).
- **"Over 10x longer" for Case 102**: 25.17h / 1.79h 14x; phrasing understates slightly, minor logical looseness (0.05pt).
- **Trailing question ("Would you like...")**: Unnecessary solicitation beyond task scope; risks implying incompleteness (0.05pt).

No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws in analysis—outliers correctly flagged (102/104/105 vs. fast 101/103), patterns (escalations/overnight waits) evidence-based, no assumptions (e.g., distinguishes 104's non-escalation delay). Flawless on strict metrics.
