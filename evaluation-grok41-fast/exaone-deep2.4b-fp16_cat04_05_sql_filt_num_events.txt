9.0

The query is logically correct, efficiently computes counts once via CTE, correctly filters cases with `event_count <= 6`, and returns all events (`SELECT *`) from only those cases, matching the task precisely (including edge cases like exactly 6 events or fewer). DuckDB syntax is valid. No runtime errors or incorrect results expected.

Minor deductions for:
- Unnecessary `DISTINCT` in `valid_cases` CTE (redundant since `case_counts` already yields unique `case_id`s post-GROUP BY; adds trivial overhead and deviates from optimal conciseness).
- Explanation inaccuracy in point 3: "(those with 6 events)" omits "or fewer," creating inconsistency with point 2 and the task/prompt (could confuse readers despite correct query).

A 10.0 requires zero redundancies, imprecisions, or suboptimal elements (e.g., a HAVING-based subquery without extra CTE/DISTINCT would be flawless).
