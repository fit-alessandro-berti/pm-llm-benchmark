This response is exemplary: perfectly accurate in identifying the visualization type, structure, time range, and visual elements (e.g., gray diagonals for "Send Fine" to "Insert Fine Notification," pink/red fans for batched "Send for Credit Collection"). It provides clear, insightful interpretations (steady issuance, periodic batches, delays) that directly align with the image's patterns, while maintaining concise structure and domain relevance (process mining/traffic fines workflow). No errors or omissions.
