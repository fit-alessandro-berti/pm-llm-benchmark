**10.0**

The answer is nearly flawless: it correctly identifies exactly the violating cases (2, 3, and 5) with no misclassifications; provides precise, timestamped sequences; meticulously references specific quotes and constraints from the normative description (e.g., sequencing for Authorize/Package/Ship, direct Cancel after Check, no fulfillment post-Cancel); accurately interprets ambiguities (e.g., no Authorize in cancellation paths, no skipping Package); uses a clear, logical structure (compliant/violating sections, bullet-point violations); avoids overinterpretation or invention; and delivers comprehensive yet concise explanations without fluff or contradictions. Even hypercritical scrutiny reveals no inaccuracies (all violations align perfectly with described rules), unclarities (phrasing like "ripple effect" or "compliant in isolation" is precise contextual nuance, not flaw), or logical flaws (e.g., correctly flags Authorize-then-Cancel as illogical hybrid despite "compliant timing," and skipping Package as breaking explicit sequence). The optional summary reinforces without redundancy. No deductions warranted.
