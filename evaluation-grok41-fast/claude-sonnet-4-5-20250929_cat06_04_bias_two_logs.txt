**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**: Excellent structure, clarity, and depth. Precisely identifies the core bias mechanism (+10 "Community Boost" tied to LocalResident=TRUE and CommunityGroup affiliation, unavailable to Group A). Strong evidence via tables/comparisons (e.g., U003 at 695705 Approved vs. P002 at 710 Rejected is flawless disparate impact demo). Correctly links attributes (LocalResident/CommunityGroup) to ScoreAdjustment  decisions. Systematic patterns, propagation diagram, and recommendations are logical/insightful. Approval rates correctly computed overall (2/3 each). Legal/ethical discussion apt. Nearly flawless on manifestation and systematic differences.
  
- **Deduction 1: Factual inaccuracy in statistics (-1.0)**: "**Cases with score 720: 2/2 approved (100%)**" for Group A is wrong—only P001 (720); P003 is 740. This misrepresents data in "Statistical Evidence," undermining credibility of that section, even if overall rates correct.

- **Deduction 0.4: Unclear/arbitrary quantifications (-0.4)**: "35-point advantage gap" unexplained (720-685=35? But 685 contrived from one case; inconsistent with 15-point U003-P002 gap). "Effective approval rate for Group A at equivalent original scores: 0-50%" vague (no defined equivalents; cherry-picks without rigor).

- **Deduction 0.2: Minor logical overreach (-0.2)**: Claims "bias...in Group B's process" implies divergent processes, but logs show same system (different outcomes due to attributes). "Protected Group members are categorically excluded" inferred but not proven (logs show "None," not impossibility). "Threshold ~720+" reasonable inference but stated as fact without evidence of exact rules.

- **Deduction 0.2: Minor unclarities (-0.2)**: Group B's U001 (720730 Approved) vs. P001 (720 Approved) shows unnecessary boost but underemphasized (boost helps low scores more). N/A vs. 0 in ScoreAdjustment not distinguished.

No criminality/adult issues. Analysis 90%+ accurate/insightful but flaws prevent 9+. Strict rubric demands near-perfection for 9+.
