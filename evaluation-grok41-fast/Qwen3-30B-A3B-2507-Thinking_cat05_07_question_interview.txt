**9.7**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
- **Strengths (driving high score)**: The list is exceptionally targeted, directly mapping to the process description's gaps (e.g., documentation issues in Q1/Q2, assignment weighting in Q3, exceptions in Q6/Q7). All 11 questions are open-ended ("How...", "What...", "Could you...", "Can you..."), probing exactly the required areas: missing details (Q1-2), decision criteria (Q3, Q8), roles/responsibilities (Q2, Q4, Q9), timing/sequencing (Q5, Q6, Q11), exceptions (Q6-7). Zero SQL/tech/implementation mentions—purely conceptual (e.g., Q9 focuses on coordination, not systems). Structure (sections, bolding) enhances clarity without verbosity in the core list. Q11 insightfully uncovers design rationale, adding depth. No factual inaccuracies or logical flaws in questions; they echo description precisely without assuming unstated facts.
  
- **Minor Deductions (strict penalties)**: 
  - Embedded yes/no phrasing in Q9 ("does IT wait...?") slightly undermines pure open-endedness, even as an example—could be rephrased to "how does IT proceed if...?" (-0.1).
  - Q1 presupposes "often missing/outdated" (description says "if any"); minor leading assumption (-0.1).
  - Extra "Key Rationale" section (bullets + summary paragraph) is unrequested (prompt specifies "a list"); adds value but constitutes unnecessary meta-content, violating "produce a list" concision (-0.1).
  - 11 questions is comprehensive but borders on overkill for "a series" (8-10 ideal); risks diluting focus (-0.1).

Nearly flawless—flawless core list elevates it to top tier; deductions only for hypercritical nits.
