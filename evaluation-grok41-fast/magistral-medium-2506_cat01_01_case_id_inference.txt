**10.0**

The final groupings perfectly partition all 18 events into 3 logically coherent cases based on unique patient demographics (age + gender), department consistency (with appropriate cross-department support like Radiology/Lab), timestamp ordering, and standard healthcare workflows (registration  triage/consult  tests/treatment  discharge). No events are missing, duplicated, or misassigned; sequences are temporally non-overlapping within cases and progressively logical; full event details are accurately reproduced in the output. Key observations correctly justify the inference without flaws.
