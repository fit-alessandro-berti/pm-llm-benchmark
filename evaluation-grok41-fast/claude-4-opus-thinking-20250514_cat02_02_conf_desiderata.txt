**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is **nearly flawless** in structure, completeness, logical flow, and adherence to the task's three parts. It correctly identifies **all** normative violations (only Case 2, with precise explanations of sequence reversal, post-rejection finalization, and missing mandatory "Inform Applicant"—a subtlety many would overlook). Desiderata analysis is accurate per case, properly distinguishes severity (suboptimal/not severe), and covers timings/follow-up comprehensively. Interpretations/justifications are insightful, on-point (e.g., weekends for Case 3), and aligned with constraints without fabricating details. Summary ties it together effectively.

**Minor Deductions (Hypercritical Only):**
- **Inaccuracy (0.5 deduction):** Case 2 desiderata states "Credit Check timing: Completed within 20 minutes"—log shows Application at 08:00, Credit Check at 09:00 (**60 minutes**). Misreading conflates with Risk Assessment (08:20). Factually wrong, though immaterial (<24h).
- **Minor logical imprecision (0.3 deduction):** Summary claims "Cases 2 and 3 show opportunities ... regarding timing." Case 2 has **no** timing deviations (its issues are purely normative); this incorrectly groups it with Case 3.
  
No other inaccuracies, unclarities, omissions, or flaws. Coverage of missing follow-up across all cases, separation of normative/desiderata, and recommendations are impeccable. Easily merits very high score; deductions are for true nitpicks only.
