### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This response is exceptionally strong—comprehensive, accurate, and directly aligned with the prompt's requirements (anomaly ID, hypotheses, investigative SQLs on specified tables). It identifies all key sample anomalies (e.g., out-of-order in 1002/1003/1004, missings, contradictions, financial inversions, low credit risks) without omission or fabrication. Hypotheses are plausible, multifaceted (system gaps, exceptions, training, data issues), and tied to data/flags. SQLs (17 total) are PostgreSQL-correct, efficient (CTEs, window funcs, PG-specific like FILTER/STRING_AGG/~ regex), relevant to hypotheses, and span log/orders/resources tables appropriately. They proactively investigate beyond samples (e.g., SoD, reworks, rates by order_type, data quality). Next steps are practical.

**Strengths (why not lower):**
- **Anomaly coverage:** Precise, data-driven (e.g., flags 1004's prepay + scheduled=N ship).
- **Hypotheses:** Balanced (technical/policy/human), no overreach.
- **SQL quality:** All executable on schema/data; clever (e.g., step_map, expected_depts, anomaly flags). Covers regressions, missings, timing inversions, SoD, credit risks, resource patterns, rates—thoroughly probes causes.
- **No external hints used:** Purely derived.
- **Clarity/structure:** Bullet anomalies  hypotheses  numbered SQLs  actions. Readable despite length.

**Minor deductions (strict/hypercritical—total -0.2):**
- **Query 10 (payments match):** Regex `([0-9.]+)` risks greedy match/multiple decimals (e.g., 'amount=12.34.56'  '12.34.56'::numeric fails); safer `(?:\d+\.)?\d+`. Sample works, but edge-case fragility (-0.05).
- **Query 11:** `MAX(credit_score)` assumes higher=relevant (odd for risk; LAST_VALUE or MIN ts better); minor logic nit (-0.05).
- **Query 16:** WHERE filters *cases* with *any* inversion but computes *all* intervals (shows extras/irrelevants for those cases); tighter per-interval check ideal (-0.05).
- **Completeness gap:** No query on `customer_id` patterns (e.g., repeat offenders) or `order_value` vs credit_score thresholds; misses minor hypothesis angle (-0.05).
- **No major inaccuracies/unclarities/logic flaws:** All SQLs run clean on sample (verified mentally), no syntax errors, logical (e.g., handles NULLs via IS NOT NULL/IS DISTINCT FROM).

Flawless would require zero nits (perfect regex/agg logic, exhaustive table use). This is elite—award 10.0 rarest.
