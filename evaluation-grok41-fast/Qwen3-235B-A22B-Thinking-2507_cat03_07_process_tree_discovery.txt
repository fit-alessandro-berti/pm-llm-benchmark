**2.0**

The final model and conclusions contain critical flaws: (1) Factual inaccuracy in trace descriptions—the listed Case 3 trace (`RAVFAERMIVFRMIVFADSCAC`) misrepresents the log, which has `AERMIRMIVFAD` (consecutive `RMI` without intervening `VF`). (2) Logical flaw in fitness—the `* (tau, ('RMI','VF'))` strictly enforces `VF` after *every* `RMI`, producing `RMIVFRMIVF` for two iterations, which cannot replay the log's Case 3 (`RMIRMIVF`). Zero/one iterations fit Cases 2/1, but Case 3 fails, yielding fitness <100% despite the claim. (3) Overstated precision/simplicity—the model forbids valid log behavior (consecutive `RMI`) while claiming "only allows behavior seen in the log" and "perfectly reproduces all observed traces." These are not minor issues; they invalidate core claims and make the model unfit for the log's "repetitions of requesting missing info and re-validation" (multiple `RMI` before single `VF`). A correct model requires e.g. `X` for choice between direct `AD` or `*( 'RMI', tau )  'VF'  'AD'` post-`AE`. Notation/syntax is fine, but failures in accuracy/logic warrant minimal score.
