### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (Supporting High Score):**
- **Completeness & Accuracy (Flawless):** All low-level events are perfectly grouped with no omissions, inventions, or misassignments. Groupings align precisely with temporal proximity, resource patterns, logical flow, and domain semantics (e.g., setup  assembly  finishing  verification). Covers both sample cases implicitly via repeatable pattern, as instructed ("infer rules"). "Measure weld integrity" logically stays in welding (immediate post-weld sensor check) rather than a broad QA bucket, avoiding overgeneralization; final visual is distinctly terminal.
- **Rationale Quality (Excellent):** Justifications are concise, evidence-based (e.g., "tight, resource-coordinated sequence," "tightly coupled"), and tie to prompt criteria (temporal closeness, resource types, phases). Distinguishes phases clearly (prep, structural join, finish, validate).
- **Naming (Strong):** Domain-relevant, intuitive names (e.g., "Welding & Joining" evokes assembly; matches prompt examples like "Assembly"). Consistent style across table/JSON.
- **Structure (Outstanding):** Table + JSON exceeds "structured representation" requirement; JSON adds value (descriptions, resources, ranges) without bloat. Tailoring section addresses full log smartly (group by CaseID, rules-based mapping).
- **Insightfulness:** Recognizes cross-case pattern, proposes scalable rules—directly achieves "Goal" of glanceable workflow.

**Flaws/Deductions (Strict, Significant Impact):**
- **Unclarity in Presentation (-0.4):** Table justification for Step 1 has garbled text ("from Operator  Robot  Heating Unit")—appears as copy-paste error/missing words (should be "Operator A, Robot Arm #2"). This creates momentary confusion, violating "clearly defined" output. Minor but "hypercritical" trigger.
- **Inconsistency (-0.2):** Step 1 name "Retrieval & Setup" (table) vs. "Retrieve & Setup" (JSON)—trivial typo, but logical flaw in unified output; forces reader to reconcile.
- **Minor Inaccuracies (-0.1):** Timestamp ranges are A1-specific (e.g., ignores B2's slight offsets like 08:02:05); Step 4 range is imprecise ("08:02:00" singleton). Resources/sub_events are representative but not exhaustive (e.g., omits case-specific AdditionalInfo). Table abbreviates events inconsistently (e.g., "Place on table").
- **Logical Nitpicks (-0.1):** No explicit per-case breakdown (prompt: "for each case"), though inference is valid. JSON timestamps use en-dash (–) inconsistently formatted vs. prompt's colons.

**Overall:** Near-flawless core analysis (would be 10.0 standalone), but presentation glitches prevent perfection. Deductions are "significant" per instructions but calibrated to severity—still elite response.
