The provided SQL query and explanation are flawless. It precisely identifies cases containing the exact consecutive sequence `'Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order'` using `LEAD` within timestamp-ordered partitions per `case_id`, ensuring no intervening events. It correctly filters for those where `ts_confirm - ts_create > INTERVAL '5 days'` (valid DuckDB syntax for "more than 5 days"), collects such `case_id`s distinctly into `bad_cases`, and excludes all events from them via `NOT IN`. The final result returns *all* events from non-matching cases, ordered logically by `case_id, timestamp`. No syntax errors, logical flaws, ambiguities, performance issues, or deviations from requirements—even edge cases (multiple sequences per case, ties, non-sequential matches) are handled correctly. Explanation is accurate and concise.
