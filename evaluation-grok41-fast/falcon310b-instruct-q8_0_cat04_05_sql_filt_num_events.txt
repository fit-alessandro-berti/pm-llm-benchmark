The provided SQL query and explanation are flawless. The CTE accurately computes event counts per `case_id` via `GROUP BY` and `COUNT(*)`. The `INNER JOIN` (default for `JOIN`) correctly associates all events back to their case counts without data loss or duplication, as counts are aggregated at the case level. The `WHERE cec.event_count <= 6` precisely implements the filter (excluding >6 while retaining 6), and `SELECT e.*` returns the full, unaltered event rows for qualifying cases. No extraneous clauses, no performance issues in DuckDB (CTEs are optimized), no assumptions beyond specified columns, and no logical flaws (e.g., handles varying event counts perfectly, no self-joins needed). Explanation is concise, accurate, and directly maps to query mechanics without redundancy or error. This is a model solution.
