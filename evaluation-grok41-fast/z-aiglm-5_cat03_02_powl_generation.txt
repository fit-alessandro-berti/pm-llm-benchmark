**10.0**

The provided code is a precise, correct, and elegant POWL model faithfully capturing the entire scenario without inaccuracies, omissions, or logical flaws. It uses nesting for parallel blocks (po_env, po_final) to modularly represent concurrency exactly as described ("no ordering constraints," "any order or concurrently," "both completed"), with the root forming a clean sequential partial order of composite nodes. Loop semantics match perfectly (BNC as body, D&R as redo). XOR has both explicit choices (no unwarranted silent transition). All dependencies are direct and minimal (e.g., cs  po_env enforces CS before DA/ACI; po_env  loop_config enforces both before loop). Labels match descriptions verbatim. Imports and structure align with prompt/example. No transitivity over-specification, no redundant edges, fully acyclic/irreflexive/asymmetric/transitive via construction. Executes as valid pm4py POWL.
