**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
The answer is strong overall—comprehensive, well-structured, accurate on core facts, and directly addresses all three tasks with clear headings, precise timestamp analyses, and plausible justifications. It correctly identifies Case 1 as fully compliant, Case 2 as normatively violated (with all three key issues: order, missing Inform, post-rejection Finalize), and Case 3 as normatively compliant but desiderata-suboptimal. Desiderata assessments are thoughtful, with correct calculations (~49h/51h for Case 3) and appropriate caveats (e.g., Case 1 follow-up not "definite deviation"). Justifications are creative yet grounded (e.g., logging errors, out-of-system comms). Extra offer for constraints is a nice touch.

**However, deductions for strict/hypercritical standards (even minor issues penalized significantly):**
- **Minor unclarities/formatting flaws (deduct 0.4):** Sequence notations use spaces ("Application Received  Credit Check") instead of arrows/, risking misread as poor typography or concatenation error. "data  cannot call" lacks punctuation/spacing, creating run-on. These are small but introduce unclarities in a precision task.
- **Minor logical/incompleteness flaws (deduct 0.3):** 
  - Case 2 desiderata: Claims "Timing desiderata mostly not assessable / overshadowed," but fully assesses Credit Check timing (correctly as compliant); feels evasive/inconsistent phrasing despite accuracy.
  - Case 1 desiderata: Hedging on follow-up ("not explicitly expected... cannot call definite") is reasonable but slightly over-cautious—desiderata explicitly encourages it "before closing," and log silence implies absence (like Case 3), yet doesn't flag as potential deviation symmetrically across cases.
  - No explicit summary sentence per task (e.g., "Cases 2 violates normative; Cases 3 fails desiderata"), though inferable—task asks "identify which cases," and body covers but lacks punchy top-level list.
- **Minor overreach (deduct 0.1):** Justifications for Case 2 "Finalize Documentation" as "rejection paperwork" strains rules ("do not finalize documentation" explicitly for rejected; this reinterprets label against "not allowed: performing Finalize Documentation after a rejection"). Plausible but borders on rationalizing contradiction rather than strictly "in line with constraints."

**Score justification:** 9.2 reflects "very high but not maximal" (nearly flawless content, ~0.8 total deduct from 10.0 for nitpicks). Flawless would require pixel-perfect clarity/logic/no hedges/formatting.
