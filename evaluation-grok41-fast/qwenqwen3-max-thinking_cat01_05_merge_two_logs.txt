### Evaluation Summary (Hypercritical Breakdown)
This answer is excellent in structure, completeness, transparency, and adherence to most requirements, earning a very high score. It produces a clear, chronological, enriched table with all attributes integrated thoughtfully (e.g., source tracking, alt timestamps, standardized naming from primary Log A). Reasoning is meticulously documented with strategy, per-event decisions, and conflict resolution—far exceeding basic needs. Chronology is flawless, uniques are handled correctly (Quality Check as B-only, Delivered as A-only), and Log A's primacy is respected.

However, under utmost strictness, minor but notable flaws prevent perfection:
- **Payment Processed merge (major deduction trigger, -0.5)**: Delta = 5s **exceeds** the specified "<2 seconds" tolerance (not "slightly"—5s is 2.5× the limit). Prompt mandates timing as key matcher alongside order_id, with "if cannot confidently match, leave separate." Semantics and uniqueness justify confidence, but overriding explicit tolerance (admitting it "exceeds" yet merging as "reasonable exception") is a logical overreach. Prompt's "e.g." allows flexibility, but not explicit rule-breaking with subjective rationale. Should have left separate or noted as low-confidence merge.
- **2s deltas for Order Received/Shipped (minor inaccuracy, -0.2)**: Exactly 2s difference is **not** "<2 seconds" (strictly  tolerance). Labeled "within tolerance" without caveat; hypercritical math: 10:00:00Z - 09:59:58Z = precisely 2s (not <2). Borderline but flawed under literal reading.
- **Window phrasing (-0.1)**: "±2-second window" implies bidirectional 2s tolerance (~4s span), but prompt is absolute difference "<2s." Semantic nit, but imprecise.
No other issues: no unclarities, no missing events/attributes, flawless table/output, perfect handling of non-overlaps/rich attrs, strong semantic mapping (e.g., "Shipping"  "Item Shipped"). Nearly flawless; deductions only for tolerance violations/judgment edges.
