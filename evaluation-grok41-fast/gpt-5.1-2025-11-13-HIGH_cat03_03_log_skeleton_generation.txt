8.0

### Explanation of Grade
**Strengths (supporting high score):**
- **Syntax and structure**: Perfect. All keys present, correct types (sets of tuples for relation constraints, dict of strset[int] for `activ_freq`, empty set for `never_together`). Python code is valid and parses as intended.
- **Overall logical flow**: Excellent capture of sequential dependencies. Reverse pairs in `always_before`/`always_after` (e.g., `('RO', 'CA')` / `('CA', 'RO')`) correctly enforce strict ordering. Chains back/forward perfectly model the linear process RO  CA  RI  PI [?QC]  PO  GSL  D  IC  RP.
- **Directly-follows**: Well-chosen for mandatory direct successors (e.g., ROCA, POGSL). Gap after PI correctly models QC optionality *within the answer's logic* (allows PIQCPO or PIPO).
- **Equivalence**: Reasonable and holds under `activ_freq` (pairs have identical counts of 1). Adds strong constraints without overconstraining.
- **never_together**: Correctly empty; no exclusions implied.
- **Comments**: Helpful and accurate *to the model's assumptions*.

**Flaws (strict deductions, -2.0 total):**
- **QC optionality (major logical inaccuracy, -1.5)**: Scenario describes QC as a standard step ("The picked items are inspected to ensure...") in the mandatory "series of activities". All other steps use imperative language implying requirement. Setting `'QC': {0,1}` explicitly allows invalid traces skipping QC (e.g., ...PI PO...), misrepresenting the scenario. No `always_after=('PI', 'QC')` or `always_before=('PO', 'QC')` to force it even if freq were {1}. Comment "# quality check is optional" asserts unsubstantiated assumption, confirming flaw.
- **Incomplete enforcement around QC (minor, -0.5)**: Even if optionality intended, lacks `always_after=('PI', 'QC')` to prevent QC too early/late (relies only on reverse `always_before=('QC', 'PI')`). Directly-follows skips PI entirely, allowing arbitrary inserts after PI (e.g., PI  other  PO), weakening model fidelity.
- **Minor overreach**: Equivalence pairs (e.g., ROIC skipping intermediates) hold but are stronger than needed; not a flaw but unnecessary for "representation".

**Why not lower/higher?** 10.0 requires *nearly flawless* (no logical gaps); this has clear scenario mismatch. Below 8.0 would ignore excellence in 95% of content. Hypercritical but balanced.
