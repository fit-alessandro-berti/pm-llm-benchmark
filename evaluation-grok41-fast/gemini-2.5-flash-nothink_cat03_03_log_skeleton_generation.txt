**7.0**

### Rationale for Grade (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Strengths (supporting ~7)**:
  - Correct overall structure: All required keys present as sets/dict per spec. Tuples in correct format (e.g., ('RI', 'CA') for always_before).
  - Excellent capture of linear fulfillment chain: direct_follows perfectly models RO  CA  RI  PI  QC  PO  GSL  D. Supporting always_before/always_after pairs for consecutive steps (e.g., ('PI', 'RI'), ('QC', 'PI'), always_after('PI', 'QC')) are accurate inferences from scenario.
  - activ_freq reasonable: {1} for core mandatory steps (RO to D), {0,1} for optional-ish IC/RP with justifying comments. All activities covered.
  - Good extras: always_before(('D', 'PO')), ('IC', 'RO'), ('RP', 'IC'); always_after(('IC', 'RP')). Aligns with logical flow.
  - Empty equivalence/never_together correct—no mutual exclusions or equivalents implied in scenario.

- **Weaknesses (deducting to 7.0, preventing higher)**:
  - **Logical inconsistency (major flaw, -2+)**: always_after.add(('RO', 'IC')) and ('RO', 'RP') *force* IC/RP to occur after RO (since RO={1}), contradicting activ_freq {0,1} allowing 0 occurrences. This makes the model self-contradictory—a trace with RO but no IC/RP violates always_after but satisfies freq. Comments admit "might occur"/optional, yet constraints force it. Hypercritical: Unacceptable incoherence.
  - **Over-constraining optionals (significant, -0.5)**: always_after('RO', 'IC') ignores "relatively independently"; IC could logically parallel shipping without forcing. RP depends on payment (not guaranteed post-IC).
  - **Redundancies/unnecessary (minor but cumulative, -0.5)**: always_after('RO', all core activities) redundant with direct_follows chain/transitives. always_after for direct pairs (e.g., ('PI', 'QC')) overlaps directly_follows.
  - **Code/presentation issues (minor but strict, -0.3)**: Stepwise building with numbered comments/placeholders feels like reasoning dump, not clean "construct dict". Extraneous `print(log_skeleton)`—task wants dict, not executable script. Hedging comments ("assuming", "often", "let's") show uncertainty, not confident model.
  - **Incompletenesses (minor, -0.2)**: No explicit always_before('CA', 'RO'), ('GSL', 'QC'), etc., for full precedence (though chain infers); no {0,1} justification strictly from scenario (implies mandatory series, but ok inference).

Nearly good (chain/ freq shine), but logical flaw + inconsistencies prevent >7. Flawless would be clean dict, consistent constraints (e.g., drop ROIC/RP always_after, set IC/RP={1} if forcing, add missing precedences), no print/comments.
