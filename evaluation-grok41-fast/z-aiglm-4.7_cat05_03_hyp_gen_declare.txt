**9.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies (Strength: Excellent, ~10/10)**: Precisely identifies the core logical deadlock (`existence(C)` + `noncoexistence(E,C)`  no E; then `responded_existence(AE)`  no A). Correctly ties to intended flow deviation without quoting prompt hints. Clear, concise, no flaws.
- **Hypotheses (Strength: Very Strong, ~9.5/10)**: Plausible, varied reasons (misconfiguration, mining errors, policy issues, mapping errors) directly matching prompt examples (misinterpretation, incremental changes, technical issues, business pressures). Independent presentation; creative without speculation overreach. Minor deduct: Could explicitly link one to "pressure to handle claims quickly" (e.g., fast-track skipping steps), but not required.
- **SQL Verification (Strength: Strong but Flawed, ~8.5/10)**: 
  - All queries PostgreSQL-valid, use correct tables/joins/EXISTS, target key anomalies (coexistence violations, AE failures, "impossible" traces).
  - A: Perfect for noncoexistence check; adds useful context columns.
  - C: Insightful extension to full "degraded" traces (no P/N too); aligns with checking undermined logic.
  - **B: Logical flaw penalizing score** – INNER JOIN to `adjusters` on `resource = name::text` incorrectly filters to only 'A' events by exactly matching adjuster *names* (unreliable per schema: `resource` is generic VARCHAR for "adjuster or system"; no FK guarantees match to `name`, and `::text` is superfluous/unneeded). This misses violations where `resource` is 'system', ID string, or unmatched name, undermining completeness for `responded_existence` check. Prompt examples (e.g., "evaluation steps always correspond with assigned adjusters") justify *optional* adjuster use, but core task demands accurate anomaly detection without extraneous filtering.
- **Overall Structure/Independence (Strength: Perfect, 10/10)**: Clean sections; no prompt hints leaked; self-contained.
- **Strict Penalties**: Minor SQL inaccuracy in B (filtering bias) is a logical flaw  -0.5; no coverage of "closed without evaluation" explicitly (implied in C but not direct query like `C exists AND NOT E`)  -0.3. Total deduct ~0.8 from 10.0. Nearly flawless but not zero issues.
