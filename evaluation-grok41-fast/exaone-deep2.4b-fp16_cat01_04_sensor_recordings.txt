**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (for transparency, not part of response):
- **Strengths (boosting score)**: Excellent structure matching prompt (clear groups, labels from examples, detailed sensor-based rationales, sequence summary). Correctly identifies core patterns: events 4-6 as cutting (rising temp/vib/flow/tool movement logical), event 9 as welding peak (perfect fit), 11-12 as assembly (low-intensity post-process logical). Handles non-activity events sensibly as unlabeled transitions/resets without forcing labels. Intuitive deductions align with manufacturing logic (e.g., no flow in welding, tool path in cutting).
- **Flaws (deducting points, strictly penalized)**: 
  - Factual inaccuracy in welding rationale: Claims "Pressure: Stays at 2 bar" – event #10 is 1 bar (direct table error, undermines credibility).
  - Logical weakness in grouping: Event #10 (temp 30°C, vib 1 Hz, energy 1 kWh, press 1 bar) poorly matches "extreme" welding metrics (which apply only to #9); better as transition (similar to #7-8), creating inconsistency.
  - Minor inaccuracy: Assembling temp "25–21°C" – both events are 25°C (typo/misread, but hypercritical penalty).
  - Unclarity: Doesn't explicitly address/explain event #10's drop-off in rationale; implies group-wide highs without qualification.
- **Overall**: Nearly flawless in scope/insight (90%+ alignment), but errors/logic slips prevent 9+ (strict per instructions). Equivalent to A- work: strong analysis, minor execution issues.
