The provided answer delivers a flawless DuckDB SQL query that precisely meets the benchmark requirements: it correctly identifies cases with 6 events using `GROUP BY case_id` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`, then returns the full set of events (`SELECT *`) for only those cases via an efficient `IN` subquery. The syntax is standard, DuckDB-compatible, and logically sound, handling all specified criteria without errors, ambiguities, or inefficiencies.
