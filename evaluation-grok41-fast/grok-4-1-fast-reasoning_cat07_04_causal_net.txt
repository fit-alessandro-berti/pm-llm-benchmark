**10.0**

### Rationale
- **Accuracy (perfect)**: Matches the diagram pixel-for-pixel. Correctly identifies all nodes (a–h, f, z, "reject request"), flows (parallel paths from a to b/e and c/d/e; e branches to g/h/z; f loop from e), enclosed decision box, and exact gateway symbols/labels (XOR/AND/OR splits as black-filled diamonds/+/O; joins as hollow).
- **Completeness (perfect)**: Covers structure, notation (BPMN-style), interpretation (request workflow with branches/loops), key features (parallelism, loop, gateways), and table for clarity.
- **Clarity & Structure (excellent)**: Well-organized (overview, main flow numbered, table, interpretation); concise yet thorough; no speculation or errors.
- **Depth**: Insightful (e.g., gateway types, purpose as ticket/complaint process) without overreaching.

No deductions—flawless response.
