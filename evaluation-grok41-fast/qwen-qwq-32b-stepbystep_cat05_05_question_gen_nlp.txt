**10.0**

The final list of 20 questions fully complies with the prompt: it provides exactly 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions (all starting with "How" or "What," encouraging discussion rather than yes/no answers), focused precisely on insights (e.g., Q6 on data synchronization, Q20 on R&D collaboration), potential issues (e.g., Q2 on coordination challenges, Q10 on cultural barriers), strategies for improvement (e.g., Q17 on reducing lead times, Q19 on sustainability measurement), and decision implications (e.g., Q12 on carbon vs. speed trade-offs, Q15 on currency risks). All questions directly reference and expand on the described process elements (R&D, multinational sourcing from specified countries, Malaysia assembly, JIT/aggregated logistics, quality/compliance, digital systems, after-sales, sustainability, etc.) without any SQL, extraneous content, inaccuracies, unclarities, repetitions, or logical flaws. Coverage is comprehensive and balanced across process stages, with no gaps or overreach.
