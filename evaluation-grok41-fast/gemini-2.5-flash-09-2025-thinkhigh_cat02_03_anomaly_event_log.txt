**10.0**

The response is exemplary: comprehensive, precise, logically structured, and free of inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws. It correctly identifies all key anomalies across Cases 1002–1004 with exact timestamp references, uses domain-specific terminology (e.g., "3-way match," "maverick buying," "confirming PO") accurately, structures analysis via clear tables for readability, ties explanations directly to standard P2P controls and risks, and provides a concise summary without redundancy or overreach. Case 1001 is appropriately affirmed as standard. No omissions, no logical gaps, no minor issues—flawless under hypercritical scrutiny.
