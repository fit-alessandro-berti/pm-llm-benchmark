The provided answer is nearly flawless. The SQL query correctly uses window functions (LAG for the preceding 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and LEAD for the succeeding 'Confirm Order') partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `timestamp` to detect contiguous sequences precisely as required. The time difference filter `(s.confirm_order_time - s.create_order_time) > INTERVAL '5 days'` is syntactically valid in DuckDB (timestamp subtraction yields an INTERVAL, and literal comparison works), accurately capturing "> 5 days." The `NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT case_id)` correctly excludes entire cases meeting both criteria while returning all events (`SELECT *`) from qualifying cases. Edge cases (e.g., missing prev/next events yield NULL, failing filters; multiple sequences per case handled by DISTINCT) are properly managed. No extraneous grouping/ordering is added (unrequired by prompt), and filtering is exact.

The accompanying explanation is precise, structured, and directly maps to the query logic without errors or ambiguities. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., explicit `, 1` in LAG/LEAD; NOT IN vs. LEFT JOIN) are optimal or equivalent and do not impact correctness. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities.
