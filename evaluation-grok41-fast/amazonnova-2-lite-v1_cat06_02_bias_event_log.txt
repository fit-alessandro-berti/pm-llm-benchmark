**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Assessment)
This answer is strong in structure, clarity, and depth on the **explicit community bias** (+10 adjustment for Highland Civic Darts Club), correctly identifying its manifestation, impacts, and implications with precise references to cases (e.g., C001/C004 vs. others). The table, fairness/equity analysis, and recommendations are logical, comprehensive, and actionable, directly addressing the question's core on favoring groups (CommunityGroup) and equity for non-affiliated. It aptly considers social capital/geographic proxies and broader risks.

**However, significant flaws prevent a higher score (strict deduction for each):**
- **Major inaccuracy/oversight on LocalResident bias (deduct ~1.5):** Explicitly states in table "No differential treatment observed" for `LocalResident`—**false**. Evidence shows favoritism: All TRUE (C001/2/4) approved (even C004 at **final 700**); FALSE mixed but C003 **rejected at 715** (higher than C004's 700). This indicates resident-favoring in Rules Engine decisions, lowering effective threshold for TRUE (geographic bias per question). Answer downplays as "latent" or "compounding," without identifying as attribute favoring groups. Misses question's "geographic characteristics."
- **Logical flaw in decision analysis (deduct ~0.8):** Claims +10 "lowers effective threshold" for community, but ignores **700 approved (C004 TRUE/affiliated) vs. 715 rejected (C003 FALSE/none)**—inconsistency unexplained, implying uniform threshold (speculative: "likely due to score threshold"). Undermines claim that community alone explains outcomes; suggests compounded resident bias.
- **Unclarity/ambiguity in comparisons (deduct ~0.3):** Fairness example "C003 (score 715) rejected, C001 (score 710) approved" omits finals (C001=720) and ignores C004 700, weakening "similar risk profiles" argument.
- **Minor overreach (deduct ~0.2):** Speculates Highland Club as "geographic/cultural" without log evidence; equity definition slightly off (equity is about adjusting for disadvantage, not "boost only for them"—but implications correct).

**Net: ~85% flawless on community (9+/10), dragged to 7.2 by core misses on LocalResident/decisions (not "nearly flawless").** Well-written overall, but strict criteria demand completeness on all attributes/outcomes.
