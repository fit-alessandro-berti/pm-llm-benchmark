**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**: 
  - Table format is clean, includes required attributes (Case ID, Activity, Timestamp) plus useful extras (Application, Document/Context). Sequential per case.
  - Activity names are well-standardized/abstracted (e.g., "Edit Document Content", "Save Document"), avoiding raw verbs; meaningful for analysis.
  - Case grouping is plausible and coherent (document-centric with supporting tasks bundled logically under DOC-001; narrative of "integrating data sources into new doc" fits sequence/temporal context). Explanation justifies choices clearly, addresses why two cases, handles initial FOCUS, ignores low-level (SWITCH/SCROLL) appropriately.
  - Covers ~85-90% of key raw events via aggregation; tells a clear story suitable for tools like ProM/Celonis.
  - Explanation fulfills objective 6: brief, structured, covers logic.

- **Weaknesses (deductions for strictness; each minor flaw penalized ~0.2-0.5)**:
  - **Incomplete coverage/data loss (-0.8)**: Several raw events unrepresented/missing: 09:05:30 TYPING Excel ("Insert new row for Q2") has no table row (only one Update row covers prior TYPING inconsistently); 09:02:30 SCROLL email ignored without aggregation into "Reply"; 09:05:00 FOCUS Excel dropped; 08:59:50 initial FOCUS Quarterly dropped entirely (explanation calls it "preparatory" but could/should aggregate as "Start/Open Quarterly" for completeness in DOC-002).
  - **Inconsistent abstraction (-0.6)**: Doc1 early TYPING  two separate "Edit" rows; Excel TYPING  one row (lossy); email CLICK Reply (09:02:45)/TYPING (09:03:00) absorbed but timestamps wrong.
  - **Timestamp-activity mismatches (-0.4)**: "Reply to Email" at 09:02:00 (raw = CLICK *Open* Email); ignores later CLICK Reply (09:02:45). Minor but inaccurate for precise event logs.
  - **Logical/minor unclarities (-0.3)**: Own case def ("document editing session") slightly stretched by bundling email/PDF/Excel (plausible inference but not "editing" per examples like "handling a particular email"); explanation minor inconsistency (DOC-002 start "at 09:07:45" vs table 09:07:15). No rep for PDF "open" (starts at SCROLL).
  - **No major flaws**: No criminal/low-quality issues; no raw verbs; temporal order preserved; extra attrs useful. Not 10.0 (not "nearly flawless"—cumulative minors compound).

Overall: Excellent structure/logic (near 9+ base), but strict penalties for incompleteness/inconsistencies drop to 8.2. Usable/analyst-friendly but requires minor cleanup for perfection.
