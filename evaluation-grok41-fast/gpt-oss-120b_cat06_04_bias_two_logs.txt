**7.2**

The answer correctly identifies Group B's log as exhibiting bias, accurately attributes it to the CommunityGroup-linked +10 ScoreAdjustment manifesting as score inflation and preferential approvals (e.g., U003's 695  705 Approved vs. equivalent low scores rejected without boost), and properly considers LocalResident (not causal) and systematic differences (advantage for darts club subset in B, none in A). The comparison table, manifestation breakdown, and remediation are strong and relevant. However, strict evaluation reveals multiple flaws penalizing the score:

- **Inaccuracy in approval rates (point 3 & table)**: Claims Group B's rate is "higher (2/3  66%) than ... Group A (2/3  66%)", which is contradictory and false—rates are identical, undermining the "systematic" claim quantitatively.
- **Factual error on boosted cases (point 3)**: States "the two boosted cases would have been rejected under the raw-score rule", but U001 (720) matches P001 (720 Approved) and would *not* be rejected; only U003 would.
- **Speculative/unclear threshold (point 2)**: Assumes a fixed "710" rule (from single 710 rejection) then pivots to "e.g., 700" for 705 Approved without evidence from logs; ignores A's 720 Approved  imprecise on decision rule inconsistencies.
- **Minor unclarity**: "Same raw scores (720,710,695)" for B vs. A's 720,710,*740* implies false equivalence in pairing; disparate impact discussion hedges on correlation without log evidence.

These are not ignorable (even if scattered), as they appear in core explanatory sections and summary ("more approvals"), creating logical inconsistencies. Core conclusion holds, but not "nearly flawless"—downgraded significantly per strict criteria.
