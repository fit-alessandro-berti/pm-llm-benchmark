**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: 
  - Anomalies section excellently identifies the core contradiction (noncoexistence of E/C vs. ideal flow requiring both; existence C + responded_existence implying E path conflicts). Point 2 correctly notes weak precedence allowing skips. Point 3 validly highlights model gap undermining business logic (resource/specialization ties to schema/intent). Aligns tightly with prompt.
  - Hypotheses perfectly mirror prompt examples (misinterpretation, incremental changes, data issues, efficiency pressure) with clear, relevant explanations. No fluff or irrelevance.
  - SQL strategies cover prompt examples comprehensively (closed w/o eval, E/C coexist, eval w/ assigned adjusters). Queries 1,2,4,5 are logically sound, PostgreSQL-correct, schema-accurate (proper joins on claim_id/resource/name, timestamp logic, substring hack works for examples). Query 4 creatively addresses adjuster correspondence/specialization.
  - Structure independent, no leaked hints; concise yet thorough.

- **Flaws Penalized Severely (why not 10.0/9.5)**:
  - **Major inaccuracy in Query 3**: LEFT JOIN logic fails for traces with multiple 'A' events. If A1 (before E) and A2 (after E), query produces rows for both; the A2 pair satisfies `ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp`, selecting the claim (false positive) despite valid prior A. Does not correctly verify "exists prior A" (requires NOT EXISTS subquery or MIN(timestamp) aggregation). This breaks verification utility for responded_existence/precedence anomaly. (-1.5)
  - **Minor logical stretches**: Anomaly 3 frames resource oversight as core "anomaly" but model lacks any resource constraint (it's a desirable addition, not contradictory rule). Query 5 flags *any* out-of-order pair but doesn't aggregate to "all C after all E" (minor, as it detects violations). No DISTINCT in queries 3/5 risks duplicates. (-0.3)
  - No query for init(R) or full precedence(C after R) despite model having them; coverage good but incomplete for all constraints. (-0.2)

Nearly flawless (90%+), but SQL execution error + small gaps prevent top score under hypercritical lens. Equivalent to A- in academic grading.
