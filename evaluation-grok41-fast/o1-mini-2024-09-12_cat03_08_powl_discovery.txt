**2.0**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation):
- **Major logical flaws in POWL structure (deduct 4+ points)**: The model includes standalone `AS` and `TST` transitions as root nodes *and* as children of loops (`loop_iqc_as` and `loop_tst_rt`), with edges `QS  AS  loop_iqc_as` and `loop_iqc_as  TST  loop_tst_rt`. This forces *mandatory duplication* (at least AS-AS-TST-TST in every trace), which no event log trace replays correctly. E.g.:
  - Case 4 (AS  TST): Model generates AS(pre)-AS(loop)-TST(single)-TST(loop)  AS AS TST TST (extras, no IQC skip).
  - Case 2 (AS  IQC  AS  TST): Model minimal AS AS TST TST (wrong order/count, misses IQC); with IQC attempt: AS AS IQC AS TST TST (extras).
  - No trace matches; model fails to replay *any* log.
- **Inaccurate loop modeling (deduct 2+ points)**: LOOP semantics (`*(A, B)` = A then [exit | B  A  ...]) misapplied. Pre-loop singles make loops unskippable/duplicative. Can't produce case 4's IQC skip or case 1's exact AS-IQC-AS. Consecutive IQCs (case 3: AS  IQC  IQC) impossible (LOOP forces AS between IQCs).
- **Technical issues in code (deduct 1 point)**: Same `AS`/`TST` objects in root `nodes` *and* as loop children — likely violates POWL uniqueness (pm4py `StrictPartialOrder` expects distinct nodes; duplicate refs break semantics). Nodes list mixes siblings/children illogically.
- **Unclarities/inaccuracies in explanation/visual (deduct 0.5+ points)**: Visual/loop descriptions ignore pre-loop singles (e.g., claims "AS  [Loop: AS  IQC]" but executes AS-AS-...). Misstates loop behavior (e.g., IQC loop "AS then IQC, loop to AS" but placement adds extra AS). Claims "captures complex process" — false.
- **Minor positives (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies loops conceptually (testing/rework), optional LB as XOR(skip), linear chain via `order.add_edge`. Syntax valid Python.
- **Overall**: Fundamentally broken; doesn't "represent this complex process" or "capture these relationships." Not even close to flawless — severe inaccuracies prevent usability. 2.0 for basic operator use/attempt.
