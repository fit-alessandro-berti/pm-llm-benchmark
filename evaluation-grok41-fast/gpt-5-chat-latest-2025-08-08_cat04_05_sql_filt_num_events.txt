**9.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown):
- **Correctness (Primary Strength, 10/10)**: The main JOIN-based query is **flawless**. It precisely identifies qualifying `case_id`s via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`, then returns *exactly* the original event rows (`SELECT e.*`) for those cases. Standard SQL, DuckDB-compatible, handles "at least" columns perfectly (includes all via `*`), no logical flaws in grouping/filtering.
- **Clarity and Explanation (9.5/10)**: Crystal-clear restatement, step-by-step "How this works," and DuckDB notes. Minor deduction for phrasing "six or fewer events" redundantly (already in prompt), but negligible.
- **Completeness (10/10)**: Fully addresses task—no missing cases, correct exclusion (>6 events filtered out).
- **Alternative Query (Major Deduction, -1.0 overall)**: Window function is *functionally* correct for filtering but **flawed in output**: `SELECT *` from subquery includes the extra `event_count` column, violating "returns only the events" / "full set of events" (implies original schema only). This is a schema inaccuracy—not "original event rows." Presented as viable alternative without noting this, introducing potential confusion/misuse.
- **Conciseness/Extraneous Content (-0.5 overall)**: Task is "craft a DuckDB SQL query" (singular). Providing two is helpful but exceeds scope. Ending with "Do you want me to optimize...?" adds unsolicited interactivity, irrelevant to benchmark prompt (non-interactive). Minor bloat.
- **No Other Issues**: No syntax errors, inefficiencies matter only if wrong (not here), handles unspecified columns correctly.

**Nearly flawless** (main query perfect, extras high-quality), but window schema flaw + extras prevent 10.0. Strict deduction applied.
