**2.0**

The final POWL models contain critical inaccuracies and invalid syntax that prevent them from being correct representations:

- **Invalid StrictPartialOrder constructor**: The code passes `order=[...]` as a constructor argument, but per the POWL specification and example, `StrictPartialOrder` takes only `nodes` in the constructor; orders are added *post-construction* via `root.order.add_edge(source, target)`. This renders both models syntactically invalid and non-executable.
- **Flawed loop modeling**: `loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[request_more_info, check_completeness])` sequences as "Request More Info"  "Check Completeness"  repeat/exit. This incorrectly starts the loop by *always* requesting info (even on complete initial data), inverting the described logic (initial check first, loop to request/recheck *only if incomplete*). Proper modeling requires `children=[check_completeness, request_more_info]` for check-first semantics, with implicit exit on pass.
- **Missing process fidelity**: No distinct "Resume Parsing" activity (described explicitly); jumps from "Receive Application" to illogic loop. No handling for disqualification in skill assessment or borderline cases in managerial review.
- **Label mismatches**: Uses spaced labels (e.g., "Receive Application") vs. prompt's camelCase (e.g., "ReceiveApplication", "RequestMoreInfo"), reducing clarity/alignment.
- **Incomplete bias representation**: XOR correctly placed for unfairness, but "subtle uplift" or "implicit score adjustments" aren't structurally reflected (e.g., no silent transition or concurrent uplift); second model correctly removes it.

These are not minor; they break executability, logic, and fidelity. Structure is conceptually close but fundamentally flawed.
