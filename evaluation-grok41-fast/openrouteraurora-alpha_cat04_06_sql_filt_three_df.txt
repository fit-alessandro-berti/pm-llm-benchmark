**10.0**

The provided SQL query is flawless and precisely meets all requirements with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws:

- **Sequence detection**: The `ordered` CTE correctly assigns stable row numbers (`rn`) per `case_id` via `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)`, ensuring direct succession is captured exactly via `rn + 1` and `rn + 2` joins in `bad_cases`. This enforces no intervening events.
- **Activity matching**: `WHERE` clause precisely filters for the exact three activities.
- **Timing condition**: `o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5' DAY` correctly identifies >5 days (DuckDB-native interval arithmetic; exclusive of exactly 5 days as required).
- **Case exclusion**: `NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM bad_cases)` excludes *entire cases* with *at least one* matching bad triplet (correct per prompt: cases "contain[ing] the ... sequence ... *and* ... time elapsed ... >5 days"). Handles multiples gracefully.
- **Final output**: Returns **all events** (`SELECT *`) from `event_log` for non-bad cases only. Ordering (`ORDER BY case_id, timestamp`) is deterministic/readable (prompt mentions "proper ... ordering"; enhances without harm).
- **Efficiency/standards**: Standard SQL (CTEs, window functions, self-joins); DuckDB-optimized; no unnecessary grouping/aggregation.
- **Edge cases**: Handles sparse/dense logs, short/long cases, timestamp ties (stable via `ROW_NUMBER()`), multiple triplets (excludes on any bad one).
- **Documentation**: Comments and table are precise, concise, and pedagogically exact—no fluff or errors.

No deviations, assumptions, or risks (e.g., assumes sortable timestamps as per prompt; no NULL handling needed as unstated). Utterly correct.
