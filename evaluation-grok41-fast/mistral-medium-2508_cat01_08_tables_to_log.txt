**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Breakdown)
**Strengths (supporting high base score):**
- **Complete coverage of real events**: All actual events from tables are included accurately for *every* `order_id` (1001–1005). Order Created (from Orders), per-item "Item Picked" (granular from Order Lines, with different pickers/timestamps preserved), per-delivery "Order Dispatched"/"Order Arrived" (handling multiples/splits correctly, e.g., 1002's two deliveries), per-invoice "Invoice Issued", per-payment "Payment Received". No missing real events. Chronology perfect within cases (e.g., picking before dispatch, invoices after arrivals, payments after invoices).
- **Enrichment excellent**: Resources/Actors correctly mapped (sales_person_id for creation, picker_id for picking, carrier_id for delivery, billing_person_id for invoicing; "-" for payments where absent—logical). Additional Attributes richly populated (customer details, quantities, categories from Products, notes, amounts, methods—exceeds minimum).
- **Logical activity names**: Precise and descriptive (per prompt examples), granular where meaningful (per-item picking, per-delivery/payments).
- **Assumptions documented**: Notes clearly explain handling (e.g., multiples, incompleteness), granularity, timestamp logic.
- **Process mining readiness**: Flat row-per-event structure, sortable by Case ID/Timestamp, enriched attributes ideal for analysis.

**Flaws (strict deductions, totaling -1.8):**
- **Table structure (-0.8)**: Not "a structured table" but *fragmented into 5 separate Markdown tables* (one per order_id). Prompt specifies singular "table (in Markdown format)". This hinders direct import (e.g., to CSV/Prometheus) and global sorting; readability aid but violates format. Single table with all rows (sorted by Case ID then Timestamp) expected.
- **Invalid fake rows for 1004 (-0.8)**: Two non-events ("*No Delivery Record*", "*No Invoice/Payment*") included as rows with invalid "-" timestamps and italicized cells (*...*). These are *not events*, not "derived from tables", not chronologically placeable—corrupts log for process mining (breaks sorting, injects fiction). Prompt: "one row per event"; "document assumptions" (done in notes—*don't* embed in log). Logical flaw; treats absence as event. Real events (Created, Picked) are there—unnecessary pollution. Minor: Italics break Markdown table parsing.
- **Resource inconsistency (-0.1)**: Table uses IDs (e.g., "SP-001"), but notes claim mapping to names/roles (e.g., "SP-001 'Alice Brown, Sales Person'") without applying. Unclear/ambiguous; Resources Table provided for use.
- **Minor unclarities (-0.1)**: No explicit global sort confirmation (though per-case is chronological); 1004 fake rows use asterisks redundantly on Case ID.

**Overall**: Near-flawless content/logic (95%+ accuracy), but format/structural inaccuracies prevent 9+ (strict per instructions: "even minor issues... significantly lower"; fake rows alone warrant major deduction as core "inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws"). Polished, comprehensive, but not import-ready without cleanup.
