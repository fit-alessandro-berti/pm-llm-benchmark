### Evaluation Summary
This refined draft is exceptionally strong—clear, structured, precise, and fully aligned with the original intent. It transforms a somewhat run-on original prompt into a professional, benchmark-ready format with logical sections (Context, Task, Requirements, Expected Output, Note), eliminating ambiguities and enhancing usability for evaluators or LLM testers. It explicitly reinforces key elements like efficiency, full-column retention (implying `SELECT *`), and assumptions (non-empty table, non-null `case_id`), preventing common pitfalls in SQL responses.

### Strengths (Supporting High Score)
- **Clarity and Readability**: Bullet points, bold headings, and concise language make it scannable and foolproof. Original's wall-of-text style is obliterated.
- **Precision**: Reiterates "six or fewer" exactly; specifies "all rows... for cases with six or fewer events" and "all columns... and any others present," guiding toward correct queries (e.g., window functions or CTE joins).
- **Completeness**: Covers grouping/filtering mechanics, efficiency, and expected output shape without over-specifying (no unnecessary sorting/order).
- **Benchmark Suitability**: Notes on assumptions handle edge cases (e.g., no NULLs), and the meta-commentary justifies improvements while inviting extensions—ideal for prompt engineering.
- **No Logical Flaws**: Faithful to task; no contradictions, hallucinations, or scope creep.

### Hypercritical Deductions (-0.2 Total)
- **Minor Unclarity in Meta-Commentary**: The closing paragraph mentions "handling ties" (irrelevant here, as event counts are integers with no ties implied) and "specific sorting" (task-unspecified), introducing a trivial red herring that could confuse if misread as requirements. Not a flaw in the prompt body, but bloats the "answer."
- **Hyper-Minor Stylistic Nit**: "Write a DuckDB SQL query" assumes DuckDB-specific syntax needs emphasis, but the task is pure ANSI SQL (works in any DB); subtle overemphasis, though harmless.

Nearly flawless; only these microscopic issues prevent a perfect 10.0. This would reliably elicit correct SQL (e.g., windowed `COUNT <= 6` or CTE `HAVING`) from strong models.
