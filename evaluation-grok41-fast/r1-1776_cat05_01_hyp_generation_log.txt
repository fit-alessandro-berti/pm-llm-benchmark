**8.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Anomalies Identification (9.5/10):** Excellently covers key issues (out-of-sequence in 1002/1003, missing Validate Stock in 1003, payment-before-invoice in 1004) with precise examples tied to data. Minor deduct for not explicitly flagging 1004's missing Credit Check/Validate Stock (though implicitly caught) or Confirm Shipment= N but still Ship Goods (logical flaw unhighlighted).
- **Hypotheses (9.0/10):** Directly matches requirements (policy violations, system errors, data entry, training implied via controls, fraud). Reasonable, varied, and linked to anomalies. Slight deduct for vagueness in some (e.g., "pre-payment scenarios not accounted for" lacks tie to "training issues").
- **SQL Queries (7.0/10):** Queries 1-4 are **nearly flawless**—syntactically correct PostgreSQL, relevant to hypotheses, use CTEs/joins efficiently, target exact anomalies (e.g., #2 perfectly counts mandatory steps <7, flags 1003/1004; #3 exact for 1004; #4 correct dept mapping). **Major deduct for Query #5:** Syntactically invalid (BOOL_OR OVER() misuses undefined `cc.timestamp`; invalid `COUNT(af.*)`; broken GROUP BY `ord.order_value > [threshold]`; incomplete flags/joins). Logs errors on execution, fails to investigate high-value hypothesis properly. INNER JOIN in #1 risks missing some cases lacking prereqs (e.g., no VS row prevents flagging SG without VS, though #2 compensates)—minor logical gap.
- **Overall Structure/Insights (9.0/10):** Clear, concise final output; actionable next steps. No fluff post-<think>.
- **Strict Total:** Strong (flawless core), but broken #5 + minor gaps = significant penalty per "hypercritical" directive. Not "nearly flawless."
