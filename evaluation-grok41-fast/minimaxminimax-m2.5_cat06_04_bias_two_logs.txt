**7.2**

### Grading Rationale (Hypercritical Evaluation)
- **Strengths (Supporting High Base Score)**: Core conclusion is correct and precise—bias is exhibited in **Group B's log** via the `ScoreAdjustment` (+10 "Community Boost" for "Highland Civic Darts Club" members), absent in Group A. Excellent case comparisons (e.g., U003 at 705 approved vs. P002 at 710 rejected; U001 720730 vs. P001 720 approved without boost) clearly demonstrate systematic disparity. Accurately distinguishes `CommunityGroup` as the bias driver (not just `LocalResident`, which is correctly noted as correlational). Strong structure, logical flow, and discussion of structural implications (non-merit-based advantage leading to uneven decisions). Approval rate observation pivots well to mechanism despite sample size.
  
- **Major Deductions (Strict Penalties for Inaccuracies/Flaws)**:
  - **Factual Error (Heavy Penalty: -1.5)**: U002 summary states "PreliminaryScore 710 **Adjusted to 0** (no boost) Rejected." This is wrong—the score remains 710 with `ScoreAdjustment: 0`. Misrepresents data; undermines credibility of the numbered breakdown, even if not central to argument.
  - **Factual Inaccuracy (Moderate Penalty: -0.8)**: Claims "**Group B has a higher approval rate**... (2 out of 3... compared to Group A (2 out of 3...)"—rates are identical (66.7%). "Higher" is erroneous, even with "tiny sample" qualifier; sloppy contradiction.
  - **Typo/Minor Unclarity (Light Penalty: -0.3)**: "Highily Civic Darts Club" (misspells "Highland"). Repeated accurately elsewhere, but hypercritical standard flags it.
  - **Minor Logical Nit (Light Penalty: -0.2)**: Implies Group B uniformly benefits ("**Group B** benefits from a **bonus points mechanism**"), but U002 (Group B, no community group) does not—slightly overgeneralizes despite noting it.

- **Overall**: Nearly flawless analysis (90%+ accurate), but errors prevent 9+ (not "nearly flawless"). Solid for real-world use (7+), penalized strictly per instructions for any issues.
