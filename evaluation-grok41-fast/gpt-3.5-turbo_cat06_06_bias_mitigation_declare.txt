**3.2**

### Hypercritical Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Strengths (partial credit):** Format is perfectly preserved and valid Python (10/10). Original model unchanged. Introduces new activities and constraints as suggested (e.g., ManualReview, CheckApplicantRace, BiasMitigationCheck, Approve_Minority). Some additions are logically sound (e.g., response(CheckApplicantRace  BiasMitigationCheck) enforces eventual check after sensitive attribute; nonsuccession(CheckApplicantRace  Reject) prevents direct biased reject).
- **Major Logical Flaw (severe deduction):** Misuse of **coexistence** constraint, which is *symmetric* (A occurs  B occurs). Used for "if biased decision (Approve_Minority/Reject_Minority) then ManualReview," but enforces *bidirectional* obligation: ManualReview cannot occur without a biased decision, potentially blocking reviews for non-sensitive cases. Combined with new **existence(ManualReview)**, this *forces* existence(Approve_Minority) and existence(Reject_Minority) in *every* trace (absurd, mandates biased decisions always). Directly undermines bias mitigation; model now enforces bias in opposite way. Prompt suggests "coexists" but semantically wrong—responded_existence, response, or precedence needed for one-way enforcement.
- **Incompleteness (major deduction):** **Document Your Additions** requires "brief rationale for *each* added constraint." Lists only 3 (coexistence additions, 1 response, 1 nonsuccession), ignores: existence(ManualReview), succession(BiasMitigationCheck  FinalDecision), nonchainsuccession(CheckApplicantRace  FinalDecision). No rationale for succession (too restrictive—forces *immediate* FinalDecision after check, illogical for review). Explanation lumps/omits.
- **Inaccuracies/Unclarities (deductions):** Introduces inconsistent activities (Reject, FinalDecision, Approve_Minority without existence/responded_existence; assumes split "Minority" activities exist in log/process—unjustified extension beyond prompt's general "Approve, Reject"). nonchainsuccession(CheckApplicantRace  FinalDecision) unexplained; "chain" semantics unclear but potentially conflicts with other successions. Explanation claims response prevents "immediately follow" but response is *eventual*, not immediate (succession for direct).
- **Overall:** Ambitious but flawed execution; core bias mitigation broken by constraint misunderstanding. Not "nearly flawless"—multiple failures in logic, completeness, accuracy warrant low score despite good intent/format.
