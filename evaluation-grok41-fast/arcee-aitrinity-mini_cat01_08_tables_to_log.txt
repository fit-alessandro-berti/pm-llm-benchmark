The final event log table is nearly flawless. It comprehensively integrates all available data from every table into events grouped by `order_id` as the Case ID, with logical activity names directly derived from the tables (e.g., separate "Items Picked" per line item due to distinct timestamps/pickers, separate "Order Dispatched"/"Order Arrived" per delivery record for split shipments). All 5 orders are covered with **every available event** (34 rows total, matching data granularity: 5 created, 9 picked, 5 dispatched, 5 arrived, 5 issued, 5 received). Timestamps are precisely mapped and **chronologically ordered within each case** (verified for all, e.g., 1002: created  picks  dispatches  arrivals  invoices  payments, respecting parallel shipments). 

Resources are appropriately enriched where data supports (Orders  sales_person_id, Order Lines  picker_id, Delivery  carrier_id, Invoice  billing_person_id), mapped accurately to names from Resources table. For payments, inferring the invoice's billing person as actor is a reasonable enrichment (linked via invoice_id, no conflicting data; common in ERP for billing cycle). Other Attributes are relevant and non-redundant where added (e.g., customer details on create, specifics per event type), enhancing without excess. 

No data omissions, fabrications, or chronological errors. Handles incomplete cases (1004) correctly by including only available events. Markdown format perfect. No need for assumptions documentation as data is unambiguous/no gaps requiring invention—process flow reflects reality (e.g., picking pre-dispatch, invoice post-arrival). Ideal for process mining.
